than i am right now because you're wearing the wagon i wore it for you wow what is he opposing is he is he you know what's up i wore it for you am i opposed to wear a wacky shirt like i could be like yeah maybe he's like yeah maybe i'm a wolf in sheep's clothing i don't know wow that's what the w stands for yeah no i did i literally wore it for you have you trapped this nft game wolf no what is it like a wolf game and their sheep and like you shave the sheep and you get well like honestly people will say a word any word and it triggers me because there's like a crypto thing that involves it okay like say a word say a random word uh baseball okay uh they saw nfts nfc baseball cards you say a word um it's surprisingly hard to come up with a random word on the spot by the way i struggled with that i was like uh uh i mean pants pants um ooh like fashion nft for for pants yeah and also unisofts to go of course 115 000 pair of socks do you know about uni socks no fire what what are unison it's how many socks did they issue like 500 something like that yeah yeah so una swap issued a token called unisox that entitled you could redeem the token for physical pair of like white knee-high socks that have the pink unicorn on the side that's actually kind of fun and those tokens are now trading at anywhere from like 115 to 140 000. do you still get the physical socks no you just get the token so you redeem you have to redeem the token yeah but like when people go to an event they'll wear their unisocks and it's the biggest flex ever because there'll be a guy in the corner wearing like a fancy watch and like head to toe designer whatever and there's like a random crypto person in the corner wearing their uni socks you're like that person's literally wearing you know a range rover on your feet right now but that's kind of fire that's like i went to the ether rocks party that you hosted which was absolutely fire great party melting throw this absolutely bomb party so if you ever get invited to one you gotta go i went to this party and like the biggest thing with it that i came away with other than the fun time was like this whole idea of we're all status signaling monkeys at the end of the day that's what we we go through life whether we know it or not whether we're willing to admit it or not just like trying to stat a signal that we are like attractive that we're rich whatever just so that you can procreate and have sex like that's human nature or whatever it's the reality of it but that's why i bought an etherox so the minute i looked at etherox is like this is the perfect digital flex because the image itself is a free clip art image there's zero originality in it um the metadata it's not even the erc721 token the metadata associated with the etherox like very vague because it was built in 2017. it was one of the first nfts i didn't know that yeah and so it's so interesting that of course i got rock number 69 um and what was what did you pay for that i paid nine eth okay when i bought it it's now probably worth like the ether rock just sold for um 200 east kane warwick bought rock number 62. so my neighbor but what was really interesting about it is we've built this community now around ether rocks we call it stonehenge so there's a bunch of different people in it some people got into ether rocks early some people got into it later harella bob right um bob he bought four of them because he's a complete chad um but what's really funny is they've kind of built this community around etherox there's only 100 of them there's about seven of us in the chat together and one of the things i realized like wait a minute this is a community right and a lot of what's happening here is you're signaling you're belonging to a tribe and what's the ethos of the etherok tribe like it's fun it's weird it's a little bit sassy because it's basically you're lighting money on fire which is a flex in and of itself and that's why i wanted to do the event we're going to do an event here in miami as well that'll be you know similar but slightly different from the one we did in new york but ether rock ownership is like membership in an exclusive club and what's really funny is so i got an apple watch just to show off my ether rock and i was out with my friend he was wearing his rolex i was wearing my apple watch the ether rock on it we took a photo i was like which one of these is a bigger flex i write a rolex like thirty thousand dollars and ether rock at that point in time was three million dollars so it just helps sort of reshape our perception of value and so much of value is societal right it's memetic um and again scarcity is artificial right like rolex can make as many watches as they want gucci can make as many pairs of shoes as they as they want right um and so again i think what's been really interesting to explore is like there's a whole cadre of people in crypto who have made money but they're not motivated by the same status symbols as prior generations they don't want to buy yachts they don't want to buy private jets they don't want to buy you know houses they want to buy digital rocks they want to buy unisocks they want to buy membership in daos they want to build cool things so i think what's been really cool to see and what i'm excited about like my vision is in the next decade i want to mint a million new billionaires who have a radically different view of what we should value as a society i have a question about security okay so this has been on my mind so i just i was in the bahamas this weekend okay did you visit the ftx campus i did not okay that's on the main island right fdx campus that's right yeah so you were in what harbor island it's like a tiny little tiny little little wedding there and a little vacay i had a little vacay and jack butcher you might know um basically sold a bunch of like nouns uh sort of apparel yeah and i've got some cryptos you've got some kryptos i'm not staking my crypto but i've got i've got ones the nouns ones which are the most high valued so i bought some of the merch anyways i i'm packing for my trip and i'm thinking to myself like do i want to wear my nouns hat and because i'm kind of signaling to the world like i've got a wallet right i've got like some expensive stuff in it and i'm curious like you know in this world where we're all you know a lot of people are flexing status digital goods wallets like do you feel ever kind of like oh my god i don't want other people to know that i have this like how do you think about that yeah i mean i um i certainly am never gonna wear a shirt that says swag me i don't wear like crypto swag because again i think when i'm out in public i don't necessarily want people to look at me and be like oh this person has has crypto this is kind of a poser shirt though to be fair like this is like the i'm poor but i like crypto guys um but no it is something to think about one of the areas i've been investing in a lot is opsec and infosec so one of the things like i've been doing this for eight years professionally now right this has been a hot minute and so through that process you know my bitcoin i managed through a company called casa which i'm an investor in um which is a multi-sig storage long-term storage solution for also a customer amazing how do you find it great great experience we need to build the equivalent for ethereum right but basically the idea is like long term the things the value things you want to hold you want to hold them in a secure way so that's opsec and having good operational security um having a ledger or hardware wallet or a uv key linked to your software wallet right so that your assets can't be stolen um it's worth actually saying um on casa as it's an interesting example of this for like you don't even have to have like that much crypto in order to make this worth it but basically like casa as i understand it it's multi-sig so rather than like right now if you have cash you go put it in a bank account you trust that the bank is able to keep it safe for you and you just hope that that's true and if like the government one day freezes all your bank accounts and you don't have it you don't have access to that money and if you go to the bank account and they've done that in the past right like it's happening the great depression yeah when i want to spend my money at chase i've actually had multiple instances with jp morgan trays so i think with where i can't send wires and i have to go to physical bank branch they lock my account i have to go to a physical bank branch with two forms of id i have a lot of questions why are you sending this wire where is it going to what do you do for a living and i'm like this is your business 10 000 at a u.s bank account they have to flag it to the federal government yeah ten thousand dollars yeah absurd if you're gonna get ten thousand dollars in cash but casa allows you to completely own the security of your crypto well right now it's just bitcoin i would guess in the future they expand into other assets more assets but the other cool thing is they've also built an inheritance protocol right so if something should happen to you god forbid right they have a solution they've built that allows you to share some of the keys with family members a trusted lawyer third party instead of something wherever to happen your bitcoin would be passed to your next of kin um but the other component that i think is really important that you're touching on is infosec information security and this is where actually twitter has been a really interesting tool for me so i'm extremely visible online and i share a lot online like god bless you i talk to people they're like i feel like i know you because you share so much of your life that was how we became friends that is how we became friends through the internet um but the what i'm doing effectively is people are not curious about me because they feel like they already know me so it makes it easier to hide in plain sight and you practice really good info sex so i don't receive mail at my house i receive it at a registered agent who receives my mail for me and forwards it on to me packages get sent po box right you just have to think a little bit more about what you're disclosing and be really selective i never tag locations on things typically if i'm at an event i won't share anything about it until i leave the event so i think when you're in in crypto and again as the world shifts and more and more of our lives become digital like forget crypto like everything in our lives is digital we as a society just have to become more mindful of information security operational security and how we safeguard like these very important components of our identity our our privacy um and again i think people are just now starting to build the tooling and infrastructure it's not all crypto related either right a lot of this is just basic knowledge and teaching people how to have good opsec and go to infosec this is an interesting area what's the difference between opsec and infosec so operational security is having processes in place so for example whenever i use my metamask i'm going to plug into my ledger and that's operational security it's process driven right so when i'm performing various functions i have a process that helps me be secure in how i do it so it's like having manuals and guidebooks and a step-by-step process for how you do certain things to do them securely information security infosec is how you keep data secure and how you obfuscate certain pieces of information like pii personally identifiable information to help you maintain information security by the way if someone hasn't coined the term practice safe infosec yeah yeah that's good someone do it like someone dude that's pretty like that's the new practice we've been on that journey together for almost three years now i mean um it's been interesting because the mentality around security is shifting right a lot of people initially were like oh i'm not going to spend 125 or 1800 or 5 000 or at the different pricing tiers on this but as the value of crypto goes up and as people have nfts and baseball cards that are digital or maybe they have like i now have digital furniture right people start to think a little bit differently because again we're not accustomed to digital security we think a lot about our physical security but we never think about our digital security so i think there is a fundamental paradigm shift and actually i think one of the really interesting things something i've been really excited about which i want to get into is like i do feel like we're building the tools in the infrastructure to start to enable new models for small communities to organize to become more self-sovereign and to build resilience and security through decentralization and permissionless like infrastructure in new and novel ways and so i got a place in new hampshire earlier this year i've been spending a lot of time there with other bitcoiners i'm trying to get a lot of bitcoiners to move to the area the slogan for new hampshire is lit free or died so it's very like apropos that was where i used to go as a kid to buy fireworks to do stupid [ __ ] was because like new hampshire in massachusetts you couldn't get fireworks and so we'd drive up to new hampshire and buy a bunch of fireworks to go do our dumb [ __ ] right and that was like you were allowed to and you couldn't there was no sales tax no sales no government theft and so we were able to drive up there and go do that stuff well the government's very small right so what's interesting about new hampshire is the government's very small um for example like my trash gets picked up one day a week and then on saturdays i drive to the town dump and you like take your own recycling so it's very much like it's like libertarian it's much more liberating um so talk about this idea i want to go down the rabbit hole on this a little bit with you because it's fascinating so sovereign city-states okay and crypto and let's take one step back please so um one of the things i've been really interested in lately is belief right so money is a collective fiction right we and we can we don't need to get into this whole history of money like let's start with the number zero humans are narrative we're storytelling creatures actually right like mythos mythology stories that's how we've transmitted history through time that's how we remember who we are right and the stories are really just like fragments we've pieced together they've changed and evolved over time to fit whatever narrative we're trying to create i mean it's always the victors who tell the story right tell our history um but there is this really interesting movement so historically right people organized around religion around belief like around their perception of what's happening why we exist what's going on um we have this really interesting shift that started to happen where our societies are no longer driven by organized religion right it's no longer really driven by your belonging to your nation state or like nationalism is is not as prevalent as it was probably 20 30 years ago and so what's really interesting is there's this huge religious movement that's taking place it's the spiritual but not religious movement or sbnr and the harvard school of divinity has done a lot of great research and writing on this and under their estimates they estimate about 40 of the u.s population is spiritual but not religious they don't belong to a religious organization they're not a part of a church and what's really interesting is globally this trend is also growing right with secularization of society with people becoming more you know technologically oriented so there's this really interesting spiritual void that's been created and people are filling it in different ways i think crypto i think bitcoin was actually the first technocratic religion which is super interesting right you have the the myth of satoshi which is sort of the origin story you have sort of the early days of bitcoin in the bitcoin talk forum which is like our gospel like people quote satoshi on a regular basis i have like a set of satoshi quotes i like to use um and so we've built this mythology and this rich pantheon of characters around around bitcoin and what starts to become interesting right is how do we start to give this movement like its own mythology we already have our own terminology our own lexicon we have our own rituals we have our own icons right the ops like an infosec it's a ritual plugging your ledger into your computer like you going to church and doing your revolutions or you going to synagogue and like going to to pray so um i think there is this interesting sort of thing that's emerging and i think people are really uncomfortable by the term religion but religious organizations are not necessarily about religion in the traditional sense they're really just about belief systems right and people having shared identity and community right exactly about shared identity shared beliefs shared goals and that community you build and our community is on twitter which is great it is i mean you're blowing my mind a little bit here because i've never thought about it in this context but if you really do like i read um you've all know a harare had that book sapiens which was like an amazing treatise and all this stuff he didn't really get into bitcoin much i don't recall around money because i think it was written before a lot of that happened the second book 21 questions right or which one no yeah the follow-up to sapiens has had us a little bit on it but what's really interesting um right is if you look at bitcoin not through a technology lens but one of the interesting things that happened right in like 3000 years ago in ancient greece the way that philosophers and scientists looked at knowledge right there were two branches there was real physical knowledge which is chemistry and math right like observing and understanding the physical world and then there was the esoteric right and the esoteric was like philosophy but it was also magic and astrology and divination and all this like weird [ __ ] and somewhere along the path we focused only on the hard sciences and we forgot about the esoteric right but we're like literally creatures living on a rock that's hurtling through space at 60 000 miles per hour we need the esoteric and so it's been interesting is people are getting really into esoterica and crypto kind of combines the two because it has elements of mysticism and esoterica in it but it's also based on on math right on verifiable mathematical computation and so by combining these two together it's sort of like a reunification of these things that were separated long ago that belong together as a whole so i actually think there's a really cool opportunity i'm going to bring it back to new hampshire so there's a really cool opportunity to micro dose before this okay okay if you're if you're not watching this video if you're like listening to this in your ears literally we might create a meme out of the face i just his mind is blown continue sorry no no no so i just want to versailles bring it full circle to new hampshire so what i think is really interesting one of the things i'm going to try to do over the next few years is build a church so when i say a church it's a religious organization which enjoys certain tax benefits under u.s tax code and if we think about the wealthiest institutions of this country the religious organization the mormon church church is fantastically wealthy the largest landowner in america the church of scientology fantastically wealthy the vatican fantastically wealthy so if we can build a new religious organization a set of shared beliefs a shared it's a set identity around this new like technocratic money movement called bitcoin what we can start to do is amass a large amount of financial capital that helps us shift the political climate in this country to put new leaders into place to build a new political party which i think is really important it helps us shift culture by funding new cultural institutions which also enjoy tax benefits but think about like the state of education today we all know it's fundamentally broken that how do we fix it we can create new educational institutions that are funded by a religious organization and then lastly we can create new social structures and the social structure is this idea of a small community right of self-sovereign individuals who have um who adopt bitcoin right or other cryptocurrencies as their currency but also use open source tooling and infrastructure whether it's dowse or other primitives that are being developed or things we haven't even dreamed up or quoted up yet and they start to use these tools and you couple that with distributed computation publicly owned internet infrastructure isps telecommunications infrastructure and small-scale nuclear reactors right with companies like oakland start to bring that together and you start to see the development of a new type of city-state right that is self-sovereign that becomes a haven a refuge for people who are like-minded and these can start small but they grow over time and that experiment's happening across the world as these crypto people and their capital are going to these different places flocking together and building these small communities but we can start to to scale that and it's starting online too right so you're like yeah it's digitally it's it's you start online and then you gather the people and then you're like okay it literally starts on twitter yeah exactly but that's why i got on the party like the ether rock party right one of the realizations i've been sort of working through and thinking about is like these conferences we have and these events we have they're really like us going to mass totally right totally what's mecca energy that gets created right yeah it's going like going it's going to make it yeah exactly like that energy that gets created and the connections that get created they catalyze and like compound over time but that has existed like the thing i so i it's not i think no no but i like i think about all these things in like i'm a i don't know i'm a peon like whatever i i come from like a traditional world and i'm trying to understand all of these things and so for me i'm drawing analogs to what has existed i think about like what you're saying there um berkshire hathaway like warren buffett is a religion for a lot of people people literally 50 000 people a year go to omaha nebraska to go worship at the shrine yeah worship at the time and i've gone to it it's amazing and it's an amazing event you go and you meet a bunch of other people who have also worshipped at the religion of this like value investing whatever it was and what it is now now apple sort of a religion like people i'm there are a billion people in the world that have an iphone when i hold an apple iphone and there's someone on the street in india holding an iphone that's like a poor person on the street we have something let's talk about apple for a second so here's the next extension of this which i think is so interesting so we started with cathedrals right like cathedrals were the first monumental structures that got built after the pyramids so the pyramids were built it wasn't until four thousand years later that humanity was able to build a structure taller than the great pyramid of giza that's crazy why is that why is that do we know because of slavery dark ages and the rise of organized religion right and if you've read um the immortality key by brian moresku it's a great book about um ancient cultures and their relationship with the esoteric right this super interesting book i'm sure the mortality key the more the mr mortality all right i'm gonna check it out and it's about humans like our relationship with the divine and the inexplicable right um but organized religion basically like sought to crush the esoteric and when that separation happened there's another great book um called man's search for meaning by albert kessler one of the best books i've ever heard yes so good but it's about that separation right but so think about this it wasn't until 4000 years later we built a cathedral right and then cathedrals became the things that civilizations built now the cathedrals of capitalism right are skyscrapers if you look at the way apple is using architecture in the apple stores right this is a concept that like kerbasia was really passionate about and what heath like was building as an architect is these halls that felt like churches it's the sparse marble it's minimal it feels vast and kind of isolating but at the same time it feels inspiring like going into an apple store is in many instances like a quasi-religious experience and so this physicality of it and the structures we build is also so interesting which i'm really curious to see again as people in crypto start deploying their wealth into building small-scale cities into like moving to islands or other locales and building things like what will we build together but there is this like really interesting linkage if we look at all these artifacts around us right they're all a product of belief system and what we're trying to convey i have an interesting idea that i want to throw out here because i think you guys will have thoughts so one of the issues i see with all of this massive new wealth that's been created within crypto is because of our current fiat tax system there's not a great like re-onramp for all of that wealth to be put to productive use like there's so much wealth that's been created those people would love to build companies on the back of it build new protocols build uh like create jobs do all sorts of things that like create massive build great new cathedrals but like create massive wealth but currently because if they go use it or try to redeploy it there's like someone that's trying to go grab pieces of it there's not a great way to do it so i wonder whether the government or tax authorities whatever should basically create like a tax jubilee where people that have amassed a certain degree of wealth within crypto can like almost repatriate it into productive uses for free like no tax on the capital gains that they've created if they redistributed opportunity zones right totally like an opportunity zone for crypto okay but how about we don't give any money to the government which is absolutely incompetent and engages in a tremendous amount of grift yeah right because some of the worst capital allocators the system is just too large right it's gotten so large and so cumbersome like it will collapse under its own weight it's inevitable once we instead gave that capital to a religious organization and you got a tax deduction or the religious organization invests that capital it effectively becomes a hedge fund housed inside of a non-text entity and grows wealth there and deploys capital along you know the the spiritual or like um sort of societal aims of that particular organization so as long as that organization then was like community owned and governed so it's not like one person is the king of that religion and gets to decide where it goes i agree or the queen sorry yeah well be community i would be the queen it would probably be you so if it is myself a cult leader although i do joke like i'm going to start a cult but it's interesting to think about like a community owned amazing decentralized you missed that one she's like i'm not a cult leader but i you know i do joke that i like i'm starting to get called i am starting a goal i do run a cult but i'm not a cult leader no but if you could have that be community owned so now like people are able to contribute their the wealth creation into this entity that is community owned and can make decisions on behalf of this massive religion this is called a doubt right exactly as an autonomous organization and again the tooling around dao is still really primitive i'm a member of a number of dows i've run a number of dows um and um you know it's it's still really early stage dow's by the way like crypto is not a panacea to all of the challenges that exist in trying to build tools for social coordination like kryptos is not a panacea for anybody else in society it's just a tool that we can use but it is a really interesting tool it's being used in really interesting ways um then i think one example of that you know constitution doubt maybe is a bad example of that i think that you know it's funny yes like lol's but you had some good hot takes on it poorly organized um but you know that's an example of a group of people banding together i'm part of another dow called hashes dao where we collect generative art and that's been really interesting um so we created these substructures called permutations where you elect a team to run a specific permutation they get an allocation from the treasury and then they provide updates to the community on what they're doing and then anyone can propose to run their own sort of permutation i'm part of friends with benefits which is another doubt it's like a social club and so they've been doing a lot of cool stuff and they've had all these spin-offs and different programs that have come out of that but i think again we're at this really early stage of experimenting and i do think we're living through like this digital renaissance where you have crazy people on the internet who now have capital right we have financial capital we're going to buy some political capital we have a lot of social capital and we're going to use it to try really interesting new things and i think the other like the other thing i really focus on and this is where we get back to mythology our perception of reality right we collectively get decide what get to decide what reality is like all of us are collectively responsible for building the reality that humanity lives in um and a lot of us abdicate that responsibility right we like sit down turn on netflix and just tune out because it's really [ __ ] scary sometimes but i think one of the really cool things we can start to do with crypto and crypto capital and crypto wealth and these new structures is build new narratives and shift people's perception of reality to create a more optimistic and hopeful vision for the future and that's happening what's happening i completely agree that all of the people that are out there saying like crypto is a scam all of that like all the negativity around it if you actually go spend time at a crypto native event like i spent a bunch of time at nft week i was like reasonably deep in nfts and spent some time but i went and spent a week there and just spent time with people you know i'm laughing why i'm laughing because you're wearing a wii with a w-a-g-m-i and why is it wag me new york new york i stole it from one of the bars like they had these t-shirts from some like some venture firm that was trying to like say they were a big crypto venture firm i went and just grabbed the shirts do you know what wagner is of course yeah you're gonna make it yeah we're all gonna make it the a is really important yeah we're all going to be yeah you know what my initials are what are they gmi gm yeah there you go we're good you are mine but like my point these people um in general it's a very positive sum and very optimistic future group and so that's the funny thing that i think is like if you went and talked to a bunch of people that are working in crypto working in web 3 building these future things all of them are driven by like we're all going to go do something right this is collective that was constitutional we can say we hated it we can say we liked it it's kind of cool to just see people coming together around something no matter what because we don't see that often around positive around normally it's like i'm going to come together to take down this other group because i hate them and whatever it is and it's kind of cool to just see it in a positive spot i want to do i mean greg and i have this whole idea about going and taking uh a board seat at twitter with a dow to like go fix twitter because we think it's broken and so we like form a doubt but you use twitter you love twitter greg doesn't like greg's that's not twitter we're in the same boat if twitter was a better prop like if twitter could improve its product it would be so amazing but twitter can never improve itself because it's a public company um with shareholders and twitter doesn't serve as customers it serves as shareholders but what if a community dao was one of the board seats or or like had a significant building on the board like i serve on boards like the board is not really like culture yeah the culture at a company is really driven by its leadership but i'm actually really sad that jack stepped down from the ceo role at twitter because he really was the culture and say what you will like maybe they didn't ship anything new but i think twitter's primary appeal was that it was unchanging and it was uncompromising in its approach and now we've like lost this bastion of free speech right just today the new ceo came out and said you can no longer post um images of people in public which means you can't post police brutality videos you can't post protests you can't post memes you're right it's actually insane that can't be right though think about what that does like free speech dies in darkness yeah right democracy dies and darkness and democracy is [ __ ] dying right now look i there are certain people on the internet that i don't like i don't agree with a lot of people's viewpoints but that doesn't mean that they don't have the right to share their perspective right we have the biden administration coming out and openly saying we're looking at banning the social media accounts of people who do not believe in vaccines that's crazy the fact that no one thinks that's absolutely bonkers right yeah it is mind-blowing to me it's like [ __ ] crazy we're in a society without censoring free speech openly yeah and people are like yes let's do that i'm like this is crazy this is what happens in fascist countries yeah do you think much about decentralized social and where that's going yes and no um i think that decentralized social is something i don't really understand to be totally honest because it's to your point right like the network effects of social are so important and because we've all and this is actually like i think one of the core issues is like reputation and clout and how you take your accumulated reputation with you as you move from platform to platform um i just invest in a really cool company project that's working on enabling platform-less applications by bringing back the rss feed do you remember the article of course okay and then like all of the platforms basically realized if i don't if i have an rss feed people are not going to be on my platform i don't get their eyeballs and i don't get to monetize these these customers these users so the rss feed right all the major websites all the major like news sites all the major platforms turned off rss and so um the same challenge exists in crypto right like you have all these wallets you have all these sites you have to visit there's no like rss feed for web3 but the ultimate vision i think is we need infrastructure and tooling and developer tooling in particular that will help you pull in all this data and effectively like gather information from a variety of different sources but surface it in any application so effectively you have platform-less applications where you don't require the platform and you don't need to visit the platform the data gets pulled into whatever front end you want to use or build or interact with but i think until we resolve some of the underlying like infrastructure issues around how these apps work it's really difficult to imagine decentralized social because again i think it's very difficult to say to someone who's invested thousands of hours of their life of building up a persona and a following say okay go here and start from zero what we need is something that makes the twitter platform irrelevant and effectively enables us to pull in like discord and twitter and instagram and all of these sort of data points as well as our web 3 data like our web 2 and our web 3 footprints and bring them together and surface them in any application right have you looked at dso i have looked at diesel what do you think of that what is diesel sorry i don't know what it is decentralized social it used to be called bitcloud oh um they changed the name of big cloud the clout yeah so nader al-naji who built um another project before like a stable coin basis that that got shut down um raised like 150 million dollars or something for big cloud for for his last company he like i think he was working at google or something he was working at um he was a quant trader at de shaw okay there you go him and jeff bezos okay raised like 150 130 million dollars first stable coin startup ended up giving back like most of the money started bitcloud as this anonymous decentralized social network but the thing that big clout did that also handshake did right so handshake is a dns protocol so domain name service protocol um basically what they did is on big clout they allowed anyone with a twitter existing twitter profile to claim the equivalent on big cloud right so you wouldn't have the zero start problem and then it enabled people to basically buy creator tokens for anyone on twitter right and twitter was the first platform they sort of linked through to so people can buy melting demires tokens i have not claimed my clout account and i i don't plan to sorry i touched my microphone sorry you're good you're good you're good you're good you're good um but i think the challenge again is like all of the actions on twitter so why would i invest hundreds of hours into building up my big cloud and the idea was if we incentivize people with free money then they'll come and they'll stay i know what happened is people came they claimed their free money they cashed out and then they went right back to twitter shocker it was a brilliant growth loop to be fair like for it was it was brilliant and that it played into the like think boy vc narrative of like everybody tweeting about how amazing it was and you had to tweet to claim it so all of a sudden a bunch of bc's a bunch of people were tweeting about it yeah we have a group chat that a bunch of vc think boys are in but not not bc think boys you guys are think boys what am i we're not think boys we're not big boys there's a bunch of like guys that started companies and things i don't know what i'm doing in it but i'm in this thing and all of them were like so hyped for one week it was like everyone pouring money into bitcloud like we're gonna get rich off big cloud and then i literally didn't do anything because i didn't understand it and a week later big cloud got like rug pulled everyone lost their money on it no well what happened again is like um effectively they were trying to bootstrap a network using greed as the incentive right and actually that's what it works really well about crypto and bitcoin right like the thing that gets people into crypto is not the tech it's greed like let's be very honest right like yes the the tech and the vision and like the narrative is super compelling for a lot of people degree is a big part of it and as they get into it they stay not because of the greed but because of the community and like how fun and wild and cool this alternate reality is right like when you step into crypto twitter yeah you step into like through a portal and you're like in wonderland right or maybe it's a little more dystopian and weird somewhere in between through a mirror and you're like what did i just walk into but it's cool it's exciting it's like exhilarating makes you feel something i think the issue with um like using greed in social applications is what else is there this is actually my big issue with play to earn games like literally play to earn games like axi doesn't need to have anything in the game all they need is just a box that you click thousands of times the box just gets smaller and smaller and yields go down and down and down and down that's what play to earn is right that's what a lot of the d5 stuff is is like a lot of the hopping from like ethereum now people are migrating to solana like the majority of avalanches growth has been driven by people hunting for yield right because they don't give [ __ ] about the platform they don't care about like what it is they're just looking to maximize the roi on the time they spend on these things so it works but there has to be something more there the goal is is that the the greed and people coming in for the money will build community and that the community will be strong enough right and the mythology around it and the narratives and the symbols and like the shared identity will be strong enough to keep people there and the issue with big clout was it just wasn't there i feel like the the point you just made of the greed in my mind it's like gartner hype cycle like you have greed draws a ton of capital flows into this which then the greed collapses because the market will collapse at some point like you'll have a drop but the reality is all that capital flowed in and so then people that are real believers and the tech and the people that are building can use that to build what the future is and then every low ends up higher than the prior level so this perez is at mit wrote a book called um technology revolutions and financial bubbles which is basically about this phenomenon right new technology comes out new thing comes out people pour ton of money into it really excited but the actual product itself right like the ability to deliver real value isn't there so there's all this paper value that gets built then there's a crash there's correction and then the real value gets built a great example of this is chain link right chain link is a project that started in 2015. i knew the founders like we used to go to the bit devs meetups and eat free pizza but projects started didn't really have a clear vision got um really popular and they made a bunch of money and they were able to use the money right to build something really innovative and that's actually useful today but there's sort of this interesting challenge with chicken or eggs like do you start with a capital or do you start with a product and a lot of crypto today uses this model of financial bootstrapping where they use greed as the mechanism right and they have like liquidity mining and air drops and all this other [ __ ] to incentivize people to pay attention but the issue is there's so many things that are doing it that if you're a profit maximizer you're just going to go from thing to thing to thing to thing so at the end of the day really what gets people to stay is the community right and it's the stories the mythology it's the experiences so i think the communities that do best or the projects that do best or the protocols or the ecosystems that do best are those that are able to figure out how to build that community so what advice what advice do you have we have a lot of listeners who are into web three they want to build they want to build something what advice do you have for designing mythology um okay so one thing i've been really fascinated by is the role of historians um not many companies today employ historians but i think every company every project should employ a historian and like a chief storyteller um so i think having someone who is like the spirit animal of your business like a coin share is my business i'm our spirit animal i write our mythology i write our narratives right like it's and you're also my spirit animal for what it's worth so happy to do that no but but it's really important right like someone needs to keep receipts and again like the the people who have power in the present they write the story of the past right it's always in that way now with bitcoin we have the ability to record historical information with fidelity which is like so cool but we don't need to get into that but um yeah i would say like having a storyteller and really thinking about intention i think at the end of the day the other thing is like intention and the energy you create people feel that so i always like to joke that i'm not a venture capitalist i'm a vibe capitalist which sounds a little bit cheeky and like shout out to jeff lewis um at bedrock you know he's a fellow vibe capitalist but i think vibe capitalism like for me when i interact with founders i don't care about your product roadmap the vision is what i want to understand and i understand why you personally are excited to build that vision why you think it needs to exist like vcs do a lot of performance art right or they do this weird like power flex that they're the stage entrepreneurs or they're like oh show me a business plan like calculate your tan i'm like i don't [ __ ] know what their tam is because nobody's ever built this before like what are you doing this is like an academic exercise to see if you know how to use excel it's whack so i think um it's really about like what is the intention what's the vibe and then for me one thing that's really important that may not be important for other people i think having fun is really important and there's like this sort of levity and like lightness that has to be there um so i think remembering like the fun components really important but having a storyteller and really investing in storytelling is important and physical events like bring people together in physical space and see what happens when you create a good container like let the magic happen organically there it's almost like there's i have three things from that one you need like a chief community officer someone like that that really understands community that was my first job in crypto chief narrative officer is the other one somebody that's like in charge of the storytelling in charge of the narrative around it because of how powerful that is it's just like that can be a huge unlock for you if you figure that out no companies in traditional world are thinking about that they're like trying to cobble together actually so i did i went on a little search um herman miller the furniture company has a company historian and internally in their office they have a museum where they gather and collect and archive all of the sketches and like products of the past a lot of design houses will have this but i think tech companies need to have it and communities right like i'd love to see like uh you know and discord a channel that's just like our museum right like what's the cool idea yeah well it's one thing it brings the conversation full circle we can talk sports at the very beginning one thing sports leagues have done incredibly well is the hall of fame like you can go to cooperstown if you're a baseball fan and go experience the history of baseball you can go and get the nfl and get the whole mythology behind this religion that you're buying into you can go like green bay packers stadium has a museum yeah where you can go and experience baseball what i love is they give people like um like honorific titles right like babe ruth like what was he known everyone has like a nickname yeah the babe the baby i don't know like people are known for a thing or they have a nickname um you also have baseball has this really unique thing foul balls no one talks about this foul balls are the most unique thing in baseball because there are hundreds of thousands probably millions at this point of people out there who have a piece of history from the sport that they display and people go catch the foul ball you go with your dad do a game you go with your mom to a game and you have your glove and you catch a foul ball and it's like this i mean i remember when i first caught a foul ball i like still remember the day and it was 25 years ago but that carries with you that history so by the way this is why i think sports teams and sports franchise are great investments because they have intergenerational product market fit so if your grandpa was a patriots fan you're a patriots fan your child is going to be in trouble it is right and so many things in our world are like cults of belief why not money why not communities like it's not a crazy leap to think about all of these different things like quasi religions it's just that we attach religion to like this very structured sort of abrahamic religion that we've had in our world today but so i do want to close out that conversation so the religion of this church that you're talking about building what is the actual um application how are you going to actually do this like is the government going to allow you to go create bitcoin church or whatever it is crypto church and declare it as a tax tax-free entity so the process um there is a process um and actually there's a group of people um out west who created the church of marijuana so they went through the process and like the church or the pasta monster what is that called like pastafarianism like a joke yeti monster or something like that yeah there was like a south park episode about this yeah that i loved and again like think of how scientology started right like around hubbard went to his friend he's a sci-fi writer yeah exactly so shout out tom cruise um so there is a there's a process um so from a like administrative perspective you file something called a 1040 form in the 1040 form there are specific things you have to share um you have to share your organizing documents like the underlying philosophy the the religious texts of your religion right um and then uh yeah from there it's just it's an administrative process like anything else like setting up a 501c3 there's a little bit more leg work involved but so are you doing this yeah i'm pretty interested in tracking this i feel like this is a really interesting thing because it does present a way where people can contribute the wealth creation into a productive set of means because the church will presumably be deploying this into a bunch of job creation a bunch of infrastructure creation interesting things being created cities whatever it might be and you can do it in a tax efficient way where you're not relying on the government to allocate by the way this idea is not unique right like a lot of people are working on different permutations of this but i think again um right we've we've lived for so long with this religion like this thing with no name but we all feel it we share a certain affinity right like when you meet someone you share that affinity where you're like oh this person is like me right because you feel a certain type of affinity because you don't have any strong sort of affinity with any other large organized group but it's never had a name it's never had an identity it's never had like any organizational structure around it so one of the interesting questions and i recently went to this weekend retreat um with like people from the divinity in theology space with technologists with like social activists where we talked about this right we were like okay if we created a new religion what would that look like and one of the questions is would it be like this large hierarchical structure like the one we have today will institutions of the future look like institutions of the past or can we create an open open source blueprint complete with open source money that will allow people to build this at small scale for smaller communities and it's more decentralized it's like a mesh of these little cells that are all slightly different and slightly unique to the people who are parts of those communities and like the regions where they live and their preferences but are sort of unified through the underlying open source infrastructure they use because it's all compatible right so there are these interesting questions around like how we how we organize um but i'm here for it it's fun and i learn by doing i learn by doing that's my job like i literally just do a bunch of weird stuff on the internet you're the best job in the world i love your job yes and no i have bags under my eyes often yeah but that's because you're working on cool [ __ ] and that's a good reason and like what's the most fun for me is when i talk to an entrepreneur and we start working on something and i'm like yes but then add this add this i'll introduce you to this we'll bring in this and then we'll go get this money here and put it in this and then all of a sudden when we work together and like mind meld and share that same wavelength we can take something that was like a 5 out of 10 idea and make it a 10 out of 10. bags under the eyes but prada shoes on the feet yeah this has been amazing um where could people find you i know you're an amazing twitter follower so even if you hate twitter you are a great twitter follower yeah i love twitter i'm just an idiot on twitter i just like tweet random stuff um i'm at melt underscore dem dms are open so happy to chat with people if anyone's working on any of this like happy to to chat um on twitter or just give out my phone number to people as well this is a burner by the way so don't worry you're not gonna bob capitalism yeah vibe capitalism um yeah i'm just here to vibe and then um coinshares.com is our our company um and yeah that's it this was awesome thank you so much thank you so much you're the best awesome blew my mind on a bunch of stuff and i'm looking forward to the future of this bitcoin religion i know are you gonna join the i'm in i think it's super interesting i would contribute a bunch of my capital gains into it i think that's fascinating i had a question actually so you mentioned bitcoin specifically do you think like how are you thinking about other cryptocurrencies versus bitcoin yeah that's a great question um so i'm not a bitcoin maximalist but for me bitcoin is sort of unrivaled and unparalleled um in the pantheon of cryptocurrencies and um it's funny i get a lot of criticism from i get a lot of person from everyone period like being a woman on the internet with strong opinions is everyone's like hey [ __ ] you like cool cool bring it oh it's great come at me i love it i love controversy i love it you're not afraid of it no i love it i'm happy to fight i'll tussle um and i bring receipts check the receipts yeah call me i have cvs they're seats they're long as [ __ ] a bunch of coupon codes shampoo by the way also you said this i love it my memory is very good i keep a long tracker but to me like bitcoin right in the pantheon of all cryptocurrencies what bitcoin has done and what bitcoin does is unique and a lot of it centers around the myth of satoshi the fact that there is no central organizing entity every other protocol has a central organizing entity it has leaders it has rulers it has kings it has monarchs right and they're all men as monarchs bitcoin is the only thing that doesn't have that structure right and proof of work in and of itself is actually i think going to be one of the things that brings humanity into new age of energy production right um because bitcoin is effectively a money battery it enables you to balance like power on the grid and i used to work in energy before i worked in cryptos like brings my two worlds together but i think bitcoin is like if we think about cathedrals right bitcoin is a digital cathedral it has intergenerational product market fit in a way that no other cryptocurrency does because it's made it 12 years it survived all of these assaults and attacks and nobody has been able to co-opt bitcoin yeah right and so i think again um if i want to make money and i'm motivated by like greed and this fun like flywheel bitcoin's not the place to do it i think bitcoin is really like long-term where i want to hold my wealth where i want to hold my information right information about like who owns what like the ethereum network has been rolled back ethereum's not immutable these other chains are not immutable right so i think again when we think about like humanity what we're trying to achieve bitcoin is the only thing today that i know of that is able to give us the security guarantees the settlement guarantees and the info second offset guarantees right from a network perspective from a computational perspective in a way that no other crypto network can so that's why i still spend so much of my time on bitcoin cool i like it yeah so i've got a wrap because i drank three tequilas all right man crazy episode what was your one big takeaway from today um i really like the framework for how she thinks about kind of looking at religion and applying it to crypto communities so um instead of a bible you have a white paper um instead of holidays you have a roadmap instead of rituals you have things like gm and we are gmi um and i think there's a lot you can do if you're trying to create a popular crypto or web3 project just looking at religion as a way to give you some ideas i loved that too i thought it was really interesting and it stretched my mind a little bit thinking about it and like the analog of sapiens which is one of my favorite books which if you haven't read is amazing and tons of good discussion points around it i thought the religion angle is really interesting and then just in terms of like tactical application if you're going to build something in web 3 all of melton's points around having a like real chief community officer and a chief narrative officer were super interesting to me and so just as like a structural framework for building a company and building a business around web3 i thought that was fascinating absolutely so if you're crypto curious this is an amazing episode for you but i will say uh melton does live in the future so i'm sure a lot of people are gonna listen to this and be like no way and there's some people are gonna be like absolutely so i wanna hear from you all like let's let's talk about in the discord and just hear you know do you believe in what she's saying or is this just is this just a pretty future yeah we got to go deeper on it there's so much to talk about here and the future is a little crazy and sometimes it looks completely insane in the present so i would encourage you as you listen to it to stretch your mind a little bit and start thinking about could this be real even if it sounds nuts and let's get into it it's going to be fun we'll go into the community let's start jamming on it and go deeper see you in there 2022 is a great time to take control of your sleep i used to sleep like crap but not anymore ever since i found beam cbd's dream sleep product it's been a

[Music] dude what's going on i'm so excited for uh so excited for this one mailbag episode yeah this is i mean nikita i haven't seen you in in years and i i i follow every tweet you do so it's it's i'm having like a celebrity shock situation no i i'm sorry i'm sorry you've had to read everything i've said uh it must be mentally taxing on you well the funny thing about nikita it so we're in a group chat with nikita you just said you haven't seen him in years which i find so funny because we basically talk every single day in this group chat um i've seen nikita within the last year nikita and i had a big night out in l.a not not too long ago which was a blast but the funniest thing about nikita is that most people have no clue what this man looks like in real life because he is a cartoon avatar [ __ ] poster on twitter i and i like to keep it that way you know i run into people they'll i tell them my name they're like wait a minute i follow you on twitter and uh you know it's uh i still get all the benefits of fame without uh without any recognition smart man be walking around a grocery store no one bothers me not that i'm even at that level or anything maybe someday though maybe someday we'll we're pumped to have you on for at least a little bit of this mailbag episode i am going to be drinking i don't know if you guys are drinking it's probably too early nikita's time maybe not but i'm drinking kentucky owl rye ten year rye this was actually um you know i've been doing these like whiskey rambling threads on sundays i i um i kind of decided that everything had become too performative as i had like scaled on twitter and so i was just like kind of [ __ ] it and i'm just gonna write off the cuff on random stuff and like hot takes and things so i got a little drunk two weekends ago and wrote this thread and people seem to like it like a lot of cool people followed me it got shared by like this famous cricket player that fired up my indian family and so then i decided i was going to do it again and a bunch of people sent me whiskey so i got this great bottle of whiskey sent to me and i did it yesterday again and like some people attacked me for some of the things i said but for the most part it was pretty can i could i comment on your whiskey thread before we you know talk to nikita so please hit me you i read both your threads they're amazing but like if i'm gonna drink a bunch of whiskey and write a thread like it's not gonna be as well crafted as your thread like yours you're even an immaculate threat threat both times so like how well first off two whiskeys not four so that helps it definitely starts to trail off like some of the later tweets even i can see like i made like grammatical errors and things but you also gotta know like my baseline is highly crafted like pure like really immaculate [ __ ] and so that for me was like pushing the boundaries a lot of it but yes i agree with you it still is like in the grand scheme of things it still looks that way probably yeah i would i would agree that the quality has certainly degraded it's gotten nikita level it got to nikita level it wasn't quite on [ __ ] poster level i mean the palpable tension between [ __ ] post twitter and thread twitter right now is you know it you can really feel it like you can cut it with a butter knife for sure yeah we're definitely uh we're we're rivals in the twitter sphere well i like it um so let's dive in 2022 is a great time to take control of your sleep i used to sleep like crap but not anymore ever since i

have a little bit of a list of things we wanted to cover um you want to start with mine or i feel like i've got i've got one to start that i feel like nikita is going to be great for so maybe we can start on my list cool so nikita i mean nikita's background just for anyone that doesn't know and he can talk a little bit more about it as well as he's a founder multi-time founder and other than being an amazing twitter follow he founded and built a business called tbh that was sold to facebook for a bunch of money and then he proceeded to work at facebook heroically for several years as his stock vested out from that original deal he's recently separated from the company and uh on to bigger and better things beyond just [ __ ] posting he is building something new that's going to be cool that was memed to death a few weeks ago on wait can i interrupt you for one one clarifying point so nikita and you agree i think you'll agree with me on this it wasn't as clean as like hey i started a company and it was tvh and i sold it to facebook it it no no it didn't it didn't work that way we built uh we did it for five years we built 15 apps um we were about to shut down we were very close to it and the 15th app went straight to number one in the app store right as we were like basically turning off the lights in the office uh it was our hail mary but at the same time it was sort of a magnum opus of everything we had learned over the years and the moment that it dropped you know we were seeing exponential growth and we it turned into a very competitive bidding process between a bunch of uh you know big names in silicon valley and uh we closed the we got the term sheet within six weeks of launching the app and uh and we sold it was it was kind of like a dream come true situation uh basically like a movie it's kind of a crazy it's so i didn't know that first off so greg i'm glad you paused and asked i didn't know that it was the 15th out of 15 things when i read stories about it when i like looked you up when we first connected it always just it's like the you know the one line click bait of like you know started and sold company for 100 million dollars in a hundred days or something like is the headline that i'll always read which is [ __ ] amazing don't get me wrong super dope it's sort of cooler that this was like your last thing and it was really you know took me 10 years to be an overnight success type situation where you pounded your head into a wall for a long time and then this final thing really worked yeah and i i don't even think we'd be able to pull it off if it wasn't our 15th thing because when when it when it hit we knew exactly what to do we knew exactly how to scale it we knew exactly how to maintain relationships with the press and media um we we knew what we were doing but if if we just struck it on the first try i think it would have crashed and burned really quickly um so i'm actually kind of glad it you know it built character and it also uh made us really hit it out of the park i mean nine million users in i think it was like 90 days it was it was a wild ride that's so insane i love it and now you know now companies come to you to to get advice on those things from the 14 headaches i'm sure just as much as the one success so i mean it's it's it's awesome and and we have you on um for a number of reasons beyond just that one story which is amazing but um i want the first thing on my list greg is i want to talk about facebook and the facebook earnings um i don't know what catastrophe or like uh apocalypse or whatever whatever i'm going to call it so to set the stage on this um facebook announces earnings um last week um and basically plunges like 26 or something like that on the back of it it erased 250 billion dollars of market value in a single day it was the largest single day wipeout of market value in history ever point blank mark zuckerberg lost like 30 billion dollars of net worth in the single day snap got pulled down on the back of it that day only to whipsaw the other way 60 up 60 percent after dropping like 30 on the day of facebook's announcement um just like a totally insane set of events uh i want to talk about it because it's really interesting to think through what the hell was going on uh i am on the record you could check the tapes on this i was on cnbc talking about facebook maybe two months ago when they changed their name to meta saying that basically i thought it was like pr 101 crisis management 101 that they had a fundamental product issue that was going unaddressed and that they were going to be in trouble so they were grabbing attention shifting to the metaverse doing all of those things um they've now come out and said that some of the stuff that apple has done with the att the app tracking transparency is going to cause a 10 billion dollar hit to their business in 2022 there's so many things happening here and nikita having been at facebook is a great person to comment on them so can you just explain a little bit of this position that facebook is in now and and uh where you see it going yeah um so uh to set some context on that market cap drop uh the last record holder for that drop was also facebook uh this is the second time they've set the record um what was the first one's number what was that how much was the first one uh i think i think it was in like the upper like hundreds of million hundreds of billions um but i remember because i worked there when it happened and i remember reading that headline um but you know so i i when i joined facebook um i i never had a real job before and i came in there and i was like blown away this company really knows how to grow products like i look through you know the workplace uh social network which is where all the employees kind of engage and they are treating growth as like an academic discipline and that's what facebook has built is like a machine that can grow products um however the thing that they really struggle with is zero to one creating new products and that's that doesn't only play facebook uh many other companies many most of big tech has not ever built in-house zero to one products that have uh had uh that have broken out um i like the iphone it was truly like a a historical example that that happened but i think if you look across all of big tech you rarely see that happen and at this okay so setting the stage there that they can't build zero to one really that well um they have huge amounts of competition coming in imessage is going after close friends uh in the and that's that's where their high rpe arp use users are the ones that bring in the bulk of the revenue are in the u.s and iphone is eating or imessage is eating their lunch on the content and entertainment side tick tock is just growing like a weed and everybody saw this coming two years ago just based on the growth trajectories and the third kind of terrifying thing is they can't acquire so the regulators uh the ftc uh they they won't re they won't sign off on any sort of large uh acquisition of a user base um so they're losing users um from an engagement from these two other uh competitors at the same time they can't really buy their way out of it like they did with instagram in the past or what's up nikita it's such a fast yeah you know you're you're king for the day you're uh nikita zuckerberg um does you know what do you what do you do do you like break up facebook like what's your plan or did you just go home and cry and just is this you know is it just gonna be you know a zombie company for the for the next 20 years so um it's a tricky situation like i don't think there's an easy answer here there's no silver bullet um you know and people ask like why can't they just start building in-house it's not easy for them to build in-house big tech doesn't do that well um the incentives aren't really aligned to to get employees to take big swings uh you know you might get a a big bonus for making the next instagram but i don't know anyone who'd grind out you know that grind it out for that sort of reward they'd rather just keep it all for themselves and start their own company so you know the environment isn't really conducive to founders they're certainly trying they've created the new product experimentation org uh which i was a part of the creation of that um but it's tough like i had some crazy ideas and i was like i don't know if i could build it in this context um it's so interesting because as investors like all three of us do quite a bit of angel investing or investing and one of the most common questions that new founders get is like oh why won't you know facebook just come and do this or why wouldn't twitter just go and do this and like you'll be dead if one of the big companies just decides they want to do this and then you get the counterpoint to it which is literally that there are so few examples of an incumbent figuring out innovation and being able to go and do something zero to one that it actually makes you feel better about these startups because like a laser focus on a single thing will always outperform these big companies that are like trying to hobble over you know like a big ogre to uh to go and do something and like jankily pull something together within a new market yeah i mean that that's what i was worried as as a founder when i was building social apps i was like i don't want to show it to any facebook employees they might copy it but after being on the inside it takes about a year for of collecting data for them to even think about building something like this or building something they see happening in the market and then it takes three months of like a framing process where you do research you put together slide decks that you send around to executives and then you have another year after that to actually build it and get it to pass all the legal sign-offs so you're looking at almost like oh usually like over two years to respond like i remember i was sounding the alarm bells for clubhouse i was like this this is a new format that's pretty interesting um and you know it took it took some time for people to catch on to it um and that's such gold by the way like for for a startup founder out there to hear that that like the bureaucracy and the absurdity of these big tech companies and the committees and the layers that it has to go through to actually compete against you i mean what a call to arms if you're a startup founder out there worried about starting something because of you know the potential competition from a big tech company it might actually be a good thing for them to even know you exist because then then there's a bigger m a appetite for them to go after it if if facebook could ever acquire things again um yeah that's an interesting point that you raised actually too is like this whole ftc thing has been so confusing to me because you you on one hand have you know government just going after the like big american tech companies and basically just saying that like any acquisition they do is going to come under you know review and then you have tick tock which is chinese owned and de facto controlled by the chinese government by the way and owns the data of literally every single teenager in the united states and we're just going to not say anything about that and everyone like you know trump kind of went on his crusade then there was the whole weird thing where he was going to like say that oracle was going to take over the u.s business of tick tock which was weird and bizarre but we're just not going to talk about tick-tock and the fact that like the chinese government has direct access to the data of millions of teenagers in the u.s but if facebook wants to go acquire some tiny company it's going to get tons of [ __ ] for it yeah and i think the the public thinks that you know facebook doesn't it can't be trusted to to manage sort of the problems that have plagued its platform like misinformation integrity issues but you know one thing that i i one area that i hold like a lot of respect for as a founder who you know is not that excited about working at a place like facebook they have some of the best integrity systems the best spam the best misinformation detection systems out of any probably any company in the world and uh would we really want to entrust a chinese company to to handle sort of those those problems because that's basically the the the message that the ftc is sending is we're gonna uh kind of control the growth of this other company to let this to let ftc to let um tick tock continue to grow so i think it's it's kind of a shame because uh i would i would want those controls to be on our shores uh and they're really not i feel like the better branding play would have been if facebook rebranded to usa instead of meta and it was just like this whole rally around you know almost like how when i think of ford yeah american owned yeah yeah yeah i actually think kind of it's kind of genius i i think that this last earnings call though i think you know there was some you know 4d chess being played to show i mean it took a huge hit to the market cap but i think it showed to the world that this is a competitive market that the anti-trust concerns might be overblown uh you know certainly facebook dominates in a certain age cohorts certain localities but it's getting uh it's it's facing extreme competitive pressures from other areas um so uh but i think highlighting that and making it visible and taking a hit financially might be a short run like a short-term cost for a longer term play it i mean it also showed the craziness of um it's reliant i mean the the the impact that apple's att change has had on facebook's business yeah idea is like crazy i mean the app tracking transparency thing apple basically you know allowing you to opt out of having um apps track your activity which for people that don't understand it basically limits facebook's ability to have highly qualified targeted ads and so that reduces the level of pricing that facebook is able to pass through to advertisers on the platform which is basically what facebook's business is it's an ad business and ben thompson i think talked about it basically this was it was 10 billion dollars that was going to be the impact to facebook in 2022 is what they said on the earnings call which as he pointed out is it's a pricing change because it's the level of price you can charge to the advertisers which is a direct hit to the bottom line of facebook and is a massive proportion of their annual earnings that are actually going to get hit there so the market response actually felt like it made sense i just don't think people i don't think people fully understood how impactful apple's one single change could be to the entire ecosystem that existed out there of all these other players that rely on that tracking mechanism yeah it goes to show that the monopoly might not be facebook it might very well be apple uh the fact that they could just you know hobble a bunch of small businesses overnight with uh by hurting the performance of ads and i think you know a lot of people say oh we're really sticking it to facebook but realistically the people that are impacted the most are are these the owners of small businesses so i i think the with the ftc might be better to realign their whole uh probe against uh yeah the company that controls our phones facebook is just such a fun enemy um i mean even since the early days right like mark zuckerberg has been so fun to hate for all of these you know uh regulators for the government ever since the days of social network when he was kind of like painted as this like weird evil genius villain and i actually don't think any of it is fair um but he was painted that way and that was the image you had of him and the whole thing with the winklevosses and this whole story about zuckerberg and who he was right or wrong it's like been the image that's been painted of him that i think has been implanted into the american mind um and honestly my take on privacy too is like people don't actually really care to the point where they're not really willing to pay extra money to have more privacy um that's like one of my hot takes that exists out there and so i i just think part of it is just imagery and figuring out how to shift that perception again for them because it's i think it's like 10 plus years in the making how it's yeah my here's my take on that my take is a lot of people feel like mark zuckerberg is punchable and if mark zucker okay a couple things actually if mark zuckerberg wasn't the founder and ceo of facebook i don't think the stock would have dropped as you know as much i feel like it's so polarizing because like people have this image of him and they want they want so many people want to see him lose and they see it as one person i don't know how yeah if you know facebook must have like a hundred thousand employees but they you know they see it as one person um and the second thing is if the social network didn't come out i feel like it also wouldn't have you know wouldn't be that polarizing i feel like so many people saw the social network and because of that we have this like image of like sean parker mark zuckerberg the whole like silicon valley it like shaped the whole like generation it shaped our generation of entrepreneurs totally one yeah i i think a lot of this hatred is is totally misplaced i mean uh i i don't think like people think oh it's facebook's trying to make more money off of us at the end of the day like this is this is my kind of uh polarizing opinion uh companies exist for like big tech companies exist for the egos of the founders and at the end of the day he just wants to be liked uh he just wants to build something that helps people i mean he's made enough money so it's not like making another 20 billion dollars is really going to change anything for him so i i think like the public's kind of animosity is a little bit misplaced here uh but yeah i i know if i say that out loud and i am right now i'm going to get [ __ ] on on twitter because everyone that's okay everyone won't be the first or last time all of us get [ __ ] on on twitter i like you guys probably get [ __ ] on on twitter more than i do to date but now i'm starting to come into it now that i've got these like got the drunk threads going so i'm going to join you guys in uh in the getting hate on twitter land um wait before before nikita leaves oh i need to know because you know i bought some shares of facebook literally right before this call that's why i was late i'm sorry um are you call yourself yeah you know this isn't financial advice but like you know are you bullish or bearish on facebook at these current prices i mean they're facing some serious some serious issues here and um i i don't think there's an easy way out i think the metaverse is many years away um at least i i don't see us wearing face computers anytime in the short term um so i you know there has to be some uh hail mary here i think for them to to climb out of this at the same time though like a 16 x p e ratio uh for that amount of talent at that company uh there's there's some value there so um this is not financial advice so wait with you guys so wait are you bullish or bearish i i don't know it's it's i i think they have a [ __ ] bottom line is they have a [ __ ] ton of talent for that uh p e ratio i think it's it's a it's a very good value buy right now but uh where's scott galloway on it i i just don't know i can't see where the route out is right now for them so that's what gives me pause i just follow i go anti-portfolio of turner novak turner shout out banana cap although turner was proven right you tweeted against him nikita on snapchat and then the next day it was up sixty percent uh i made a 500 trade map on that day i saw that nice nice i'm impressed well dude thank you so much for for joining to jam on this one appreciate you and uh look forward to bringing you back on for a proper episode as well yeah thanks for having me uh and uh good luck guys thank you well i wanted to drop my app by the way oh hit us all right so what i'm building is and you can cut me off right there perfect what a legend what a legend what an exit what an exit all right man all right that was fun all right that was really fun i'm glad we brought him on to talk about that i i still i'm not sure whether he's bullish or bearish on facebook but we can take it are you bullish um or bearish on facebook at these levels i'd buy facebook here i i mean i i i'm not i don't buy um individual stocks i've talked to you about this i only buy etfs um like you know market tracking things and i was i've been buying big tech stuff on this on this like drop over the last several weeks i mean there are some names that are just that feel under the surface really undervalued here so dude i'm a buyer what is this 16 p8 pe ratio on facebook that's that's absurdities that's literally absurd but i don't like i don't know what that means bro i'm not a headphone really i know what it means and i get it but it's not like everyone throws these numbers around and they're like oh 16 well like five years ago that was probably high right it's just multiples that expanded so i don't know um but it does just seem like it's not like facebook's not going to be exactly sure so i personally i like betting on mega stuff and things i'm never going to sell i don't trade like i my active strategy in markets is i literally buy with never intending to sell and i intend to take loans against holdings and never sell so that i can not have to pay taxes in the future pro tip um but i don't intend ever sell and i am perfectly happy owning big u.s tech over the next 20 i mean apple included by the way given what they were able to do to this entire market with that one change i love apple couple things what the world runs on whatsapp like literally runs on it um so you know that is really the crown jewel of facebook in my opinion um so big believer in whatsapp even though it's hard to monetize messaging apps so like that's the the counterpoint to what i just said is just like it's just harder to monetize but like who's to say they can turn whatsapp into more of a social network so that's number one number two like i feel like they needed this like compression um and nikita kind of talked about it but like they needed this compression to to basically be an underdog and i feel like i don't know a year two three years from now like i feel like they're gonna they're gonna ship some stuff and and and some of it's gonna work um so i'm i think uh i think the stock will outperform that's that's what i think yeah it's a good bet i think it's a good bet though he pointed out the level of talent there is hard to bet against at these prices so i'm i'm i'm with it i totally get it you want to jump to um want to jump into the next thing i know we've got a handful of other things to get through um you want to hit one from your list you want to do another all i'll uh kick it off so are you familiar with the nouns project the red glasses yeah red glasses blue glasses yellow gusses so basically what it is uh for context is uh if you go to nouns.wtf you can pull it up right now um i am they it's an nft project where they sell these characters they're called nouns and they wear these glasses kind of like what i'm wearing if you know that kind of vibe and every day it's an auction forever and there's a new one every single day and these things go for hundreds of thousands of dollars every single day one per day and um the founding team of which dom who's the co-founder of vine is on the founding team and this you know this guy gremlin who's a well-known nft artist on the founding team these like well-known people don't take a cut of the actual sales because they've raised you know millions of dollars they actually just get i think it's like one in every 10 i think uh of the actual nouns goes to their their wallet and the big innovation around nouns is this thing called cco which is create a common zero which is this idea that um the artwork is in the public domain so even if you sahel you go and buy this like you know 8-bit character with these like blue glasses you actually don't own it um the whole world owns it so i can actually you can go spend 400 000 on this little nouns guy and i can actually go down like right click save as a jpeg go to a screen printer and actually like you know wear you know sell hats jack butcher our friend jack butcher is doing that like i bought last night for 69 obviously a hoodie with the blue nouns glasses um obviously by the way on 69 dollars great and you know a lot of people look at that and they're like wow i'm going to spend 300 000 on this like nft and i don't even own the rights that's crazy um but because it's in the create you know creative commons you know your meme spreads a lot quicker which is the the bet and it's this whole you know it's kind of interesting so oh you got you you want to say something yeah so it's interesting because i've written about this stuff in the past like i've written about disney's ip coming into public domain and how disney will fight to the death to maintain their they've actually changed ip law in the us on like seven or eight occasions to avoid mickey mouse coming into the public domain and yet now you have this company in nouns or entity that is actively leaving things into the public domain immediately um so i'm trying to wrestle you know like the juxtaposition of old world and new world here is very very i think uh while it sounds like cco is just like so simple um and small it's actually such a game changer and i think brands in 2022 or in 2023 you know are going to leverage cco and it's going to be it's going to be huge but what i wanted to talk about now that you you understand a little of the stage in the context of nouns is nouns just published or sorry bud light just partnered with nouns and they released a super bowl commercial uh it's gonna be on the super bowl the super bowl is this sunday uh february whatever sunday is and they just did the release of it and in the bud light commercial there's the the the you know character walks into this like museum and there's this like massive nouns glasses aka nouns are uh mainstream aka nfts are mainstream aka cc0 is mainstream so i have a handful of questions this is a i mean it does seem like a big deal um and i'm not shocked that there is like web 3 influence in super bowl ads by the way just because of how it's captured public attention um but i will say there's a lot of interesting features here that you know just as like a curious observer that i'm looking at number one talk to me about this whole idea of the nouns dow treasury so all of the proceeds if i'm reading it correctly from these auctions or going into this treasury is the treasury what are they using the treasury for and like this partnership with budweiser is it like related to the treasury do you know anything about how they're how they're yeah so nouns the way it works is you buy a noun and if you're lucky enough to spend 300 000 and you get this noun what you get is one vote in the dao and for those of you don't know dow decentralized autonomous organization basically a fancy way of saying it's like a crypto company that's the let's put it that way and they vote on ways to spend that treasury so i actually think that i i i haven't looked into it but i'm pretty sure that they um this bud light deal came from a vote that the community did to uh to get the nouns word out there this is pretty fascinating i'm up i pulled up the bud light um super bowl ad and the the the imagery around it first off it's super cool and it looks like it's going to be a cool ad so i'm excited to actually see it on sunday during the game um but it does feel i mean this public domain thing is what i'm wrestling with and that i think is so interesting because like i've seen nouns the glasses which are very distinct looking once we'll include a we'll include an image or something when we post the episode but um you and i were both in the cryptos project and you owned a you owned a crypto that had nouns glasses and those were considered more rare so is that part of the ip that we're talking about that's in public domain like can other nft projects use nouns glasses or do they have to be related to nouns to use yeah so great question so uh cryptos was a project that was started by gremplin one of the artists of nouns um and [Music] so he went and used you know the nouns glasses and and you know a lot of cryptos have nouns passes that being said there's another project for example called the littles and it's completely unrelated from um cryptos or nouns or any projects to do with that team and a lot of those uh nfts have nouns glasses and they're able to do it because it's cc0 it's completely in the public domain it's okay so here's my take on this um that i'm just formulating while you're explaining all of this to me um this is fascinating because what you have is this collision of old world ip management which is disney and they're the pillar of that and you have disney who has protected with weapons going out and fighting people to the death over their ip over the course of their of their history ever since releasing the steamboat willie mickey mouse back in the early 1900s they have fought and spent millions hundreds of millions of dollars to fight u.s copyright trademark regulations in order to keep their ip out of public domain now you have these new world companies and entities that are actually doing the exact opposite they want their content and their ip in the public domain why because as we talked about with billy the founder of dogecoin a few weeks ago memes control the universe he who controls the memes controls the world and that is such a fascinating shift because how do you drive enterprise value in this day and age is it now that you drive it via virality and memes maybe and it's a really interesting live experiment in the laboratory to see whether it works i actually don't know the answer of whether it's going to work or not but it's a pretty fascinating case study to see the collision of the two worlds honestly mickey mouse is actually coming up into public domain apparently i think in in 18 months or so um or at the end of 2023 um so it's interesting to see whether that world will prevail or whether this new world that's being created by things like nouns uh will be the one that prevails and that will ultimately generate the most value going yeah i think uh to me it's very clear who's gonna win that battle and you know right i think uh you know here's the thesis of cc of cc0 the thesis is that if you see i'll call it actually i'll call it the wordle thesis you know that game that you've been seeing on twitter and places like that like you play that game or you'll see that game so often that you might play it and it might be a part of your you know your ritual and your habit your morning coffee the same thing is true with nouns glasses you might see nouns glasses you know on a billboard you might see it on your friend's profile picture you might see it on a super bowl ad you might see it in a coffee mug you might see it in a you know you go into a store and they're selling nouns gears and that might make you want to you know buy an nft of downs or you know maybe they make games in the future and you want to buy that game or access that game so the thesis is the more touch points that you have of ip the more likely you are assuming it's good ip the more likely you are to be connected to that ip the more likely you are to buy products and services the more likely you are to join that community et cetera et cetera yeah it's really interesting because to me it's a question of like indirect and direct value attribution um traditional companies rely on direct value attribution if someone is out there producing t-shirts with mickey mouse on it um and disney isn't earning the money from that their traditional mindset is that's bad for me that's money that i should have been earning they should have been buying a disney t-shirt that had that printed and i just lost money a new way of thinking about that would be that is a great thing because now there are more people that are out there wearing mickey mouse shirts that are then thinking about mickey mouse because everyone that sees them sees it and might feel a connection to that piece of ip or might know what that is and then we'll rise the tide overall that will allow me to earn more money in the long term um and so that that's where my head goes to on it is like i actually don't know it's a math question to me of which model works and which one wins in the market in the long term because if the market determines that this new way works which is let everyone use it share it expand upon it build it in different ways use it like lego blocks to create new things my gut tells me that model actually works better uh in the long run because more cool things get created with it in this like weird laboratory that we're building up and i feel like the model of i create ip and i need to protect my ip is very much coming from a place of fear you're leading with fear and it's you know versus this new world that we're entering which is like actually i'm not fearful at all i'm gonna go and like open source basically my ip and i'm so confident that the experience that you know the core experience that i've created is so compelling that the more touch points the better so for disney um and actually i was at disney world in orlando um this past weekend that place isn't cheap um no i think it is not cheap um you know it's you know if you're going as ticket prices have gone way more than inflation over the course of history i i researched this recently for a piece that i wrote it's wild like you can easily spend you know you can either you can go to aspen or you can go to orlando basically um that's the vibe and and but it's a fantastic experience um and i recommend people do it especially product product people this is a side note product people like go to disney world and just see how much you know attention to detail uh you know the roads the sounds the smells the whole thing is immaculate but the point is it's super expensive and they're making high margin so be calm so disney be confident yeah it's um the analog to it that keeps coming to mind for me is this whole built-in public movement um i feel like 10 years ago it was like blasphemy to tell a founder that they should talk about what they're doing and their numbers or their metrics or like product releases whatever and now you see founders tweeting out their arr every month um products they're working on things they're growing our friend josh fabian at medify he literally like he sends out his investor updates publicly every month and that i mean ten years ago that's literal blasphemy because you'd just be terrified that some competitor would come steal it um but it's interesting it's all part of the same like open movement within the digital world i actually i i don't know i don't know my gut tells me that more open leads to more memes which will continue to drive growth of the ecosystem and i think that that will win in the long run um but i'm curious i'm really really curious to see i love this one this was a great topic i'm glad you're what do you got um anthony lewandowski do you know who that is i do but tell uh the listeners who that is i i love this [ __ ] man anthony lewandowski i hope i'm pronouncing that right anthony lewandowski was a or is a self-driving car engineer founder entrepreneur um most people would know him for the fact that he ran google's self-driving car business which became called waymo for a long time left in 2016 and started this business called auto that was doing self-driving trucks auto was acquired by uber shortly after founding and google did not like that that someone that was recently at google started a different business got acquired by uber who had um aspirations to build a large self-driving car business given its given its business model it turned into a massive lawsuit criminal investigation into lewandowski um 33 counts i believe he was charged with trade secret theft all of these scary things pled guilty to one count and was sentenced to 18 months in prison for for that charge but was then pardoned by our former president donald trump and ended up getting getting out of it anthony lewandowski is back in the public sphere he started a business i think it's called pronto ai which is also self-driving vehicles um but most interestingly he is now starting something um called pollen mobile which i saw in the news recently there was a techcrunch article about it which is basically a peer-to-peer open source wireless network and i want to talk about it because i think it's pretty fascinating um basically what they're doing is a it's crypto enabled and it is um something that they started because the cars that he was building at pronto ai actually needed good wireless mobile connectivity and so what they found was that it was hard to find in the bay area they were having issues with it so paul and mobile is um a system that creates incentives via cryptocurrency called pollen tokens um for people to put up basically little mini cell towers that are going to create wireless connectivity around the area so you go and spend money up front to buy um these systems i think they're calling them something funny like sparrows or hummingbirds or bees or some something like that there's some kitchen name to go along with pollen and you put one of these up you pay about you know 10 000 bucks or something to set one of these up and you get incentivized for providing connectivity to the network via pollen tokens which then provide the system with capacity people use it the tokens become more valuable as people are trading in them etc um i think it's pretty fascinating helium is the other one that i've seen doing this that was doing the like wi-fi connectivity i'm curious for your takes on it yeah my take is anywhere where there's incentives human incentives crypto can play a role there it's a really great way to incentivize people to do stuff so what i like about this idea is it feels very natural to crypto um so it makes a lot of sense to me i think it's a great idea yeah first off what you're a design geek website is one of the most beautiful websites i've seen pollen mobile dot io is the website p-o-l-l-e-n-mobile dot io website is gorgeous um and it lays out the whole thing the names they're calling them hummingbirds bumblebees and flowers which like we're gonna have to talk to them about the naming because that's that's a lot um but i do think it's really interesting like this whole idea of incentivizing people to create um these kind of decentralized pillars that create capacity for a network it's it's a pretty interesting use case helium has obviously been quite successful with um with what they've done on the wi-fi side but i thought this was kind of a neat um a neat angle i was actually thinking about i'm not in the bay area they're launching in the bay area but i was thinking about going and buying one of these things and just participating in it to learn because i find it to be a pretty interesting project yeah this website is gorgeous what i do like about this website there's there's something i like about it something i don't like about it what i like about it is you know you scroll down a little bit and says mind crypto from your phone and i think like that concept is just really compelling like i feel like you know a lot of crypto projects um [Music] and late checkout our firm is involved in a bunch where we'll see like it's basically just like too complicated like just like get it down to like five words um that anyone you know it's the feynman technique so exactly five exactly so i love that very you know that's cool what i don't like about it and it's the opposite of explaining like i'm five is i'm going you know i i went to like the how it works section i think um and it basically they have a bunch of uh kind of words that are here let me pull it up like earn bumblebees earn flowers earn hummingbirds it's like yeah no no go back to earning crypto from your phone you know yeah yeah they're definitely going pretty far with the whole pollen analogy a little further than i think but the concept itself people hate their wireless networks like people hate their phone companies nobody likes it and so the idea of like the centralized phone companies and in these little pockets you could create a decentralized version where basically if you're using the network you pay and pollen tokens and the providers of the capacity get paid in pollen tokens and pollen tokens appreciate it as people speculate in them or as people buy them to invest in them to potentially use later et cetera it's sort of a little interesting microcosm experiment helium i think andreessen horowitz backed and several others there's there's something interesting here i and i don't know anything about anthony lewandowski i just thought it was fascinating that he was back in the news because i remember reading all about him when he had the whole self-driving car thing happen so anyway i think this is an interesting one to follow um i'm personally going to poke around a bit if i was in the bay area i really do think i would buy one of these little systems because i think it's fascinating my advice for him is find a new name like uh the web the website paulinmobile.io like i feel like what he needs to do and the team needs to do is like generate a lot of credibility and like maybe there's a uh like an old telecommunication darling company that he can go and buy the name the rights for um that's like shut down or in a brand that's like shut down by the name and then you know you know who did this actually but like bad example is tai lopez so he bought uh radio shack i don't know if you saw that oh yeah i remember that i didn't see that so tai lopez you know famous youtuber has been buying up old brands and love him or hate him he's done a good job at buying a lot of these brands and he's turned radio shack into a uniswap competitor which is a uniswap for those who don't know is basically you know a crypto exchange competitor decentralized crypto exchange um but you'll go to radio shack because you're like i remember radio shack i have good you know yeah and i think radio shack correct me if i'm wrong but i think radio shack is one of those places that like people remember a distinct smell from radio shacks across the world i know i talked about smells with disney world um but it matters because it triggers your memory yeah yeah i mean i just don't know what he wants you know like the paul and mobile thing is it really going to be a core business or is it just that it's a spin-off you know they needed it for um for for the pronto ai thing like i saw a quote in one of the articles he said the reason why we did this is simple we needed reliable affordable mobile connectivity for our avs our autonomous vehicles and we couldn't find it so we built our own and realized it could be something others want necessity is the mother of invention so there's a couple lessons in there i mean i think first off kind of cool that he's just an enterprising founder and they needed something that was functioning for their actual core startup and they went and built something else that's functioning that other people might want that's pretty cool um and the whole concept of necessity is the [ __ ] i really agree i really like that it's the classic slack story i'm sure you know that story where so uh stuart butterfield founder slax you know started a gaming company called glitch raised a bunch of money for it wasn't going so well um but he had built uh slack like the chat up as a um way to communicate with his team members and you know pivoted it to slack um yeah from this game to slack and you know to your point around necessities the mother of all inventions they built it because they're just like it's too hard to collaborate and connect what a amazing pivot story i don't know how i didn't know that story but that's awesome also a canadian founder amazing amazing very cool um all right we've got a few minutes left what else do you have on your list i have one more but we can save it for another time what do you have no go go for it okay all right mine mine is web 2 and web 3 so i think you'll like it too um spotify uh a lot in the news recently for a variety of reasons i want to talk more about the creator side of spotify and how musicians are or are not earning money on the platform there was this awesome piece that triggered me thinking about this in the hustle i think it was where they talked about spotify's economic model and broke it down i've personally been fascinated by the music industry for a long time more recently i've become really fascinated by it because i started seeing this abundance of web 3 music plays which i'm sure you have i know you have a bunch of friends that are investing in the space you're investing in the space i've just seen more and more companies that are trying to disrupt that landscape and the music landscape is interesting and ripe for disruption for the exact reason that i want to talk about which is you have artists on one side that are creating the content creating the music you have consumers who love it and are you know placing value on it and really embracing it and then you have all this rent being collected in the middle and basically what's happened historically within the music industry is artists have actually received very little of the value they were creating for the consumers and if you break it down at its highest level i'm not like you know a fully web 3 red pilled person but the highest level of this is web 3 enables you to create a system where you can kind of cut out this middle layer of rent collection and aggregation and that the people on the two ends the artists and the consumers can get more of the value that they create within this ecosystem and artists in this case will be able to actually capture more of the value that they create for the consumers on the other end and the spotify example was so uh pronounced around it that i thought it was worth talking about which you know is basically um the numbers were just striking to me so recorded music revenues hit a high of 22.7 billion dollars in 1999 from then until 2014 they dropped all the way to 7.3 billion dollars basically fell off a cliff and that was with the rise of these new technologies that completely changed how artists were able to generate revenues spotify is the elephant in the room in this space in music streaming i think 30 of all streaming subscribers are spotify subscribers and basically they have a model for artists that works something like and it's a little more complicated than this but basically something like artists get this negotiated royalty rate on the overall spotify revenues and then an individual artist gets basically their percentage of the overall listens on the platform times that pool um only two percent of spotify artists are earning more than one thousand dollars a year and one tenth of one percent point one percent are earning over a hundred k per year um when you look at spotify relative to other music streaming platforms they are way lower than others way lower than tidal and some of the other players in terms of the average payout per 1000 streams for the artists so my question to you this was all really striking to me my question to you is can they sustain this as a platform and is something really broken here that needs to get fixed can they sustain this no they cannot sustain this i think the music the digital music experience is gonna look really different in five years than it does today when people talk about web3 [Music] they often talk about removing the middleman what they sometimes don't talk about is deepening the relationship between two parties which i think what you know we talked about incentives incentivization um in pollen it's it's a very similar thing so for example um there's this like band i like rex orange county um and you know i follow their youtube i follow their instagram i follow um or you know i follow i obviously listen to his music on spotify like i put in my calendar that on may 6 or whatever he's coming to miami and i want to go there and i buy a ticket and i'm just looking for ways to deepen my relationship and i can't i'm i'm giving him you know a fraction of a penny for every whatever 100 plays or whatever it is um so i think one thing that's gonna happen is artists big small medium are gonna have new tools to deepen their relationship sell more things with you know their true hundred thousand ten thousand hundred thousand fans so what's the right analog for this like i'm thinking naturally in terms of consumer businesses so um let's play let's play this out so you have um companies historically brands and uh they used to like you know try to have retail stores and they would sell through department stores and retail stores and they would try to access customers amazon comes along and is the elephant in the room and if you want to access the hundreds of millions of customers that go to amazon every day you have to sell through amazon but amazon owns all your data amazon owns your customers you don't own that customer and they're going to take a rent charge on it via their logistics fulfillment via their advertising everything you don't own that customer and now we're in a world where that amazon model which a lot of brands are still taking advantage of co-exists with brands increasingly finding ways to engage in an immersive experience directly with their customers and whether that's via direct to consumer sales whether that's by a small footprint retail whether that's via more immersive digital experiences nfts things of that sort they've found a way to sort of co-exist where those brands still sell through amazon for the most part because it's hard to turn down that massive pool of customers that they have but they've also done a great job of taking their the best brands have done a great job of taking their super fans these people that absolutely love them that would buy anything from them and turning them into direct customers where they can create more curated and beautiful amazing experiences with them i'm thinking of that as the likely outcome for where the music space heads which is spotify continues to exist because it will still have access to this massive pool of customers and massive pool of listeners but there will be more and more new platforms new companies new infrastructure rails that enable artists to engage in immersive experiences and deeper experiences with their listeners what do you think about i mean [Music] it's wild that is 2022 and the only way i could engage with the artists i love is buying tickets to a physical event buying a t-shirt or listening to the music where they don't get paid that much like there's just music is such a you know huge part of so many of our lives that like we are looking for ways to to you know it's a lifestyle right like it's literally a lifestyle some you know think of like um you know fish we've we've talked about fish the band um you know that is literally a lifestyle um and i think that what does the future of music look like i think like it looks a lot more like fish than it does how it is today and i think there's new ways to [Music] give people ownership in the upside of some of these artists i think um [Music] there's more intimate spaces for them to coordinate and and have fun and do things together you know and i think that spotify is gonna look just very like you know in five years from now we're gonna spotify it and and and just be like i i can't even believe that all you can do is like press a button and listen to it yeah it's kind of an interesting i completely agree with you it's it's sort of an interesting um example of why i think and i think you would agree with me web 2 and web 3 is actually not the dichotomy that some people want to paint it's actually that the two will continue to coexist and that you know the rise of any web 3 platforms businesses companies actually does not imply the demise of the web 2 versions or the web 2 ecosystem around that same space and i think that in the case of music that's likely the outcome is that the web 2 spotify will continue to exist and thrive within certain sub-segments but that the web 3 alternatives and web 3 platforms that rise within the music space will rise and co-exist alongside and probably in some sort of violent synergistic environment actually in the same way that these new direct-to-consumer immersive experiences have risen alongside the amazon of the world so that's that's where my head is at personally i mean i agree man i agree i think uh if you're it feels very much like you know the last 10 years if you were a creator it just became more easy and easy to monetize and there's just been a lot of opportunities for creators the same thing is going to happen with musicians there's going to be more and more opportunities to monetize and i'm not saying that spotify like there's going to be this like web3 version of spotify that's going to come out i don't think that's the case i think that um like the future of the consumption experience and the future of the creator and or the musician and uh you know publisher relationship is is gonna change and some of it is gonna you know borrow elements of web 3 and some of it's going to borrow elements from web too and it's going to be this beautiful uh hodgepodge because one thing's for certain is that i think you and i know and everyone knows everyone knows that like uh you know the music industry in lots of ways is broken um and there's there's plenty of ways to uh there's plenty of obvious ways to fix it yeah well i know we're up against time this was [ __ ] awesome by the way i enjoyed doing this mailbag we should start doing this more frequently uh i feel like every week we end up talking about a bunch of this stuff offline and we should take it online because it's a lot of fun we can get in some cool guests to jam on the different things that are very topical and happening in tech or business or whatever the space is i think it'll be a blast to do i'm also now two and a half whiskeys deep and so i feel like it's probably time for me to sign off before i say or stupid time for a threat two and a half whiskey's deep [Laughter] sunday nights i honestly i had a bunch of whiskey companies reach out to me wanting to sponsor two whiskey's deep threads um i i wonder how many bottles of this kentucky out because i took a picture of it at the end of the thread and shared it as like what i was drinking i wonder how many bottles of it i sold um because they're pretty expensive bottles i wonder if i sold like a chunk i mean two whiskey's deep has like a pretty good ring to it too like you should register that it could be a podcast register register that domain if you haven't already two whiskey's deep dot e yeah i feel like i actually should i hadn't thought about it until just now i'm looking at the numbers on that tweet like i took a picture of of the um the bottle of this kentucky owl rye that i showed you earlier which is absolutely [ __ ] delicious by the way and i don't condone drinking underage or like in excess by the way i'm at home i'm not driving anywhere but um it's [ __ ] delicious uh and that tweet at the very end of the thread had five retweets and 329 likes it did uh pulling up the numbers seventy seven thousand two hundred fifty three impressions um that has to be worth a decent amount to the brand oh yeah that's huge i mean dude that's huge like i mean seven i don't know what it costs i don't know advertising well enough but those that number of impressions has to be a chunk of change i mean i love it i think uh you know i'm going to pull i'm going to pull up two whiskeys deep should i do the number there's also the question of um there's also the question of do you do twowhiskeysdeep.com is available free yeah i mean i can basically show mean right now for the price of less than a whiskey you can get the domains you might as well ah man interesting this is interesting um i might have to do this next time you see me i might be the proud owner of two whiskiesdeep.com hopefully someone doesn't beat me to the punch by the way there's a there's a newsletter that i subscribe to and my friend phil toronto uh he got me onto it it's called ungrabbed ungrab.com have you heard about this basically they send you an email this isn't sponsored or anything i just like like it and i always open it um it's two curated domains center inbox daily so they go and like buy domains that like sound good and for like between you know 90 and 200 bucks are basically like not expensive so like i just bought um you know colored pencil or was it no pencil pencil case dot co and and i just like i don't know i mean maybe an edit are domains an asset class that we should be trading like can you make money is there a liquid platform for asset like for domain names like people that squat on domains is there an actual liquid platform that exists to trade those domains and make money off of them there's marketplaces so like godaddy etc have marketplaces where you can list it and sell it does it feel like super old school and like very like ebay-esque yeah is there an opportunity to build like the micro acquire but for domains 100 yeah that seems like a cool opportunity i kind of want to poke around on that we should come back and i want to talk about that more on the next one um i want to poke around a little bit on that because i've seen all these people squatting on domains or squatting on ens and it seems like there's an opportunity around that yeah okay let's talk about it next time i gotta run all right yeah me too all right cheers over and out are you and your team

[Music] on the support thing it's a it's it's a fascinating thing because you know in in in product organizations and product companies you can kind of look at support two ways you can say well support is effectively um uh subsidizing a deficiency in the product that the product is not good enough so you need support we never really looked at it that way um even from a very early stage we always you know focused on having someone that you can talk to 24 7 even if it's not a technical support call um one of the things we we often do shopify just using slack is we'll post a lot of um recordings message um uh phone calls uh with permission for merchants of a particular call and a support person may say uh sport advisor may say hey there's a really cool call and posted to the whole company we'll listen to it together or to town hall we do everything every thursday we'll listen to support calls and what you notice is that often what people need is not necessarily technical support where they're trying to you know use an api or they're trying to integrate some sort of third-party erp system most of it is just like business coaching it's someone who's on the other line that says yeah you know i see you you've had a couple sales um hey it looks like you know you're getting great traffic from instagram or from pinterest or from you know some other uh some other site have you thought about activating the pinterest channel the instagram channel the tick tock channel so support is is often i think looked at technology companies and software companies as this technology support but rather when you're talking to entrepreneurs in many cases first-time entrepreneurs often what they need is they just need a voice in the other end to give them you know to tell them to keep going to give them some tips about maybe something they haven't thought about yet and that's a huge part of our business um and even today uh you know there are there are brands that started on shopify around around their mom's kitchen table that are now multi-billion dollar companies um who i still speak to every week or two ben francis who's ceo and founder of gymshark is someone that i've known pretty much from day one when he was a pizza delivery boy uh in london and starting to do jim shark on the side to now where i think jim shark is probably one of the biggest rivals of nike if you can you know if you can believe sip a cup of that never let the world be

you won't regret it so the person i want to talk about the story i want to talk about is morris chang and you've probably never heard of morris chang because you're probably like most people and he's a relatively unknown figure although arguably if not the most impactful figure one of the most impactful figures in the history of technology which is a crazy thing to say i know but let me explain so morris chang is the founder of a business called taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company tsmc it is based in taiwan as you'd imagine and it is probably the most geopolitically and potentially economically important company in the world today morris chang is a fascinating human being and his life and story is extremely inspiring as well as being really impactful so he was born in china fled the country uh during the uh civil war that occurred i think like 1948 fled the country went to hong kong ended up getting accepted to harvard came over to the u.s to go to harvard left harvard to go to mit did his degree there and basically was off to the races on this like amazing career extremely intelligent did really well ended up joining texas instruments which you might know is like a large american semiconductor company and one of the first big semiconductor companies back in the day semiconductors if you're not aware of what they are they're like computer chips right it's the things that power all of our technology um over time they've gotten more and more powerful at this accelerating rate moore's law is the thing people talk about there basically that semiconductors double in terms of their capacity on array on regular intervals so morris chang is rising through the ranks at this company he's become a senior executive doing extremely well and then suddenly he's like 50 years old 52 years old i think to be precise and he basically gets put out to pasture um in his own words i think he says that in his biography um you know 52 years old he's running one of the biggest divisions and kind of gets transferred and it's very clear to him that they're putting him out to pasture he's no longer in charge of the most important stuff um and in hindsight i think a lot of people have pointed to potential racism you know we're talking about something in uh i don't know what years this is like in 1970s maybe or sorry 1983 um so maybe there was a you know some racism involved chinese man rising through the ranks of this american company um so he leaves taiwan comes along and basically offers to have him come back and lead their semiconductor manufacturing industry they want to promote it it's clear that it's going to be a huge part of the future as technology develops so he gets this invite and he has this realization which i think is going to be the thing that connects to all of this future technology and shopify which is semiconductors had always been an industry where you had to both design and manufacture in the same place and the manufacturing part of that was extraordinarily expensive like billions and billions of dollars to build these facilities and what he realized was a lot of innovative design thinkers were not actually being unlocked or able to do their best work because it cost so much money to start up a manufacturing facility so you had all these great people that were basically languishing and the whole industry wasn't progressing in the way it could because they couldn't actually go and start a manufacturing plant it was too expensive so his idea and what he did was he started tsmc which was the first ever pure manufacturing they call it fabulous facility where it was entirely about manufacturing and basically they would rent out their manufacturing capacity to amazing designers and so now if you were an incredible semiconductor designer chip designer you could go create all of these innovative designs and go and contract with this company tsmc to build them and what this has done is created this unbelievable industry and this incredible amount of innovation over the 20 30 years since he's i guess it's 40 years now since he started it that has allowed basically technology to continue to flourish and progress at this insane pace so what are my thoughts is that the yeah well let's start there because there's so many connections to broader technology that i want to talk about but it's a really interesting case study so let's start there so when i hear that story and the connection to shopify um what i love about it is okay what i like about shopify is that it's a business in a box and you know if you're creative and you're passionate about something to your point like you probably just want to focus on if it's making t-shirts just focus on like designing cool t-shirts and then have everything else you know managed uh and outsourced um so i think like that's what i love about shopify they have like an app store there's like fulfillment you can do there's just like everything you can do you're seeing this also with no code like now of a sudden and we've talked about no code before but like now all of a sudden like you can just um you know outsource so much via no code and just sort of put these building blocks together so what's exciting if you're a creator and you have startup ideas is it's pretty easy to get started and at least build an mvp yeah so you're hitting on something that's a really interesting framework which is um these companies like shopify like tsmc um like amazon web services who have basically done all of the really heavy lifting the really expensive the heavy lifting uh the capacity build out servers in the case of aws um that now enable creatives and idea people to go build on the back and just rent that capacity out rather than having to build it it used to be that if you had one of these ideas like if you with shopify as an example if you wanted to start an e-commerce store that was really hard to do there was nothing there was no software there was nothing you could go and just get it started up now because of what shopify's built you can go and just rent their box in order to go start your website you and i could start an e-commerce brand by tonight if we wanted to start that today and we could contract out manufacturing of product we could use the shopify system to find the drop shippers to do all of that it's really amazing and it all exists there it's the same thing as what tsmc did for semiconductor industry and for the broader technology industry because suddenly this massive ecosystem of designers was able to innovate and was able to sit around and just think about designing the most innovative chips because they knew they could rent capacity from tsmc amazon web services another example of that any new builder doesn't have to think about going and buying and building servers to go sit at their technology company you can just rent that capacity from aws who has put in the dirty work and gone and built all of that capacity out the crazy high upfront fixed costs that are associated with that they can take and spread across all of these customers that now come to them yeah one of the things that is pretty cool if you're a builder now in this whole new world is also the velocity of experiments that you can do so um you know you could theoretically be launching a startup every single week put it out there see if it resonates if it strikes a chord with people and just kill things really quickly i think that's why you're seeing the rise of so many product studios and holding companies um we were just texting before this about cody sanchez she is like a holding company and she's like spitting up stuff and buying stuff they check out my company as a holding company and we're constantly doing experiments to see what strikes a chord my prediction is there's going to be a ton more product studios a ton more holding companies because uh you know it's just it's easier to get these experiments out the door and as creators we just have so much less to worry about um which is which is pretty cool the cost of failure has never been lower yeah and that that's how i think of it because of all of these things because of no code because of these capacity providers like an aws a tsmc a shopify you can go rent capacity so cheap so quickly because of no code low code you can go build things out without hiring a bunch of developer talent you can test ideas the cost of testing a minimum viable product minimum viable community to connect to the point that we brought up with alexis ohanian a few weeks ago you can connect those two and get something off the ground so quickly that the cost of trying something is very very low now and so to your point on product studios i think when i come to these things i think about what is scarce and it used to be that capital was scarce to go start these things because it was so expensive now capitals abundant the capacity is abundant you can go and try all these things all the technology to try them is abundant what's scarce then in my mind is execution you know it's action bias it's like people that are actually willing to go and test their ideas and go try new things and dive in on it that's what's scarce is the actual bias for execution bias for action i'm sure you have friends who text you and you're like hey i have this startup idea what do you think right and i get those texts all the time and i like now i'm kind of like well cool idea but like why don't you just go build it like go build something to test this hypothesis you know i'm getting tired of like what do you think this idea what do you think this idea because like if it's going to take you seven days 14 days 24 hours 48 hours to go and actually test this core hypothesis like i'd much rather you send me hey here's this landing page you know i posted it on twitter i got 150 email signups um here's what i learned what do you think of that versus like here's an idea i totally agree and you we all have friends that are like that too that are you know you ha you have kind of a split of friends or people in your network the people that are like ideas and nothing ever really comes of it and you're like talking about ideas which is also fine actually people that like talking about ideas i think that's great but then there's these people that we all have in our lives who are just biased for action types and those people are amazing to be around i mean we have a friend um that we're in a group chat with nick huber who controversial guy you know people uh say what they want about him with different things he does and says uh but the guy has a real bias for action and when he says he's going to do something or when he has some idea he somehow just finds a way to roll it out very quickly and test it and see if there's a market for it and it's something to look up to and aspire to i think because those people end up being winners i have a close friend this guy barrett o'neill who you will surely hear more from and i have a small holding company with him that we're working on a handful of different sas things that we've rolled out on the side don't really publicize it we're starting to do more build in public around it and he's one of those guys that the reason i wanted to partner with him on it is literally because he would come with an idea we would jam on it and a week later he'd be like oh i had my developer team uh pulled together this like quick mock-up of it what do you think how does this work like what's the click flow and it was literally seven days after we had come up with the idea and he had this prototype of it wanted to like test it with 10 customers and when you're like that and you have that kind of bias for action and you leverage all of the things that we have at our you know at our disposal today relative to 20 years ago people would have killed for that stuff you realize that today is literally the best time in history to be an entrepreneur and to be someone that has a bias for action i will say on the bias for action piece i do know a lot of people who are bias for action so they put out a ton of experiments every week month whatever but then they give up too easily on some of these experiments so that's i think we're gonna encounter that a lot in like 22 and 23. yeah which is like they're just gonna there's gonna be graveyards of these experiments and i think it's really important to like if you're a builder and you're you're putting experiments out you're not you're also like gaining the key insights you're writing down the key insights um and you're iterating you know around a problem and you're not just you know jumping around kind of aimlessly just to put out experiments for the sake of putting out experiments yeah well it's a good it's a good point because i think what you're getting at is that there's more scarcity of bias for action is real but there's also a scarcity of things like kind of grit tenacity like the ability to follow through on things um and then like intellectual curiosity i still think is going to be kind of the razor's edge between success and failure because in a world where um you know kind of compute capacity is limitless eventually intellectual curiosity and the willingness to go down those rabbit holes and figure out what it is that needs to be built in the first place is always going to be in short supply um so i mean i i totally agree with you i think it'll be really interesting to see um i mean with things like micro acquire and you know our friend gazdecki that's building that it's pretty cool because there's a real pathway for people to build something small scale it up stick with it a little bit and now there's liquidity on those type of businesses and there's a real marketplace being built around it so i think you're going to see this whole new generation of entrepreneurs like micro entrepreneurs that are going and doing these things to your point on product studios and it's super fun like the number one you know people ask me all the time like why why do i love doing a holding company in a studio and an agency and a fund and all these things and all these experiments the number one reason selfishly is that it's a lot of fun it's really fun to be a creative person and to work on multiple ideas multiple experiments iterate it iterate versus like you know you're working on a small feature of like a large thing and you're just it's just you know it's really fun to do zero to one concept building and experiments right now yeah and you can be your own boss doing that you don't have to go work for someone you can go build things find liquidity find cash flows etc pretty cool and ties so well to our conversation with our guest harley who is an amazing figure also has one of the best zoom setups i've ever seen in my life so i'm personally excited to get shown up here and jam on all of this stuff i mean what they are doing to foster the entrepreneurial ecosystem and increase the gdp of the internet i know that stripes thing but shopify i would argue actually has just as much of a claim to it they call it arming the rebels i suppose which i absolutely love and i'm going to ask harley about it but let's bring him in and let's go deeper on this stuff i really want to hear more about his predictions for the future what's working for them what's not um and just go deeper on it sounds good man i should probably look it up uh like like history of sm7b welcome in man uh 1973. okay good 1970. yeah the sm7 was introduced in 1973 and there were some revisions but effectively uh the the revision was introduced in 1999 um where there was an additional larger windscreen built in but yeah the mic if you look at the one from 1973 it's almost exactly the one we're using right now so you're telling me that our mics are more retro than greg's greg looks like he's from the future which i think is probably true because every time we get on these with greg i crack up seeing him i think he looks like he's getting into some like ready player one mode or something like that to go into the metaverse i mean it's nerdy it's nerdy it's a gaming headset it's perfect yeah yeah i i it's like the i think you know you kind of have the all-in podcast you know kind of set up there i think they all use that on that podcast yeah it's not below your line greg that's good not going there too soon i'm not going there greg and i have known each other you know this for a long long time and i know we'll talk a bit about montreal and sort of um why i think montreal's such a ridiculously inspiring place to grow up and become an entrepreneur um but greg and i've mentioned for a very long time and and it's uh i i you know him and i are peers so it's kind of weird to say this but i am uh incredibly blown away and frankly um i i just very impressed and very proud of his incredible success can you see me blushing right now no i don't want to do the whole like patronizing right i think you and i are almost the same age but i am i'm you know greg has always been someone that has great talent so it's super cool to see it i i i'm not good with compliments thank you so much um i appreciate it um i was hoping we can talk about uh montreal a little bit because sahil's actually asked me about montreal and he's like what is in the water up there yeah i call it the montreal mafia yeah did i say it's it's real yeah montreal yeah montreal i'll speak a little strange because montreal is it's the only i mean you know inside of the canadian main cities it's the only bilingual city so what you have is you have a bunch of people like greg and i who grew up there who i think greg you'd probably the same thing we only started learning french in school around the fourth or fifth grade that's right right so most of us did not grow up i mean we're anglophones we speak english at home but in school in quebec you did not learn english until again you're probably you know eight or nine years old and so you know montrealers say things instead of saying like the water is cold they'll say things like it's cold the water which is a weird thing it makes no sense but it sort of takes its cues from the french language but i i actually think at a you know just a montreal city-wide level montreal is an immigrant city and you will find very few people that go back three or four generations uh in montreal greg i suspect your grandparents probably were the first gen in montreal they were born actually in montreal like they were so it's that's fairly not common you know most of um my father was was born in hungary he immigrated to montreal when he was you know five years old and i think one of the things that montreal has done is it's embraced the sort of this immigrant culture which effectively is entrepreneurship because you have no capital you have no experience you have no money so the thing to do is go and find a way to hustle and make you know put food on the table and that takes the form of what is you know famously known as the shemata business in montreal which is the clothing business uh which is you know where dove charney and american apparel got started and you know buffalo jeans and parasuco got started there and a whole pajar a whole bunch of you know global fashion brands all got started in montreal because the barrett entry into that into that industry was low but you know my my grandfather sold eggs at a farmers market for his entire life and so i think more than most cities uh that i've been to montreal embraces this idea of being an entrepreneur and owning your own small business it's so interesting what you just hit on in a number in a number of ways but when i think about like montreal and then new york city right um both are kind of cities of immigrants but new york be very quickly became the center of the financial world and in the early days like it was a center of capitalism and there was so much capital and so i think there's probably a grittiness of the entrepreneurship in montreal that it developed from not being that where it was you know like now they call it bootstrapping but basically you had to you know hustle and figure out how to make the working capital model work and figure out how to how to kind of grind your way to that success because you didn't have those ties to the global financial center like you might have in new york and you didn't necessarily have this the people that i looked up to remember um my first i had a couple businesses when i was a kid like 13 years old but my first real business was a t-shirt business that i launched when i was at mcgill so i was born in montreal i lived there till i was about 12 years old then i moved to south florida with my family i went to uh high school in south florida and then moved back to montreal when i was 17 to go to mcgill and um it was a tough year for my family my my dad was no longer around family goes bankrupt so i started a t-shirt business and i remember uh i remember that um when i told people that i was starting a t-shirt business uh it wasn't that uncommon it wasn't like well aren't you a student aren't you don't you have to go to school it was sort of it felt culturally appropriate or or at least geographically relevant and appropriate that someone in montreal would be starting a t-shirt business and i i don't know if this for a fact because greg and i did not rehearse this but greg i suspect you know a lot of people that started t-shirt businesses i know a ton i know a ton and you're completely right in the sense that like it's almost unusual if you go work at you know if you go work on wall street um and i remember i dropped out of mcgill and i remember i was really scared to have that discussion with my parents and my grandparents and stuff like that um and i went to my grandfather who was an entrepreneur um kind of like old school um and i went to him and i was really nervous about like telling him and i just remember being like hey i'm gonna drop out of school i'm gonna start this company and he wasn't saying anything and i was just like i was just speaking really quickly and i was like oh my is he does he is he gonna prove he's not gonna prove and he was like yeah that makes sense you know it was supportive um and that's kind of the vibe in montreal it's so interesting that you kind of bring up the cultural side of it it's something i think about a lot and i think about it in the context of both broader culture like within a city but then also on a micro level within a family and how entrepreneurship and that grittiness is sort of something that's built in you from a young age and that you learn and you see it around you and like i like i come from my mom is indian my dad is white jewish from the bronx actually my great grandfather was a vegetable peddler in the bronx allegedly uh allegedly he sold vegetables to babe ruth that was like something i was always told as a kid growing up of course you can't prove that that's one of those things that like you can't disprove it but like i was a baseball kid growing up i played baseball in college and so that was always something i told my friends when i was a kid like my great grandfather knew babe ruth um but my family like my my dad's uh academics professor at harvard my grandfather my mom's side similarly an academic we didn't really have i didn't have people around me constantly um that were starting things or that were kind of um you know building new ideas and so when i went to go start my own life and go to college or go get my first job there was always just the pat it was like the clean path was basically you go to college you get a degree you go take a stable job and you kind of work in that make money and put your head down and that was what life was and only when i met greg and a handful of other friends after when co-fed started did i start to see this other side of life and i started having this like decentralized friend group that showed me the other side and the other way of doing things so i'm fascinated by this like cultural entrepreneurship movement as it were i think it also depends on you know who are the role models in any particular community obviously in the valley you have a certain set of role models that would be very different than you know say on wall street and i think in montreal or you can sort of replace montreal with entrepreneurial cities um you know for example like i've been told that chicago is incredibly entrepreneurial relative to new york for example um and i don't know i don't know all the american cities but toronto for example is i think less entrepreneurial it's the biggest city and in canada it's far more you know there's like there's the wall street of canada called bay street in toronto and i think it depends on who are the who do people try to emulate and in a place like montreal you tried to emulate at least i did growing up the entrepreneurs the people that started something from nothing and i remember in those first couple of months of starting this t-shirt business there was this coffee shop uh in chabanel which is the montreal garment district called gentilly uh greg i'm not sure if you ever went there of course um but it was it was a sort of you know kind of grimy coffee shop but the cool part is you can kind of just sit there at the coffee bar and you can listen to mostly these like you know old men these old jewish men you know talk about uh business and talk about what it was like to start and and they would you know they would complain and they would lament but they also would sort of talk strategy and talk about deal making and i think because of that um those were sort of the leaders of the city and i think because those are the leaders of the city those are people wanted to emulate it encouraged people to try their hand in entrepreneurship in a way that felt almost safe if you failed because at least you mean this is sort of you know greg your grandfather and this conversation with your grandfather is well you know go and try he he didn't necessarily talk you out of it where where i suspect a lot of people that didn't grow up in a place like that with a family like that would say are you crazy like go to school get a degree that is exact that is the the safest way to to make money or to be successful i i also think uh so could not agree more on on a few things okay a few reactions to that number one like i think it's so important that everyone finds their own gentiles whatever that is you know just a safe spot where they could share stories share experiences um harley i'm curious like how how important do you think that is to some of the entrepreneurs that you see in terms of you know having a safe spot is that is that key to success so we're going to jump around timelines a little bit here but um just to connect some dots so i finished undergrad finished uh university actually didn't finish at mcgill i finished a concordia which is uh sort of you know mcgill's kind of uh younger brother across the street in montreal my teacher business had you know had some success and mcgill did not encourage you to be a full-time uh working student you either went to school or you worked but doing it together concurrently was sort of frowned upon and they would encourage you to do a reduced course load and you know i was all of 18 years old or 19 years old and i didn't want to do that so there was another university in in montreal which is you know not necessarily as prestigious or well known as mcgill but they they were totally fine with me being an entrepreneur student so i transferred and i graduated and a mentor of mine who had been a mentor of mine since i was a kid convinced me to go to law school um not to become a lawyer but to become a better entrepreneur and this particular mentor his name is philip reimer um he was teaching law that that year in 2005 at the university of ottawa he was effectively taking off some time from his legal practice to teach which is something that was very meaningful to him and so he said why don't you you know apply to school university of ottawa and go to law school there and i got to ottawa in 2005 i i'd never been here even though it's so close to montreal ottawa just was not on my it wasn't on my radar it's the capital of canada but just never been here and the first thing i did was i asked where the entrepreneurs hung out because the entrepreneurial community had effectively became my tribe when i moved to south florida as you know a 13 year old jewish kid i didn't know anyone i also you know immediately there was a club at my at the high school i went to is called spanish river high school a very large public high school uh there was something called business uh young business leaders of america or something like that and i joined that club and i met more entrepreneurs and those became my friends and so when i got to ottawa i asked where the entrepreneurs were and i was directed to a coffee shop in ottawa and that's where i met toby i was doing the t-shirt thing he was doing the snowboard thing and and so not only do i think having a space where you can go a safe space where you can go and learn and talk and and and find you know and hear about these great war stories from people that are more accomplished than you are but i think it's also important if you're an entrepreneur to find your tribe you know i spend my entire life trying to encourage more people to be to try their hand in entrepreneurship but the one thing that most people don't talk about is that it's really really lonely i mean i don't know if i can curse on this podcast but like it's [ __ ] lonely it's really lonely it's it's probably the most lonely profession out there you know even if you are you know uh in a service-based business at least you have like colleagues around but like when you're an entrepreneur there's nobody around and and for the most part if your parents don't believe in you and your you know and and your friends think you're crazy like it's it's just you're always by yourself and so not only do i think a place like gentilia a physical location is important to go and spend time but also the people that you will meet there presumably and and hopefully will become potentially your next your business partners as was the case for me this is one of my favorite things uh to talk about because you're hitting on like two concepts that are incredible independently and also collectively because they tie together one is like this whole idea of um you know locations where smart people can come together and gather and like those rooms i mean we call this show you know the room where it happens because it's like these rooms have always existed and they've never been democratized because you didn't know you might not have access to that room you might not have gentilia you might not be able to access that group you know the the people that are in the coffee shop whatever it is a lot of that is now in the cloud and greg and i were talking about it before you joined that like the cost of failure is so low today because you can start things up you can try things you can rent scale your business in a box like shopify which we can talk about all of these things exist and you can go access these people through the internet you can go find these friend groups find these rooms where these conversations are happening in the cloud and you don't have to be in a physical location anymore a kid on the streets in india that has access to his phone because of what reliance geo has done has a lot of the same opportunities today and hopefully will continue to have even more um as the kid who grew up in greenwich and went to the ivy league and that is such an amazing empowering thing of technology the other thing you hit on which i love i was talking about with someone recently is this whole idea of like decentralized friend groups um which to me is an interesting concept you historically had centralized friend groups you had your like one pocket of friends that you all you went to school with or you had a job with and those were your friends and centralized friend groups are great but they also create kind of an environment of group think you're like the same type of people they grew up in the same neighborhood and have the same set of experiences backgrounds etc decentralized friend groups are something that i think has been accelerated by covid because you have these pockets of friends that you've met in discord servers you've met in group chats you've met all over the world that you're interacting with and the result of that is you have these creative new ideas you go pursue new things it completely changed my life meeting greg and some of the people that were in a group chat um so that because with any group because fundamentally with any group which you have is you have a centerpiece so the centerpiece is the thing that sits in the middle of the group and i think historically the centerpiece has been location so i go to a particular high school that's my centerpiece we go to high school together or i grew up in a particular neighborhood um you know that's my centerpiece and i think now the major shift that you're describing is from centralized friend groups or or community to decentralize is that now the centerpiece is interest and so it doesn't matter where you're located it doesn't matter frankly what your socioeconomic status of your parents might be because who the hell cares about that what matters now is what is the center piece of of of actual interest and and i'm in a whatsapp group right now a yakitori whatsapp group i kid you not i'm really into like this this sort of my kovid hobby was making yakitori for my wife and daughters which is japanese barbecue i was just looking it up while you it's really cool it's if you like cooking and hosting it's like this amazing thing because you get to pick the charcoal and each charcoal smells different there's all these techniques and it's cool like very similar to any great you know hobby um you can't get there's no perfection perfection is is is impossible so you're always working at it but i you know i have uh a yakitori group of people on uh that we share stories on um on whatsapp which most people all never meet in person but they're my friends we communicate we spend time together on digitally and i think actually going back to tying that back to entrepreneurship that is what i think is so interesting right now of being an entrepreneur is that for the first time i think maybe ever you mentioned that the cost of failure is as close to zero well that's true but also it is less lonely now because it seems at least to me that we now know more people that are entrepreneur entrepreneurs or entrepreneurial than ever before and part of that you know i like to i think shopify and companies like shopify has made it more accessible from a tooling perspective from a functionality perspective but i also think like from a society perspective you know um you you get a high five if you go to some ivy league school but you also get a high five if you launch this really cool new direct to consumer brand you know making tea or something like that and i think that is so fascinating so it ties directly into like my favorite thing about shopify which is this whole framework of arming the rebels um and i know it's something you guys talked about in the past and i love it as a general concept and i think it's fascinating but i would love to hear what it means to you and how you think about that tying into what you guys are building so the um that where that came out of is you know if if amazon is is building an empire the metaphor is that shopify is arming the rebels and part of it is that for a very very long time um it was very difficult for someone with a product to to reach an audience to get the product into the hands of of anyone uh around the world if you go back like 300 years i mean everyone's talking about direct to consumer now as if it's like this crazy fad and i by the way i don't think it's a fad i think it actually will be steady state but if you go back 300 years when you as a consumer wanted to buy bread you bought bread from the baker and you bought shoes from the cobbler and that's just how it went and then uh in this date i know for sure i know we're talking about dates earlier but in this statement around 1876 there was a department store the first department store was created in philadelphia it was called wanna makers department store it was created by john wanamaker who was this entrepreneur uh politician he actually he was the guy who coined the phrase fifty percent of my marketing works the problem was i don't know which 50 percent and so you had this so that was the introduction of intermediation in commerce and retail and effectively that's kind of how retail operated uh you know for the last i don't know call it 130 years or so where you have a product you went to go meet a buyer um you know at some big department store or some grocery chain or some you know local boutique and you tried to convince them to put the product on the shelf and you shared the profit margin with them and the reason that that physical store was entitled to a percentage of your profit margin was because they were giving you distribution they were renting you their customers for a cost and the internet happens and now the internet all of a sudden makes distribution effectively commoditized it's it's universal now it's democratized anyone can can distribute it but it was still very very difficult if you were wanted to get your your product in the hands of consumers even with e-commerce and i think if you look at the early days of e-commerce in the united states um which by the way looks very similar to what e-commerce looks like right now in china even though china's at a much bigger scale most commerce most e-commerce in china right now is happening through a marketplace whether it's jd or taobao or team or alibaba but in the last 15 years or so what has happened is um through companies like shopify but but also others as well there's sort of been this trend now where makers entrepreneurs creators um you know business owners have said i actually want to have a direct relationship with the person buying my products and using shopify or using a product like shopify they are able to alleviate and remove the inter intermediary the middle person and go direct to the consumer so part of what i think has happened as you sort of zoom out now you see a vast majority of of commerce uh still happens on marketplaces i don't know the exact number but you know if you look at amazon something neighborhood of 35 to 45 of all e-commerce in the united states is done on amazon and a lot of that is done is third-party marketplace uh commerce so it's not amazon selling it's it's them inviting third parties to sell their products on on that marketplace and that works great uh and from a consumer if i wanna buy something fast and cheap and easy it's a great way to do that but you as the merchants those are not your customers you are renting customers from amazon and if you decide you want to leave amazon for whatever reason you you don't take your customers with you our version is we think that actually you should be able to have a direct relationship with the end consumer you should be able to own the entire stack of of the customer relationship because it's your business and you know we now have about two million uh stores on shopify um which is amazing but if they if any of those merchants want to leave shop i hope they don't those are their customers that don't belong to shopify and one of the other things that's happened is that sort of on the supply side on the demand side you also see consumers more than ever before today voting with their wallets to buy direct from those independent direct to consumer brands that's the reason why you hear so much about you know uh jim shark or why all birds and and figs and bombus or and fashion nova and tommy john underwear all these amazing brands are able to do so well it's because it's entirely their business and they own it they don't have to rent customers anymore and so to us and certainly to me on a personal level that is the way that we are allowing and enabling these sort of rebels to be successful and fight off sort of the the evil empire i suppose um and i think direct to consumer is not just a fad but rather it's a much better way to do commerce and i suspect that's what that's gonna that's where it's going i think there will be a place for marketplace based commerce particularly when you're buying something that is somewhat commoditized something you need but you know i'm wearing a blue salt hoodie and i'm wearing james purse pants and i'm wearing bomba socks i'm never going to a marketplace to buy this i'm going to go directly to jamespurse.com or bluesaltorbamas.com to buy it because it's my way as a consumer of voting with my wallet to say i want more of those brands to exist yeah and you have you have a really unique thing in that number one you measure the success of shopify in the success of your customers and so when i see toby or you celebrating the latest ipo of a shopify based brand that is such a cool thing because it's so directly tied uh to you to see your customers succeed you're not you know competing with them in any way like it is very very real and it's so real in terms of the authenticity that comes across from you toby the whole team how excited you are when those kind of things happen and when you're able to scale with these companies so that they can go do that the other piece is similar to what greg what i was talking to you about with morris chang and tsmc in that you have this story that has enabled so many people to become entrepreneurs and so you've armed the rebels and there were rebels that existed that just needed to be armed you've also created a bunch of rebels um in a way which i love because there's so many people who they had an idea they had something really cool they wanted to start it but man it was really hard before and it was so hard i don't know how to code i don't know how to set up a website or create a store or get manufacturers and do drop shipping there's so much [ __ ] right but all of a sudden now because of something like a shopify or like a tsmc in the semiconductor space you can go rent that you can have this kind of business in a box and so my great idea now i can actually bring to life quite easily and more importantly you can focus on your great idea as opposed to focusing on you know servers or merchandising or inventory management or fulfillment if you look at the shop of filming network for example all these things that we think are pain points that we can help with that's we can and we can make it so that you as the entrepreneur can just focus on doing what you do best which is making your your actual product and one thing that i don't think people you know people talk about gmv of shopify and and how much our merchants are selling and you know if you were to pretend shopify was a retailer i think you probably have seen me say this number of times if you pretend we were retailer we would be the second largest online retailer in america after amazon the reason that that's important is because what we now can do that we haven't been able to do even five years ago is we now can go and act like we're the second largest retailer on things like capital and payments and fulfillment and shipping and we can give any entrepreneur that's getting started on shopify right now every 28 seconds an entrepreneur gets their for sale anyone starting right now can get access to all these tools as if they're the second largest retailer in america that is a real leveling of the playing field that is what it means to arm the rebels but that's that's only half of it the other half of it is that when we um we went public uh may 24th i think at the sort of uh badge up there may 24 2015 we went public we was a dual listing new york stock exchange and and toronto stock exchange and i remember on the road show uh which is a fascinating experience for any entrepreneur and uh frankly one of the most fun uh couple weeks of my life they ask you but tam what is your total addressable market because of course the analysts need to create their model they need to figure out you know what is this company worth and how what what is the what is the growth rate and what is the potential for this business and the the best number we would give was something like well there are like 46 million retail smbs in the world and so you know at the time i don't know we had 100 000 merchants i'm not sure exactly the number was but no we we have a long runway and the reason we gave that number is because they we had to give a number they wanted to know what our tam was but that actually was not even close to being accurate because at the time because that definition was someone that was an existing entrepreneur who maybe wanted to expand their business or move from offline to online um rather i think a more honest and and truthful definition of our total just market is anyone that wants to make something and then ensure someone else gets access to it and i think whether it's a vertical which is you know huge right now like nfts and you see jimmy butler and martha stewart using shopify to sell nfts or it's you know drop shipping a couple years ago which frankly i thought was just was totally misunderstood and i think drop shipping was just this great process improvement for retail where instead of spending money on inventory you were able to you know spend your money on marketing um all these things are able to emerge now because more people have decided that entrepreneurship may be for them and that was not the case even 10 years ago it was you know greg growing up i know you were sort of in your group of friends you were the entrepreneur um and that was kind of a you were unique in that you weren't the athlete you weren't the you know debate champion you were the entrepreneur and your group of friends like i was um that was a unique thing my hope and my suspicion is that is far less unique today and shopify is doing such a good job at supporting all these people and i want to read you an email i just pulled it up that my dad sent me about okay my dad has been a retailer comes from a retail family you know i don't know 100 years or so something um i'll have to send him this clip um and he recently told me that he you know he had this yahoo stores for like many many years and he recently told me um that he was going to move to shopify and he sends me an email and my brother on it and he says built he says my new website built it all by myself with three hours of customer service help from shopify it was a blast to do and i called him and he was so stoked to so you know he he built this thing by himself sales are coming in um and the support just having uh the support of shopify is is sometimes what people need to to actually um you know we talked about this actually before you came on like taking an idea and actually executing it yeah and how how much do you do do you think about that in terms of uh supporting the you know the ecosystem in terms of like product road mapping and stuff like that a ton i mean you know couple of things that i think shopify has a couple competitive advantages um one of one of those advantages uh and we'll talk a bit about the ecosystem the partners because they play a huge role in shopify in the last i don't know 12 months or so um i think i said this in the last earnings call like 46 000 partners agencies freelancers have referred shops merchants to shopify so they're sort of distributed you know force out there uh distributed like salesforce out there you know encouraging people to try their hand on entrepreneurship and use shopify part of that also is there are right now as we sit here thousands of app developers all over the world thinking about how to make shopify's product better so that no matter who you are no matter what your business is no matter what your dad is selling whatever that use case may be there is a way there's functionality he can add to a shopify store to give him a 100 product market fit on the support thing it's a it's it's a fascinating thing because you know in in in product organizations and product companies you can kind of look at support two ways you can say well support is effectively um uh subsidizing a deficiency in the product that the product is not good enough so you need support we never really looked at it that way even from a very early stage we always you know focused on having someone that you can talk to 24 7 even if it's not a technical support call um one of the things we we often do shopify just using slack is we'll post a lot of um recordings message um uh phone calls uh with permission for merchants of a particular call and a support person may say uh support advisor may say hey there's a really cool call and posted to the whole company we'll listen to it together or at a town hall we do everything every thursday we'll listen to support calls and what you notice is that often what people need is not necessarily technical support where they're trying to you know use an api or they're trying to integrate some sort of third party erp system most of it is just like business coaching it's someone who's on the other line that says yeah you know i see you've had a couple sales um hey it looks like you know you're getting great traffic from instagram or from pinterest or from you know some other uh some other site have you thought about activating the pinterest channel the instagram channel the ticktock channel so support is is often i think looked at technology companies and software companies as this technology support but rather when you're talking to entrepreneurs in many cases first-time entrepreneurs often what they need is they just need a voice in the other end to give them you know to tell them to keep going to give them some tips about maybe something they haven't thought about yet and that's a huge part of our business um and even today uh you know there are there are brands that started on shopify around around their mom's kitchen table that are now multi-billion dollar companies um who i still speak to every week or two ben francis uh who's ceo and founder of jim shark is someone that i've known pretty much from day one when he was a pizza delivery boy uh in london and starting to do jim shark on the side to now where i think jim shark is probably one of the biggest rivals of nike if you can you know if you can believe that um and i still speak to him fairly regularly now the questions are you know more about scale and more about building an executive team and coaching um but that that matters a great deal to us and and you know this is going to sound a little bit like mother goose but but shopify in many ways if you sort of reflect go back a little bit when we talked about growing up in montreal there is no better company for for me for for me to work at for hardly to work at in the world than shopify because fundamentally and i think you guys do this so well too both of you do this um your professional life's work your professional mission and the mission of this podcast and frankly the mission of your businesses is pretty much the same think of how unique that is i mean greg i don't know what your what your dad sells and and uh i assume it's a physical product but i suspect that he may be interested in his business i'm not necessarily sure that he would say that he's obsessed with that thing um or you know go back you know 50 years and look at someone is running a tire company um was that leader was that founder was that you know executive were they obsessed with tires or was it more just like widgets to them and they could be selling tires or they could be selling you know cars they could be selling anything or light bulbs it doesn't really matter to them and i think the opportunity that that a lot of us have and you two are sort of poster children for this and and i think i am too is that their the overlap of my personal mission my personal interest and my professional mission interests are completely overlapped that is so unique that's an incredible way i've never actually contextualized it for myself that way and it is it is a really powerful thing to think about it also makes me think you know what is the atomic unit of passion um for that tire sales you know for the for the tire entrepreneur because for them yeah it might be a widget the tire but maybe what they love is the feeling of um selling or helping customers yeah it could be a tire it could be a you know different widget but they still feel like it's their life's work to kind of help people i don't know get get through their life in a more efficient way have you guys thought just on on your prior note about kind of um the loneliness of entrepreneurs and this network you've created and needing to just talk to somebody have you guys ever thought about like creating some sort of shopify sellers like mentor pods or like network where people can you know find someone to talk to that isn't necessarily you know a person they see on a daily basis yeah so uh we have two experiments running right now one is in um downtown la and the road dtla um which is it's called the shopify space and anyone can walk in and there are support people on the ground there uh you can be a shopify merchant or not if you want to have you know just sit around and and work you can there's like classes and and courses there and workshops there's a photography studio there's a podcast studio oh cool and then we just opened up one in excuse me in november in new york city yeah uh on green street i believe um and again anyone can walk in and it's just again like it's not about shopify it's about you know just walk in and and if you're an entrepreneur you are welcome here and what's so interesting is when you walk into these places and i've had a chance to spend time in both i mean it's cool to have these workshops and we had you know atom bomb squad and the hundreds there giving a talk a little a couple weeks ago and there's some really cool things happening great coffee bar there but more importantly what you end up seeing is that someone is just sitting working on a laptop and someone else is next to them and they've never met before and very quickly you almost you watch this interaction sort of happen in like in like hyper real time and they'll say what are you working on i'm working on this oh that's a problem i'm currently facing or you'll you'll go to the photography studio which is kind of downstairs in the soho space and you'll see someone go up to somebody like hey try taking the photo like this as opposed to like this and it's it's kind of an amazing thing to watch and in in some ways where this you know what this gets to a little bit is this idea of of like zero-sum thinking or the opposite is here so i'm thinking that i think so many entrepreneurs uh past generations sort of our parents and grandparent generations entrepreneurship was this kind of highly guarded secret like don't tell anyone it's mine and i don't want anyone to share in in in this and know my strategy that's another thing that's that's been completely flipped i think because distribution because now everyone's addressable market is the world is that the zero-sum thinking is is really going away and so people are happy to share you know um how to do great adwords and using particular tags or how to create great content on youtube i mean if someone asked you how you guys have created this amazing podcast i suspect you would say well here's what we did i don't think you'd i don't think you would um i don't think you would limit that information because you were they were to compete with you because that's not really how you think about the world you think about the world in a in in that there is unlimited amounts of of energy and unlimited amounts of audiences for this great podcast and i think that is really cool and totally different i call it positive sum magnetism uh i like that it is i think of it as when you when you start genuinely celebrating the wins of others you find that you start winning a whole lot more too totally um and there's something so beautiful about that when you can just genuinely cheer for other people to succeed and feel so happy for your friends and you and honestly feel even happier when you see your friends succeed than when you succeed totally and you just find that good things start happening when you adopt that mentality in life i totally agree with you harley i gotta ask because you mentioned adam bomb squad and uh actually bo sahil and i have atom bombs what uh and i noticed you've been getting into it can you tell us about your um what you know the rabbit hole of web 3 and and just like how you're feeling about it all um yeah i mean frankly i i i read uh a lot of what you guys write on the topic and i i listen to your podcast and and uh you know i subscribe to your sub stack uh greg so a lot of what i i'm learning is i'm sort of learning as i go here i think a couple of things i think that you know we talked a little bit about um more people are trying their hand on entrepreneurship and more people are trying to participate in this in this sort of modern economy and i think web 3 does that i think anything that allows you know i um right behind me uh i have this it's called a harold town as the painting behind me it's one of my favorite artists it's a canadian artist i bought it from uh from his he's he's long gone but he was sort of like one of the rebels of the canadian art scene in the 50s his art's super cool and i bought it from a gallery owned by his family um i love it i'm going to keep it but at some point maybe i get sick of it and i i resell it the fact that his family doesn't get anything from that resale even if i resell it for double or triple what i bought it for which i might be able to because the price of his art has gone up dramatically um that seems weird and what i think i like about web3 generally is that it feels far more to use this term democratic it feels far more fair the fact that i can you know uh if i were able to embed some smart contract and that 10 percent of every of the resale price goes back to the family who i've gotten to know pretty well and frankly their f that family can use this money i mean this isn't a very wealthy family this is a family who you know is relying on the income from uh from harold townes art that i think is is incredibly interesting the other part that i think is interesting is that whether they're nfts or anyone participating in web 3 it feels very entrepreneurial um i know you both sort of look at it from the lens of community which i think is absolutely accurate but it also feels more entrepreneurial it feels and more people are now commercializing their art their thing their their their widget their product and that i think is really cool i think it's also you know um just to give some some concrete examples here um during uh the first round of covet in 2020 you'll remember that um there was that uh the nba played in that bubble in disney um i forgot what the bubble was called but anyways apparently the coffee in the bubble was not very good and uh a great uh great ball player named jimmy butler uh who's of course very famous uh started making coffee for his colleagues and friends and teammates and frankly people in other teams and he would charge 20 bucks for this coffee and it became kind of a thing a kind of a you know a an interesting thing that was happening in the bubble that jimmy jimmy butler was creating uh was basically making coffee out of his like quote unquote dorm room and selling it and then you know things go back to normal and then jimmy butler decides to create big face coffee brand um on launch on shopify and i remember going and i love this idea i thought this was so so cool and i remember going to uh big face coffee and everything is sold out and i was like oh that's that's shitty like i wanna i wanna support him i love this idea of an athlete also becoming an entrepreneur and i got tons of examples i can talk to a beast mode apparel and the story with marshawn lynch which is a really cool one too but i i want to support i wanted to vote with my wallet and so instead of buying uh the coffee which was sold out i actually bought one of his big face nfts and you know it's my it's in my rainbow wallet and you know i don't display it anywhere but i like the fact that i have this thing that i can do this this tool that i have at my disposal as a consumer to vote for something to exist and more recently you know learning about i got a chance to uh spend some time with bobby hundreds and understand how the hundreds have sort of formed i think they're an amazing amazing brand of course but they're also very very talented designers that i now can vote with my wallet to support them by not only buying an atom bomb nft but also i can display as my profile picture on twitter which is right now this idea of encouraging more people to commercialize something deeply personal to them is really cool and i think web 3 does a lot of that now like any new trend i think there's probably a dark side to this i don't you you two would know more about that than i would and so you know i think there there should be some some form of skepticism i don't think people should take their rent money and go buy a bunch of nfts if they can't afford to uh if the price drops but i do think that this idea of them there being way more uh opportunity is is is only gonna be a good thing and then from a commerce perspective where i think this gets super cool is that um you know uh one of the recent hundreds drops was basically gated um and the the key to access the drop was uh having one of the having one of their nft's uh particular collection grant of teas this is getting really interesting and so you can think about an artist for example um you know i talked a little bit about uh um athletes becoming entrepreneurs but artists also becoming entrepreneurs and you can sort of see it and there's some cool stuff happening i mean you know this is kind of an old school example but um when i used to go to concerts when i was a kid and i wanted to support the band i would go to the merch table and buy some shitty guilt and t-shirt with a screen print and the tour dates on the back i think that's what we all did whereas now if i go to um you know a drake show i can go to and buy an ovo collaboration with canada goose jacket which actually is the winter jacket that i wear uh all the time so it's just it's this fascinating thing now you can imagine if i'm a really big drake fan that i can buy a particular nft and now i get access to different merchant only is for his best fans or his most important uh you know the people that he values their commitment to it to him the most that's where the stuff gets really really cool and um and so and that's i i think more entrepreneurs is a good thing and i think web 3 is actually producing more entrepreneurs than ever before funny story about atom bomb squad which greg will laugh at me about when uh when they released um it was like you know mystery nfts when they when they first dropped and greg and i were talking about it i was like oh that's a cool project i should go buy a couple and um i fat fingered a buy and bought a uh mystery release bobby uh adam bomb squad nft for 2.5 eth when they were all at 0.25 and um then i like you know i was looking around like an idiot it was like one of my first nft purchases and greg was making fun of me and then a few days later the release happened it turned out the thing was a rare one and i sold it for five eighth like a few days later and lucky so it turned out to be like rather be lucky than good um but no completely agree with you you know i personally think of all these things in like gartner hype cycle terms or you know clearly there is a ton of hype that has been built around this but there is also a ton of really interesting underlying innovation and progress and the reality with a lot of it is it's sort of a natural evolutionary feature this hype because it draws a ton of capital but also a ton of talent into the space that will build the next layer of innovation so even if we go through kind of a cycle where it's a bear market and people aren't talking about it every day those people in the capital really did come in to build something like we just saw ryan the head of gaming at youtube just took a job to you know go be ceo of polygon labs crazy big big web 2 role and he leaves to go take this job in web 3. there's a lot of that happening and it does feel there's something that's very real and i actually heard this on one of your podcasts i think with alexis where you guys are talking about you know watch where the smart people are going to work and you can sort of see trends that way i i think that's certainly the case what i like about it is this like this term starving artist um has been it's it's been a real thing for decades or hundreds and hundreds of years where someone who's so creative who makes beautiful art can afford to put food on their table i'm not suggesting that web 3 changes that i am suggesting however that web 3 makes it a little bit easier to make a living and if that is where this is going i'm going to support it so we have to ask you before we uh before we lose you here we always try to wrap the episode with asking for predictions so give us your you know it doesn't have to be several give us your predictions for you know five ten years from now in in technology and the world of entrepreneurship but what do you what do you think the world looks like what are your what are your predictions um that's a loaded question a couple things first of all i think we started by talking started the episode by talking about home towns and cities and where we where greg and i grew up um i actually think the concept of hometown is changing i think from where humans like what what a human says their hometown will change fairly dramatically over the next 10 years i think i think it'll kind of be like this where there's a like you'll have an hq where you or your family you know my for me it's my wife and my two daughters like we're based sort of our hq but i think we'll have a lot of satellite locations and it's not to say we're gonna have like homes everywhere like that it's just where we spend our time i think that is going to uh will not go away post covid uh i think that that that idea of hometown will change and i think actually that that's that's really interesting um that creates a bunch of ripple effects into so many areas i mean you think of the storytelling of your daughters how education is going to fundamentally that's right because the school is going to have to uh and also what what i believe education is i mean you know um my wife and i i went to law school my wife's uh you know as a psychotherapist we went to graduate school i don't think my kids are going to do that um if they want to they can but i'm not sure they will but that's right that that will change but also in terms of my connection to the hometown um the way that i want to contribute to my hometown i mean when i moved to auto 105 part of and i've been here now for you know uh for for 17 years now if i felt a commitment to the city i still do and if i spend less time here does that commitment change and how does that all work out and so that i think is going to be uh or even where does my mail get uh where do i get mail right it's like home phones are gone so it's not really an issue anymore but but where does mail arrive when someone wants to reach me that's going to change as well so there'll be a ton of ripple effects i think around the idea of like what is someone's hometown i think um i i i do a lot of you know broadcast and tv and so i think a lot of it brought you know broadcast and television for example one thing i thought that is super fascinating is um if you look at uh the nielsen ratings for q4s on out you have a q3 is that for 2021 the number one the mo sorry the show with the highest average views on television i'm sort of eye roll but it's tucker carlson whether you hate him or like him that that is you know that's factual there's about i think there's a 3.5 million average views per episode for tucker carlson um and below that you have kind of you know cnn and all the others um but if you look at average views on joe rogan it's 11 million it's you know it's almost four times as big that is unbelievable and i don't think i think that's going to change the media landscape this is a weird comment to make but a couple of months ago kim kardashian was on snl and uh if you watch her i i don't step that late but i did watch her her monologue and she said this thing that was fascinating i think it went over everybody's head for the most part because it was sort of a joke but she said it is uh this is kim talking she said it is really nice to be on snl in front of an intimate audience i think on that show snl did something like seven or eight million viewers and again she was poking she was kind of making a joke but what she meant was that that is probably the smallest audience that she has had on anything she said in the past year or two because she can get hundreds of millions of people watching her pretty much do anything that is a dramatic shift or you think about um so so i think just on the media side i think we all kind of know that that the future of media is probably not you know exclusively linear television but i think from an entrepreneur perspective if you're thinking about how to get your story out there and you're using a pr firm they're trying to get you on you know good morning america and it's not working it doesn't matter there are so many other ways that are easier to to leverage and easier to get attention that actually may have even higher viewer numbers which i think is also quite fascinating uh tension is decentralized now that's right and actually it's it's it's could be even more impactful in the way that um in the way that that we can all do it without you know having connections or relationships into the big you know big broadcasters um probably in the last one just because i i sort of spent most of my time thinking about commerce and and retail i think talking about omni channel selling on online or offline or you know instagram or we just announced a partnership with jd so now merch in the chat they can push products right to jd uh we have an integration with spotify so shop so spotify um artists can can easily sell merchandise to their fans i i think talking about a cup talking about omni channel in the future will be like talking about a color tv today you never would say color tv i think every business will be by its very nature omni channel even restaurants um you know the french laundry this famous restaurant in uh in napa uh in youngville like now has a shopify store where they're selling meal kits and they're selling cookbooks and they're selling kitchenware and it's just go there during the uh during the day i mean totally tone deaf but uh but so i i think this this idea omni channel even though you hear it at every single retail and commerce event and every white paper and uh i i think that is just gonna be steady stated that's just what it's gonna be um what else um those are great yeah those are some of the ones yeah those are some of the ones i've been thinking about i think people are people will start you know yeah those are some of the ones that are on top of my mind right now i've got a loaded last question where do you think the the t space is going because i know you are involved in a tea company and and next time well you're you can come back on the show anytime you want but the next time we need to be drinking tea i i totally agree i am drinking my fire belly tea right now i mean part of the fire belly thing is uh this is not me trying to you know promote fire belly but i've been drinking coffee for most of my life um i've had anxiety most of my life as well i didn't necessarily recognize that there was a direct relationship between my afternoon coffee consumption and my anxiety levels it was only the last couple years actually through covid that i discovered it one of my closest friends is david siegel who famously built i think probably one of the only billion dollar tea companies ever david's tea uh they had like 400 locations he took it public in 2013 i think um and so during covid i told him that i need to stop drinking coffee because i was just my anxiety levels were not being helped by it and he turned me on to green tea and he curated this amazing green tea for me like the best green tea on the planet and so that happens and then at the same time uh the last time i built a store on shopify was in like 2006 it was a t-shirt shop i was one of the first merchants on shopify that's how i met you know that's why i got introduced to the company and i wanted to know what it was like to build a brand new uh business and brand in 2022 and so we launched firebelly tea together and so we have this great tea company which every accessory is made by david it's like all the accessories he always wanted but couldn't find he he designed it all from scratch and has like the world's best tea and so uh i think i think more people should drink tea i think most people assume that tea is like you know they don't really understand it they got in like a gift box or some sort of like you know gift package and like they'll have um and actually tea uh is for me at least it gives me this incredible calm alertness uh and anxiety levels have been better uh and i can sleep at night uh far better than i did when i was drinking coffee so it's been it's been super helpful well i'm gonna do a one-click check out using shop pay on firebelly tea.com right now to try this out and isn't shopping amazing isn't shopping the best amazing to try to kick my large dunkin donuts cold brew habit in the afternoon uh you do can you sleep okay the nights when you have that i blew out this is a longer story for you at some point but i blew out my caffeine receptors playing baseball in college because i was hurt and so i was ending up drinking i don't know so you can just 100 milligrams to like just not feel pain when i was throwing so i can still do it but it's not good for me and i know yeah so i'm gonna i'm gonna buy using my one click checkout chape oh thank you um some of this matcha probably harley won't promote it but i will promote it check out firebelly tea the the slogan's amazing it's i think it's feel the difference because you will feel a difference so check it out everyone's listening um harley you've

unique products there and as a creator you can make and list your products at a super low cost and have this incredible discovery engine to go sell and scale your business i highly recommend you check it out today go to appsumo.com backslash the room it's red where are we starting musk your boy um musk my boy that's your god dude elon musk no he isn't huh oh my god i thought you were a tesla guy you love tesla don't you i never owned drove in in a ball that's true actually drive a volvo that's true are you anti elon musk no i think elon musk is like a big visionary okay i like that he lived in canada oh that's right queen's college queen's yeah yeah i think my like very briefly queen's college queen's university oh is that different okay yeah i don't know anything about queen's college in new york queens college is in new york that's where alexander hamilton went right or he was trying to go yeah i remember that from hamilton so elon musk interesting guy visionary consumer does some weird stuff from time to time to drum up intrigue online and recently he does this twitter poll that has caused a ton of stir he basically tweeted out about all the stuff that people are talking about with unrealized capital gains and the idea of like taxing billionaires on their wealth and he tweets out this poll that just says uh you know do you support me selling 10 percent of my tesla shares to pay taxes basically because he doesn't take a salary he doesn't take a bonus whatever so this would be the way that he pays taxes um what did you think of this what i like about elon he's like he gets the internet yes he gets the internet yeah you know so i don't know how many people voted do you know how many people like millions 50 million yeah crazy yeah so i think like he got them bought in on this decision and what was it like 50 something percent said do it yeah 55 45 something like that yeah so i think like now he has okay how many of those were like burner accounts of like nancy pelosi yeah probably they wanted to be in there just like box hitting yes probably but i think like the cool okay what did he achieve step one is he achieved just like elon musk getting out there his name getting out there tesla getting out there so like good good work and step two is now he has carte blanche to sell like a billion dollars of stock 20 billion 20 billion dollars insane yeah 20 billion the thing that i think is just i i like it right he he understands the internet i think you're totally right he knows how to drive intrigue without it being like a tesla ad right all of this benefits tesla at best benefits uh spacex boring company all of his things because it's like elon musk halo that he creates around all this stuff but there's kind of a dark side to it right like what if he knew about some bad developments at tesla and he tweets this out knowing that like the yes is probably gonna win and want him to sell and then he goes and sells 20 billion of stock which like is technically insider trading i think if he knew that there was going to be bad developments coming out about it but now he he's like oh i have to abide by the twitter poll so i got to do it that way so i think there's like it's it's gray area it's sketchy territory especially given he's gotten in trouble in the past for the sec for what he did a few years ago with the whole like funding secured when there was clearly no funding secured can you remind me what happened again he tweeted out thinking of taking tesla private at 420 per share which is obvious joke 420 um and said funding secured and there was no funding secured and he basically said like saudis or someone was going to fund this deal and at the time tesla was trading at like 350. so the stocks spiked and then the next day it was like funding's not secured the stock collapsed so a bunch of people got smoked lost a bunch of money then it bought in thinking that he was being real and so he got like sort of slapped on the wrist like he has to have a twitter babysitter now effectively but yeah to me elon is like a typical entrepreneur yeah always pushing the limits like asking for uh forgiveness yeah rather than approval rather than approval and he just gets the internet yeah so like i honestly like kudos to him like he dude i think tesla's at a trillion dollar market cap way over yeah way over a trillion dollars and it's all not all through memes like they have a great product but the lesson there is like memes plus great product equals good things happen yeah the hype machine and the fact that they don't spend a dollar on marketing he's doing it all without marketing these car companies are spending hundreds of billions of dollars and he doesn't have to because of what he's created when you go into a tesla showroom you you can't like test drive a car right you can't buy a car yeah i mean it's a different experience for sure it's a completely different you got to buy it online you got to buy it online yeah like but they have showrooms like all over the world yeah he understands the internet you're absolutely right and it actually feeds into what i want to talk about today so let's get our drinks going and we can dive into the conversation which is all related to building hype on the internet so it's morning so good morning accordingly we're going to have mimosas how do you feel about that you're a music guy um i just flinched i like literally just flinched for no i was like do i trust you with like even though you know i've never seen you open that you know what do you think i was gonna do spray you yeah i don't know you're unpredictable [Laughter] all right so you know what this is going to taste like so i don't feel like we need to describe the experience of drinking a mimosa but i am excited for this because this is better than drinking whiskey at nine in the morning or whatever time it is um so what do we want to talk about today building hype building hype how do you build hype on the internet okay in the context of mischief on the contract yeah let's talk let's talk michelle cheers man cheers oh that's delicious okay all right mischief what is it mschf for those at home what is mischief so i think they've been doing it a group out of new york been doing it probably for three four years yeah 2016 they got founded 2016. they've done about 90 drops and they come up with ideas for how to create hype yeah um and sell some stuff so what is it is it a collective like is it a creative agency like how do you even define it so you've seen some of their stuff yeah like you saw would you see jesus shoes was a big one yeah let's actually talk about a couple of those things so they became really well known it's his former buzzfeed employee gabriel wally or whaley starts this thing in 2016. they're like the island of misfit they didn't want to fit in they didn't want to do anything the normal way and they started building this insane credibility and hype via these crazy drops and they were all viral so they did this jesus shoe that you just mentioned which was literally a nike shoe and they had taken water from the river jordan and put it into the sole of the shoe and they sold it like what did they do a thousand of them or something there was like very few pairs they marketed it it went totally viral sold all of them out then they had the little nazaks yup um satan's shoe which was from his music video montero and they put like drops of blood in the soul of these guys i mean it was crazy it was completely nuts but went totally viral had a lawsuit with nike because nike was like we didn't allow you to use our shoes to do this they have this product you know a voluntary product recall which was like you can give your shoes back if you want but no one did all these celebrities are wearing them they did the guns to swords that was really cool they like if you traded in your guns you could get them melted down converted into a sword and returned to you and like grimes took one of those swords on the red carpet was all around so they do this insane insane product drop stuff and they sell out immediately and there's unbelievable virality around it and did you see their they're resawing what was the reason with the andy warhol oh yeah let's talk about this because it relates to nfts too it's like a similar concept tell them um so andy warhol the artist um they bought a piece an andy warhol original for twenty thousand dollars one it's like uh we'll post it online it's a basically like a pencil drawing i mean i'm not an art savant but it looks like a pencil drawing to me and they bought this piece and they went and created 999 identical forgeries of it and they like documented the whole process you know the pencil drew it out they like aged the paper made it all look exactly the same removed any trace of what the original was they like put it into the stack with the 999 forgeries and then they sold a thousand mischief forgeries basically for 250 a piece so they had bought the original piece for 20 grand and then they made 250 grand on selling these thousand forgeries immediately and that's the cool thing about mischief is if you go to their website which is it's actually a really cool website um they every single one of their drops has a bunch of press so like the warhol thing had a bunch of press it was everywhere jesus shoes had a bunch of press it was everywhere like everything they do like they reverse engineer getting coverage yeah uh like on on blogs and stuff like that yeah and i think that's a really interesting way of like building a startup or or building a company or building a product which is okay what a what what can i build so that people will will write about it so i'll give you an example yeah uh april 2020 quarantine you know uh covet is already happening for a month two months now people's hair hair was getting long so uh we created like checkout created a website called you probably need a haircut and it was this way that it paired you up with virtual barbers okay to cut your hair okay and it guided like you know your wife would you know it would be a face time with like a barber in in new york and and and she's cutting your hair and she's like telling you how to do it telling uh he's telling her how to do it like this cut like that yeah and it went completely viral okay um you know today's show you know on fox abc real viral real viral like tens of millions of wow of visits and views and stuff like that and and we built it in under four hours yeah you know from conceptualization to to building it in under four hours yeah and what's the realization like what was the insight you had there is it just that like in the modern viral digital age hype is the ultimate currency what what mischief understands really well is that when you understand culture you could create products around culture so at the time with you probably need a haircut everyone like the cultural vibe was like oh my hair is getting long i'm growing up my hair everyone was just kind of talking about their hair and you couldn't get a haircut so we were like okay let's let's come up with like an interesting like viral name you probably need a haircut.com and build something around that yeah um so to me like the future of marketing is around drops yeah like you probably need a haircut like mischief yeah um and it's all we and it's about reverse engineering these you know cultural moments yeah that you can you know that you can create these products around it and the best part about it is that in software i mean it's harder to go and create you know get blood and put it into a shoe but with this whole world we live in where no code it you know is a thing and you can go and just build a website you don't have to know how to code yep and piece things together uh there's just a lot of opportunity just to come up with interesting viral ideas yeah slap it together yeah i think what you're hitting on is something that i've thought about a lot it's like the framework i have around it is it's like the modular economy i don't know what the right way is to talk about it or call it but that's kind of how i think about it which is basically if you have if you can create hype and you can create that buzz and you know that you can kind of build that and stoke that you have all of the tools necessary to go and build a business that is highly profitable from day one and i think it's funny because like mischief we've talked about this they raised venture money which i i actually just don't really get i don't really understand why they went and raised venture because they seemed so anti-normal establishment and so like the idea of raising money maybe they needed it for some of these things i mean maybe the processes around like replicating these things light aging them and doing all that maybe it's expensive and maybe like the net profits on these i don't know i mean on that one it was 20 grand to buy the warhol they made 250 and gross profit on it but like maybe there was a bunch of costs that sit in the middle of that that i don't know about so you need money because you're lost making but if you can do you could start a business today and say like in clothing if you have a designer like someone that can design a really cool product you could do a limited drop of like a thousand of something or 100 of something if you had a designer someone that understood distribution so maybe they have a big audience or maybe they um you know just understand how to go through different marketing channels drive virality and then an ops person basically just someone to like do the back end of getting it but you can do these things now in a very easy way and just like sell out before you actually go buy the inventory and that's the brilliance of it yeah that's why i don't know why they raise venture so what like i actually do do you know the story of why they did i have no idea they raised from founders fund and a few i know they raised like at least you know at least five million dollars yeah to me it's like you're building i i you know i didn't get the pitch yeah but i imagine like the pitch was something like we're we're building a brand like supreme that's internet native yeah um around drops and stuff like that yeah um which i totally get but what i don't get is just do drops that are profitable yeah like just make money on your drops yeah and use that money to fuel the business yeah it's hard to scale coolness this is like another framework right like i mean elon musk to go back to elon musk has somehow managed to scale intrigue and coolness to an insane level and it's never going to end in that way but like supreme i don't think of is quite as cool as it used to be where i think to me it's authenticity yeah like elon musk how old is elon musk 45 i don't know making up a number 45 50. okay so let's say he's 50 years old yeah like i feel like elon musk of as a 50 year old today is the same elon musk yes 25 and he's just but his audience is you know a thousand you know 10 000 50 000 times bigger yeah 50 or millions of times bigger right so he's scaling he's just scaling himself and he's being authentic um supreme you can argue lost its authenticity over time it started off in new york in skateboarding culture right yeah now does mischief mischief to me seems extremely authentic amazing they've done 90 or so drops 1 through 90 have been super cool and they've been learning and stuff like that but it seems very authentic now what venture does a lot of the time is it takes you from being inauthentic sorry authentic what venture does a lot of the time it takes you from being authentic to inauthentic because when you have the venture influences you to grow grow at all costs yeah and when you grow at all costs you have to compromise yeah sometimes yeah you do different things you make different decisions and i mean to their credit so first off i've talked to the guys at mischief they're amazing and they are very different and they think differently about all this stuff but it's a um it's a different vibe the people they raise money from to their credit like founders fund thinks differently about venture versus others and so maybe they're able to continue to bottle it up and scale it but these drops are insane so cool yeah i mean we honestly we should bring them on the pod yeah i would love to i'd love to we'll get them on to a future episode we'll talk about some of their drops but one thing i wanted to do because we have a guest today who understands hype and has done a really good job building hype around you know what's kind of like a niche consumer product in beds and sleep and he built out in front of a completely changing consumer perception for lack of a better way to put it no one really cared about sleep five ten years ago it wasn't cool it was like hustle culture was in its prime and it wasn't cool and so mateo founder of eight sleep um super interesting they're building around sleep science and they're building this hype wave in front of people actually caring about it at scale and so i want to bring him in and i want to talk about it with him because i think it'll be really interesting yeah that sounds like a perfect person yeah to talk to let's bring him in all right so we are so excited to welcome in matteo franceschetti did i pronounce that okay yeah yeah we got it mateo is an amazing founder ceo founder of eight sleep we talked about it a little before but completely revolutionizing sleep performance and sleep technology so really excited to have him in to talk about everything hype and consumer and how you build this like amazing amazing company out in front of a changing perception and consumer perception so thank you for coming in no thank you for having me appreciate it to share more so what we were talking about before you joined was we were talking about it in the context of mischief this company that does these amazing product drops and drives all this like crazy intrigue um and marketing hype around their drops and it struck us that you in particular have built something that is like this industry that's not necessarily sexy right mattresses like no one really thinks of mattresses as sexy but you've created this amazing technology overlay and this amazing hype and marketing engine around it so we'd love to just like start there how did you do that what was the insight you had and why did you start there yeah um i mean all the credit honestly goes to my co-founder alexandra she came up with this concept of sleep fitness and i think that is what changed everything right because you start thinking of sleep not like a boring time of your day that is just wasted but like a moment for your body to recover so we always tell everyone that going to bed is like going to the gym you're doing something for your body to recover to stay fit healthy and so she she came up with with this concept of sleep fitness and once we defined that name we started understanding our strategy that is all around athletes top performers and recovery and so now if you look at what we do you know we we have a bunch of athletes there was a major fight in in new york last week and you know the the athlete was is an eight-sleep athlete uh we just signed justin who is the number one crossfitter in the world he just won the crossfit games i think in july and so we are signing athletes and we power their sleep because now they are all educated and knowledgeable enough to know how important sleep is for the recovering performance uh but there is really no other brand that is doing that right you can think of us like a red bull but instead then giving you a drink we give you power through sleep yeah i think what was cool about red bull as a as a business and as a marketing engine was it was super aspirational yep right so they they signed surfers skateboarders um and it's like i wanted to be like one of those people yeah um so it's interesting that you're taking sort of a similar model but applying it to a completely vertical yeah i never thought about that actually the red bull example that you just brought up is a really interesting one mario our friend mario gabriel over the generalists wrote a great piece on red bull a while back about the engine that they've created and it is super fascinating because they do all these things that you just it's not related to energy drinks like they have the formula one team they did the like crazy jump from space that the guy did um the parachute and they're generating so much buzz and hype around something and just around the name brand and so when you bring it up like in the context of athletes you're creating that same hype by having someone that's this crazy high performer all of a sudden talking about sleep and how it changes them because if i mean the first principle is the same is to give you energy right to achieve whatever you want to achieve in your life you could be a mom you could be a doctor you could be an athlete and so actually we are looking at some other sports like you know winter sports and and surfing because the content is really cool these athletes they have a lot of energy they do they now they make the impossible possible and for that to happen you need to have the energy and you need to be fully recovered and that matches our story when you when you when you and the team came up with the idea around or the insight i should say around sleep fitness were you like okay this is going to be huge let's go create you know mattress product or like can you walk us through a bit about how you came up with the idea and and why it you know because i look at i'm like a software guy i look at it like oh my god how does he deal with supply chains how does he deal with um it's hard designing you know it's hard so i'm just curious like how you how you got from a to z so i would say there were almost two phases for us as a company there was phase one there was 2015 to 2017. we launched was the first product it didn't even have cooling so it was more like really a sleep tracker okay uh we sold 8 000 units in pre-orders go to yc i moved to china for a couple of months to build the units but we didn't have sleep fitness at the time and then everything changed when uh um keith akita boys invested in us and so we raise our a um and that is the moment where we decided to substantially rebrand and the money was also used to build the pod which is the current product which is not the the one that now is really ninety percent of our sales and so at the time i have been an athlete all my life keith uh obviously you know he's really into into fitness he's like a thousand day streak of barry's boot camp or something like that right it's crazy on the same they invested together and so i mean we were just speaking the same language and we said this is not a it's not a mattress company at all we don't even have a mattress expert or a film expert but we always and immediately thought of this like you know from a fitness angle then alexandra came up with this word and now looks so simple and obvious but when you have never heard of sleep fitness you never think of matching these two words and we started pitching to people and some people love it some other people were saying does it really make sense but then we started developing the whole brand strategy and then this started looking awesome and we went all in for that yeah it's really interesting when you kind of bring up like how it all played out that way because like i in every industry and in consumer in particular there's always someone doing the same thing and it's like how do you bottle up something much more exciting drive intrigue around it like i remember it's probably 10 years ago now there was this thing called the chili pad that i remember like seeing out there it was like is a pad that had like tubes in it that you could feel and it would put cold water into your bed and it never went anywhere right like it had an insight and there's probably something to it and it helps you sleep but you guys have created something obviously a better product and i love the product i'm a huge fan of it by the way i was talking to greg about it yesterday and just like trying to convince him on it to buy one now but it's something different about the way that you bottled up like coolness alongside this amazing product and science insight that is so intriguing to me when you say coolness do you mean like temperature cool no no no like sexiness around sleep which that that piece of it i think is so amazing because sleep is something that no one has ever thought of as like this sexy fitness thing everything's all about working out you want the like muscles and you go barry's boot camp and all these workout companies but suddenly science started to build up that sleep was actually the most important thing for longevity for your health for the way you have energy on a daily basis but also for how long you're going to live and so it's just interesting because you built out in front of that and you had built this thing and now people are starting to realize it you go listen to some of my favorite podcasts like hubermann or some of these other science podcasts like half their episodes are about sleep and how important it is now so it's pretty yeah and this angle at the beginning was quite controversial even inside the company we we had a lot of people inside the company that they say um but this now is going to be a very small segment it's only about athletes but at a certain point i realized look i mean this is what i like i used to be an athlete so even if you guys really want me to be the face of this company be out there and be passionate about taking a flight to do something it needs to be about something i like and and so that is how we force yeah this thing a little bit and i think now is proving to be not to be successful because it's aspirational right we are making sleep aspirational and it's all about recovery and energy it's the same thing if like i always go back to frameworks but it's the same mental model as what nike did with making athletics yeah aspirational anyone was an athlete like they did that whole brilliant campaign just do it stuff when they first started launching it which was it's not just michael jordan it's not just tiger woods it's not just serena williams or whoever it is it's you it's the normal person on the street getting up and grinding away and going to the drive a truck and wants to go for a walk to be healthier on a daily basis and like that it's almost an emotional reaction that you feel associated with it when you have that feeling where you can take something that was previously only for the elite and suddenly it's applicable to everybody exactly we call them we call all our users everyday athletes yeah and you don't have to be an athlete again you can be a doctor you could be a mom you can be whatever we want to unlock your full potential yeah it doesn't matter what you want to do we want to give you the energy to achieve you know your peak performance and your peak happiness yeah and that starts with sleep right and then there are couples fighting around different temperature uh there are athletes that want to recover faster there are people that are just sleeping hot there are women in menopause that have hot flashes so then the category or or the audience is pretty broad but again and and that is the key thing that we had to really explain internally is it's not that we are for athletes athletes are just the the maximum expression of the energy that we want to give to our now 100 000 200 thousand users but every person is a user exactly like nike nike and so knack is a perfect example for us now companies that we really admire is nike in terms of branding of the peloton um and from a technological standpoint tesla yeah yeah we were talking about elon musk earlier and how he has this unbelievable capacity to create hype um around and he scaled authenticity you said that very well like he has managed to despite how big he's gotten as a person continue to scale the authenticity of tesla and these other things he's building so i think it's a great it's a great example i have to ask you about supply chain stuff because we're in the midst of what is probably a generational disruption to supply chains globally i assume you have asia manufacturing to some extent how are you managing what are like the key things you're focusing on as you try to work through a period of disruption like this is the [ __ ] show um i think that the team is doing a pretty good job i mean at the end of the day the the way we are the simplest the most expensive way for us to fix the problems to airship units which obviously for us is quite problematic because they're big it's not like a wearable right but we are so in in terms of having all the units and all the components we're fine it's just really a problem of catching up with demand because we are seeing a lot of demand on our side plus obviously ocean shipping right now is not really an option with the holidays so we are shipping a lot of units and that is costing a lot of money yeah the hope is that in the second part of december we will be able to switch to ocean shipping again yeah it's a really crazy environment right now because the ocean shipping obviously is the more traditionally the most cost effective air freight somehow has been better for a lot of companies and getting things over and you take the margin hit because you just need to fulfill the orders you guys have the benefit of being direct to consumer is that 99 your business or all of your business and so what i've seen with some of the companies i'm involved with is like the wholesale orders are the hardest part because if you're delayed they just cancel the order and now that's revenue that's gone you're never getting it back for you guys i imagine you own the customer you own the relationship you've built that relationship with them and so if it comes in four weeks versus six weeks people survive and they'll wait until they can get it and you're also building something that there's not really an alternative to you're the only business out there that's really building on the forefront of this yeah i think the only challenge is now with the holidays because that is a hard deadline if it's a gift yeah um we were so in when we are perfect we ship within a week this year multiple times we were shipping within three to four weeks because we couldn't catch up with demand good problem to have yeah a lot of demands yeah now we need to make it on time right for for the holidays uh obviously not the the the port in long beach right now is uh is now getting your units on time more than anything it's really hard to predict when you will get your units and so you have to de-risk and by the risking you fly in units and that is super expensive so that is what we are doing um just to make sure we can respond properly to demand so greg and i have an ongoing discussion and debate that i feel like is a common thread that goes through a lot of these discussions around raising venture capital and raising capital and the process around it and why to do it versus companies that don't necessarily need to do it we talked about it in the context of mischief that company we were talking about earlier that they raised money actually from founders fund as well um and i think keith is probably involved and it doesn't strike us as one where they necessarily had a big need to raise capital in front of it so can you talk a little bit about your thoughts on venture capital why you should raise versus companies that maybe don't need to yeah i mean for us it was not even really an option because you know hardware at least for us when you develop cutting-edge technologies are expensive right there is no way you can do it without raising money i still think if you raise money from the right people uh they are extremely valuable um we there were a couple of things that worked really well for us first obviously you know the ron being led by some of top vcs now from from keith and then trey and now antonio antonio gracias with valor i was the first investor he's fantastic yeah he's fantastic i know him actually quite well personally he's fantastic it's a great group so antonio has been on the board of tesla since 2007 and now he's with us so that type of experience has no no price right another thing that worked really well for us was we raise money from a lot of individuals operators that are extremely valuable now uh patrick and john collison naval uh pomp um and yeah people with big audiences a lot of friends in tech right exactly so then they can open door their doors they can help you with recruiting they just become friends so you can pick their brain as as needed another great investor for us was yc right so we built a very close relationship with them we i also just went through the yc growth program right so that was amazing because you know there are great speakers coming in um or no you just work work with the partners and so they tell you okay the company is reaching a new level and inflection point is what other ceos need so you just need to cherry pick the right people yeah but these people they can connect the value of the business because of the of the knowledge that you transfer yeah could you talk more about your yc experience and how important that was yeah um you know do you recommend people look into it and yeah just a little more color there yeah i would say it was a major inflection point for us we got rejected twice uh yeah i love stories like that yeah yeah you guys kept coming back and now clearly i mean it's a multi-billion dollar business amazing business i love that uh yeah it's a funny story because so we apply we get rejected we reapply we get rejected and so we say okay and then i think a new i mean a new partner specifically for hardware just got higher i i meet him and he says oh you have to apply and i say no i don't want to apply again to be rejected at the same time i have a dignity at certain point you say no you have to apply so i go back and with my co-founders we say do we do it we don't no and we say we do it but we apply within one hour right so we're not gonna waste more than an hour on the thing so if it doesn't work who cares and then we get in but even even after we apply there is a funny story because okay we apply and then if you get selected then you have the in-person meeting okay and you go there they interview for 10 minutes but it's known that to be successful you want to show your product the problem is our product is freaking huge right so we rent a truck with with a bed and a cover but part of the experience was also with lights and other stuff that you know the nest that you were having in your bedroom because it was an iot connectivity so we also bring nightstands and the lights that go on the nightstand and we go to y combinator and in the hallway we substantially build the bedroom so we take the interview i don't think they were really convinced during the interview they were a bit probably skeptical about the opportunity of the business but then like after nine minutes it's a ten minutes interview after nine minutes we say oh come to see the product and they say what do you mean we have the whole mattress right there so you can see it and so they come out and they try the product and i think they were so shocked that we know that we were there with the whole now that we built a bedroom inside y combinator office that probably they said these guys are resourceful enough that it's worth giving them a chance but that was pretty weird because in in this hallway there were all the other founders for now that they were taking interviews but they were there just with their laptop because most of them are software founders and then there were no we were there with our mattress so i love that i love it it's so funny it's like i keep coming back to this whole idea of like variant perception have you ever heard that concept variant perception it's like you have a perception of what the future is going to be like that is different from the consensus and time and time again you see these amazing businesses that have been built basically where a founder had or a founding team had a variant perception of what the future looked like and then they were proven right and this is a classic example of that to me like shopify toby had this variant perception that the future was going to look very different in terms of how people shopped online and that ecommerce was going to take over the world and so he built something that enabled that future at the time when he had the idea no one really was thinking about it and so you capture all the alpha from that because you're the first one to really have that idea and go build something and you guys i see it in the same way of you have this variant perception that sleep is going to become a mainstay and a pillar of people's fitness performance life health etc and you build something out in front of that that trend and so it's a it's a classic example of that to me and it's so cool to see those like pound your head into a wall failures and then it breaks through and you end up kind of having that moment and now you're clearly you know you're at the beginning of your s curve and you're you're starting to see it so it's really exciting i call the same concept you need to be contrarian and right yes that is the only way you can be successful and we are far from being successful but very successful people they were contrarian so they were saying something no one else was seeing but then you also need to be right because just being contrient doesn't mean anything yeah you screw up your decision there are a lot of contrarians out there not all of them are right that is true and remarkable right like i feel like who else is setting up a bedroom in a hallway right who else is sponsoring pro athletes for this particular vertical like you know seth godin the author talks about remarkable being something that you make a remark over and i think that that's the key to great marketing and great storytelling is and and it gets you far in life yeah being willing to do that one thing we want to yeah one thing we always language we always use the with our board was to cut through the noise right because particularly in consumers there is so much noise so you need to do something different or no one is going to pay attention to you and then the other thing that is working well for us is really word of mouth even if our product obvious is kind of expensive right it starts at 1500 but 20 25 percent of our revenues worth of mouth yeah uh so that helped us to scale really fast yeah customer acquisition cost consumer acquisition cost drops uh yeah yeah that's interesting the um the whole idea of like driving word of mouth with consumer businesses and like how did how did you actually do that like how did you bottle that up and kind of try to drive that as a core business strategy honestly it just happened i could try to say that we were super smart yeah i mean i think the way we did it is is because people like the product so at the end of the day is it's product driven so if we deserve any credit because of that it's like in software they talk about um product led growth yeah like the same thing within consumers and i still think there are a lot of tactics that we didn't we are not leveraging yet um that will uh probably accelerate word of mouth yeah but the main concept is on one side probably is also branding so it's what we were saying earlier right people start being proud of having innate sleep like do you have any sleep or no you're missing out yeah right it's a bit like having a tesla obviously on a small scale yeah but there is not that kind of connection with the device then on the other side we are solving a problem right we are improving your sleep if you sleep hot we are helping with that if you are fighting with your partner like 50 of the couples we are helping with that and so it starts becoming a very easy conversation when people have like dinner with friends and they start talking about the device and the other thing we did we we we focus uh we call it concentration right so because it's not an impulsive purchase and so what we do is we try to focus on specific communities and try to um dominate the community right and that is kind of happening in tech where now if you go on twitter everyone talks about eight sleep and so that is driving a lot of word of mouth instead then just being a drop in the ocean in many different places i call it narrative domination you just dominate the narrative around the community but it's it's so interesting for sleep in particular because with a tesla you bring up the example of tesla it's a physical status signal because you see me in it i drive around i don't drive around my bed you don't see me when i walk around the street or like even nfts now you can have it as your profile picture it's like a physical manifestation a status signal that you can put out into the world with a bet it's much more difficult so you really do have to perform above and beyond so that people do naturally want to talk about it with people i think that's that's fine that's the challenge yeah it is it's an it's a really uh it's an interesting challenge um well this was awesome i i know we're uh we're running up against the end of time before you leave i gotta ask one question because i live in miami you live in miami not far from here yeah how how has the city of miami been supportive of the business and are you happy that you live here yeah i love it i used to be in new york and then we moved here now probably a year and a half ago so we were really early um but i love it because first not the tech community right now in miami it's great it seems to be in san francisco in 2015 right so i play tennis with friends in tech i have dinner tonight with you guys and a bunch of other friends in tech you know so um that was probably my biggest fear when i moved here no a sort of fomo well instead what happened immediately after now i was so lucky there are more people here in tech than than there used to be new york yeah but then at the same time you live in a beautiful place where i can play tennis i can do some sports sometimes i wake up early i go running at the beach and then i can keep pushing during the day to build the business yeah it's amazing to see what mayor suarez has done in terms of fostering the tech community here and i know keith has been a huge proponent of miami tech and bringing people in and it is really cool i mean in a short period of time here i'm spending time with more amazing ceos and founders than in any other city i've been to i was in san francisco for 12 years i now live in new york and i'm down here and i can feel the energy of it so it is very very cool to see yeah i mean for me i was living in new york too before when i moved to miami my stress levels just went down yeah and it's similar to like when you have a good night's sleep too right yeah you have a good night's sleep unlocks creativity good things happen when you're like when your stresses yeah sunlight like the weather like yeah i feel like it's a good situation to be very creative yeah and then there is also a secondary order effect where even if certain people don't live here right now everyone is visiting let's say really november to may and people start knowing maybe you know that we are here yeah and so they ping you and so these people if you were flying to san francisco some of these big guys they would never meet you because they're super busy but when they come to miami then they want to meet as many people as possible right and so you have the chance to meet them right and so there are ceos of public companies that came here they are sleeping on the pod and so maybe they ping me and say oh mateo i'm in miami yeah and i had the chance to meet them which would have never happened before amazing amazing i love it well i'm long miami so i'm looking forward to coming back here thank you so much for spending the time with us this has been a blast thank you for having cheers and where can people find you guys 8sleep.com and the pod is the pod pro yep and it comes as a cover or as a mattress or you can retrofit any mattress you have with our cover or if you're just looking for a

personal sleep so i appreciate you thank you thank you thank you guys awesome that was an awesome conversation with mateo absolutely loved it what did you have for your one big takeaway my big takeaway was be remarkable if you're creating a product if you're creating a drop you're creating marketing you need to be remarkable to cut the noise yeah i love that i loved when you brought that up in the seth godin quote for me it was variant perception like this whole idea that you get paid for having a different view of what the future is going to look like and then being proven right like the whole thing i think matteo said it of being contrarian and then correct um i really loved that and i came away with that so what do you think we can get into the community and uh hammer around with i feel like we've got a lot of smart people in the community yeah and i actually think we've got a lot of contrarian people in the community so i want to know what so what sort of contrarian ideas that you can share that we potentially could work on together yeah uh so just share it in the discord yeah so let's jump in the community after this episode drops we're gonna get in there with you let's bat around some ideas contrarian views of the future that we think are going to be proven right let's jump onto that and we're looking forward to it we'll see you in there contrarian right

use code room at checkout to get 20 off any order of 75 or more i need to i feel like kick this off by telling the story of why we are all sitting here because it is very uh i don't know i think it's very telling of like the era that we live in and also it's a really interesting story about you and about your personality the type of person you are um and it's really for me at least personally the reason why i'm sitting here in the first place and so scott and i met and i don't think you know this story either so it's a good one um back in like may of 2020 kovit had hit world was on fire there was like you know everything was [ __ ] disaster at the time like i think the markets the markets had probably recovered by then but like world was in chaos everyone was unemployed like [ __ ] was hitting the fan and i wrote this thread and i had like i had 500 followers on twitter at the time threads weren't really a thing yet and i like sat on my garage floor had this idea of like how to try to explain basically why the markets were soaring while the economy was in the [ __ ] and so i write this thing and i post it and like not much happens and then i dm'd it to scott and i just seen him on twitter he had big following i think you had like 100 thousand followers at the time maybe just under that yeah and um i dm'd it to him not expecting anything and then suddenly like my phone is [ __ ] blowing up and i look and scott has like quote retweeted this thing angel you're an angel and i'm like losing my mind texting all my friends like dude this is insane this guy just retweeted me this is nuts i'm you know i've like gained 250 followers in 10 minutes and um basically then so you know that tweet kind of blew up and then what happened over the next six months was like the remarkable part and it says a lot about scott but basically as i was like starting to kind of create more and write and share um for no reason other than just being a good guy scott was like my patron saint he would like share everything i was doing with his big and fast growing audience at the time um and basically took me along for the ride with him and so it was like this really cool thing where um you know i'd met someone through the internet like we had never met in person actually right now as we're sitting here oddly enough is the first time we've ever met in person but we would talk every single day um i was helping with some of the stuff scott was working on on the business side as he was growing his empire and here we are today and he's been like you know if i could point to one person that was most influential in getting me to where i am it's scott and so it's a very cool thing for me to be able to like sit here now i went on his podcast and it was like the first podcast i had been on and i remember being really nervous being like do you really want to have me on this i only have 10 000 followers can you remember me saying that i was like scott that this isn't good for you you've got a big following i've got like ten thousand dollars i'm some random guy and i went on it so now it's kind of a thrill for me to be able to sit here and turn the mic around a little bit and uh and talk to you that's amazing i wouldn't have even described it that way which is funny i would say that yeah how would you describe it chamath retweeted that that thread that's that's how i remember who was first i actually don't remember i thought you were i think i might have been first and then it kind of went a bit viral and then it got to him through no doing of my own and then he retweeted it but listen i think it's a testament to the fact that especially in this era like good content rules everything right and so it was not hard to identify the fact that you had written this incredible accessible thread on a very complicated topic which you made seem very easy it was the story of federico who yeah mr federica mr federico the fed of course i i i remember it almost word for word because it was so compelling and you focused in on that and continued to do that it was impossible not to share the content that you made because you know i think the ethos of a lot of what many of us do is we want to take complicated topics and make them more simple because they're important and people need to understand what's actually happening around them and you launched that sort of 101 thread series where it was like the fed put nobody knows what the fed put is options you know all these very uh complex target uh topics that don't really need to be that complex yeah it is like it's a story of web three too which is what i love about it in that um a lot of the things we talk about on this show is like the openness of it it's like borderless doesn't matter whether you're the country club kid from greenwich connecticut or if you're the kid growing up in india if you're creating great things if you're creating great artwork in the context of the things we're seeing this week if you're creating great content it can be shared and you can reach people and it was a cool case study of that but it's cool to see the people and it's inspiring when you're on the ground to see you know when you're like just getting started to see the people like where you were at the time who had already made it in my mind i know you probably didn't think that but like i felt that way i don't to yeah none of us do right like i'm sitting here i don't feel that way and other people probably do and so it was so cool to see like that positive sum ethos that i think characterizes a lot of crypto and web 3 that people haven't really appreciated yet like outside looking in people still look at crypto web 3 and they're like oh scam fraud whatever but there's so much positivity and willingness to kind of embrace share and grow the space that is happening within it 100 and i think that that's such an external perception and this couldn't be further off as you said from what's happening internally it's funny i just on my way here stopped at my friends they're music producers at their studio hadn't seen them since i lived in miami want to hang out and they were talking about man we're really starting to embrace this like nft and crypto producer thing people actually help each other it's not like the music industry where everybody's [ __ ] on each other all the time right and you know my background um like i went to an ivy league school and was going to go the finance route yeah you got to tell you know i went to the university of pennsylvania and i decided to be a dj basically the gist of it with a thousand twists and turns in between but i was a guy who like got an ivy league degree threw it away and decided to go dj clubs downtown in philadelphia you know i'm very very proud i'm sure my parents were at the time although they were always very supportive of it but you know the music industry is quite literally the opposite everybody is for themselves nobody wants to help each other anyone you do business with is gouging you at every possible turn and it really is not like that in the crypto industry it is the first time i've been a part of anything and that's web 3 in general not not not cryptos per se where it really feels like you're on a team and everybody's winning together right it's like being at the craps table and and you know everybody's cheering and of course you have that one guy who's on the don't pass line who you hate but you know and but but the other nine people at the table are cheering they're winning together and it's sort of how i feel being in this in this industry so i i think you're absolutely right and i think the team is worldwide right it's not even just 10 years ago it would have been like the people you could assemble around you in your town or in your like you know some sort of social media group or something now it's everyone everywhere yeah and uh and we're just scratching the very very basic surface so not to derail the conversation but i just realized we've met before we have we have met before yeah so you stole my girlfriend this is going to be awkward no you're married okay so i'm trying to remember the place where we met but we met in gainesville florida which is where that makes perfect sense that makes sense okay um sam tarantino okay do you know santa tarantino yes so okay so he started a company called group shark okay do you remember group shark i think he introduced us is that possible that distinctly possible if you were in gainesville florida and you met a guy that looks like who is a dj who threw away his ivy league degree and there's like they're like yeah yeah you have a group chat with the three of us there's right hey guys yeah it's like a group therapy session but yeah yeah i think you're doing all right i remember group shark well so that that makes perfect sense see a small world yeah yeah it's so cool too because it's like the the thing that i find so fascinating about this like we're here you know it's our puzzle week and there's a lot of cool stuff going on um but it's so it's such an eclectic group of people like in in tech i lived in san francisco in the bay area for a long time not anymore luckily but there it's like it's only really one type of person and it gets a bad rep for that but it's like a lot of the tech bro is like what it gets a rap for when you come to the web three world it really isn't eclectic you know there's musicians there's artists micah is a great example like a baseball player turned artist turned nft extraordinary turn ip you know like maven uh it's such an amazing diverse group of talents and people that are coming together in this like really awkward mishmash and it makes sense right if you're over like 35 years old you're not native right right you didn't grow up with it but i i still didn't get my first cell phone until my senior year of college and i was like the first guy and it was one of those big bricks and people thought i was scarface or from night at the roxbury yeah that's what i was going to say nut at the rocks but i think that that's the reason right all these other industries even tech to a degree because silicon valley is an 80s thing right as much as it evolved into what it was the silicon valley already had its core i think everybody's sort of figuring it out together and came to it through some other uh channel right so that's why you get you get the ex-athletes who are now painters like mike as we sort of mentioned below before that the ex-dj who turned traitor who became an enthusiast and you have people from every single walk of life who were sort of either successful but didn't find what they were looking for in whatever they were doing previously or aged out i would say you know you may have aged out of sports i age certainly aged out of djing looking for a second act and you know investing is a powerful second act for quite a few people and if you can do that in a market like this it's pretty compelling but i really think that's the reason is because nobody has that like i've been here for 40 years mentality yeah i failed out of sports for what it's worth i don't know i mean at some point i was just bad so sorry i'm just i'm remembering now so i'm still stuck okay so i like no because you're even in gainesville already yeah exactly right so when i met you it must have been 2017 or something i don't remember you saying crypto i don't remember you you might have been like doing it on the side but correct i don't remember you having a big twitter following is this something that's new-ish for you relatively new so i i mean i joined twitter before bitcoin was invented right i've been there since basically the video i think 2008 or 2009 i joined twitter whenever it started and it was because of music right i was a music account i got my blue check that everyone thinks is from crypto because of my djing and music production so uh i rode that maybe i had 40 000 followers come 2016 and 17 had a kid decided i didn't want to you know be on the road anymore didn't want to tour as i said i got older it's always the joke like matthew mcconaughey and dazed and confused you know i felt like uh i get older they stay the same age that's how i felt with djing like no matter how old i get everyone i'm djing force 21 and wants to party right it just didn't really work um and so you know i'd been trading already i loved trading i loved markets um and crypto was this sort of world of unicorn 100x pumps in late 2016 and early 2017 and i just timed it well right a huge part of i think anyone's story in this industry is certainly luck and timing right if i had this exact same story at the very beginning of 2018 it would be very different right um so i did well fast i became very passionate about it and i immediately alienated everyone who followed me on twitter like one day it was like i've got this show come to south by southwest whatever and the next day it was like check out this chart of bitcoin like right and people and back then my charts were hideous lines all over the place and uh and so i immediately like cut my followers in half right are you really lonely followers oh i lost like i became a completely and utterly different thing and if you were following me for like new music releases why would you follow me when i'm starting to talk about internet magic which is pretty courageous and there's not that many people honestly that do that i feel like jack butcher did that a little bit when he got into web 3 he was he was tweeting about like design exclusively and then all of a sudden he was just like hard pivot no i don't think it was intentional i think uh you know i'm like a vicious adhd case and when i get super like into something i know people say adhd gives you like makes you [ __ ] but for me it's a hyper focus thing almost like an obsession so i just talk about what i'm into and that was what i was into so my twitter account had gone through like probably weird twists and turns throughout but there was nothing intentional about it zero expectation that i would gain followers because of it right i was just talking about what i was into and what's social media for if not to share what you're passionate about at that very moment i view it as sort of like a timeline of my life right um and for whatever reason you know people started to engage with it and it built again from there and at a certain point i think it's just the snowball gets bigger and starts heading downhill and you you know it's a sort of a big fish small pond probably scenario to some degree and it just snowballed out of control but that's very likely that i was probably talking about it superficially on twitter but not actually in person and i was still like sort of on the downturn of djing taking the few good things here and there and figuring out what i wanted to do with my life that's what i remember i remember you coming back to gainesville and you were basically like yeah man like like that's why i think we connected because you we want you know you're kind of like yeah i'm i'm trying to figure out what i want to do with my life yeah and so now i look at it i'm like at four yeah but i remember i remember like before you you know that's the first time we're re-meeting yeah um but sahil was like this guy scott's coming he's like the man i checked your twitter account i was like whoa this is like amazing content and like it felt like you were the statue you know this sort of like you've been you know you're you've been doing this for 10 years right but nobody has well there's a few people who have but i think that uh that's what's funny about social media yeah right so i guess that's one of the lessons i'm kind of picking up which is like there's a few lessons actually one is um it's amazing how quick you can rise um yeah with consistent yeah daily i'm looking at both of you i'm like you know it you can't do it alone you can't do it alone and you had mentors people that yeah people that helped me and like i said this kind in this community and sort of this web 3 and tech community people get it and they share your content it can go viral very fast and it's funny i'd gone viral for all these random things before in my life massively viral like one of them was a inflatable tube man that looked like he was twerking and i put it to a migos song called hannah montana got like you know 40 or 50 million views didn't do anything for me right i had music projects that i had that went viral i went viral for writing a story on my facebook page about donald trump jr when we went to college together which was screenshot and became national news right still to this day if you search your name i think it's like the first thing that comes up on google miami dj says donald trump jr right yeah um and so but none of that ever stuck or was to any benefit to me in fact some of it was probably damaging right um but because there was no i think thought behind it and no meaning and it wasn't connected right and now when you sort of get this narrative like you have you defined yourself as this specific thing like i'm going to teach people complicated topics in a simple manner for me it was like i want everyone in the world to know about bitcoin right i want and and and that's how it started but whatever manifestation of that became web 3 nfts d5 play to earn gaming all the things that that's become but in 2016 it was like there's so much money to be made here you guys got to jump on this boat right and and that was a very simplistic and unfortunate view probably at that time uh and it took a bear market i think for a lot of us to become very passionate about it you know you have to justify the reason that you're still here um but i think you know when you sort of uh put that all together and you start to go viral for things it actually builds into something real that people could sort of engage with it's very easy to be a one-hit wonder i think yeah the consistency that was what i admired about what you were doing there were a couple things i mean number one i said it earlier like the positive sum mentality of it and being willing to help other people just as you got help along the way is like just amazing and it's something that i now try to embody when there are people that are contacting me or reaching out to me is like i want to help because i got a lot of help along the way and it's a good ethos on life the other one is the consistency of the efforts it's just like daily pounding your head into a wall and not everything goes viral not everything scales you the like 10 000 followers and you jump but it's that like consistency of effort day in and day out pounding your head into a wall that eventually you break through and you were a great example of that because you just i mean you've been relentless like as long as i've known you and you've had to deal with crypto twitter still has like a dark side and there's a lot of anonymous accounts and there's people that attack and like say negative things and you have your family on there it's a long and nonsensical story but if you ask certain people i'm the reason that i think the entire crypto market crashed may but uh obviously obviously not the case but you know that people it was a very uh interesting and uh surprising example of how fast fake news can go when people want to believe it you know and i think that there's obviously an element always of trying to tear people down uh who are successful and i'm one of the few people who's non-anonymous in the in the yeah you have your face very very and your wife very nice target you know yeah i i over share certainly for someone who's in crypto which uh is probably not the not the best thing you know you have to deal with the dark sides of it but yes for sure and so i you know like uh i've definitely dealt with uh some some crazy stuff you know it it turned into a lot of sim swapping and hacking uh people attempting to you know i mean i've been hacked so many times at this point it's hard to count but you know people threatening me and trying to you know extort money from me saying that they have information which they don't you know but it's like literally endless um it's calmed down a bit it goes with the market you know up and down but as you said it's it's the dark side but i choose not to focus on that as like painful and brutal as those experiences are they're temporary right and i think it's a very interesting sort of exploration of human nature how how much the negative stands out over the positive if you if you could redo it all it's 2017 when we met and start your twitter account fresh anonymous account i think on your twitter title it says like the wolf of all streets maybe you call it the wolf of all streets would you do would you start it anonymous or would you be scott again i would be myself and without without question although like i envy the guys who are anonymous to some degree because they're i think it's just an easier way to interact with this particular community i wouldn't change a thing because like i feel like everything i've done is uniquely me you know and i think that maybe that's why it's funny they say you know it takes 20 or 30 years to become an overnight success but for myself i think that that's the case that i just found enough people who like either enjoy my content or like my personality or just see something of myself and then whatever that is i found enough of those people that it created a community that allowed it to be what it is and i don't think that would be the case if i was hiding behind a cartoon and i don't blame anyone for doing that honestly i don't begrudge them that at all just i don't think it would have ever worked for me i'm just too much of an over sharer i've been that way since i was a little kid so i could just well you're also like i mean you're a dj you're an entertainer there was no like yeah and so what if i was gonna change the face of my twitter account and all of a sudden i'm not a dj i'm like a wolf avatar you know i just don't think uh well i mean it's in your nature right like your nature when you play a show i also have friends who are musicians and comics and stuff like that like they thrive on putting their face out there connecting with the audience and having that interaction you're the man in the arena the funniest thing though i think the first time that i had an attempted cancelling on twitter was because a huge name in the twitter industry in the crypto twitter space i should say said that i had bought my account from a dj like killed a dj in buzz again i had like bought my blue check i was not verified it went wildly viral and i was like it's literally like i share pictures of myself my wife my kids it's the same guy like this is the most easily vetted fake news story in history and went crazy viral and i hear about it every single day three years later that's actually amazing yeah yeah but i bought my twitter account that it's not real that that i'm buying my followers like people just for some reason nobody wants to believe people don't like people there's always going to be a subset that of people that hate success and they they would prefer to we talked about this we talked about this like right before so we we just um we just interviewed jiho from axi infinity and he shared a picture of us all of us because we you know we're on the pod and like 95 of it was super positive but five percent of it was like really negative but that's the part those are the comments you're gonna remember and that was the point i was making to go circle back to what we were saying for whatever reason in the human psyche the negative comments weigh 100 times heavier than the positive ones yeah always right i can remember what someone said about my kids my wife or my mom and can't remember the 900 people who said wow you really changed my life with this idea or whatever you know that that for some reason that starts to wash kind of wash out but the negative ones and the negative experiences listen that's something you can like rationally sort through but i think your knee-jerk reaction is always to have an emotional sort of response to that negativity totally that's why you probably don't remember me i was probably really nice yeah yeah you're way too nice too man you got to be more of a dude you were praising this you were crazy can we talk i mean one of the things that's really interesting here too is like the overlay of all of this um of creator economy and all of the different cool monetization opportunities that exist within this creator world and you in particular and i'm kind of experiencing this now and i learned a lot from watching you do this it was like you know you've kind of consistently grown your sphere of creator work while also being actually like skin in the game and man in the arena on the investing side which by the way is like no small thing because a huge knock for a long time on like creators or like inspirational speakers or whatever was oh they're making money off of selling courses to you not off of doing the thing that they're teaching you to do and so you have your money where your mouth is like you're showing trading charts in your newsletter but you're actually putting skin in the game and making money on these trades and so it's different in that in that case which i i really do respect but can you talk about like the different things you've gone into i know you have you know podcasting newsletter the different stuff and like how you've thought about monetizing those things over time and and how that's scaled it's interesting i would love to say that it was intentional and you'll remember when we met i do i came to you to help give me some advice on scaling it as a business because that was never my approach i need that same advice now by the way um you know because uh it started as a guy tweeting you know and as i said there was no intention of becoming i didn't even know you could be a personality in the crypto space right i was literally following all the guys in the crypto space like a fanboy you know all these people i looked to them for advice and and somehow transitioned into that but it started as a twitter account one day i was like listen i like my tweets are all over the place i need a forum where i can speak in long form right and so i started a newsletter and it was the intention of the newsletter was going to be twice a week right it was only twice a week and it was just going to be all the thoughts i had had on twitter basically hashed out into longer ideas you know did you do it with review when you started i started immediately with review and it was free twitter acquisition here's an og yeah yeah preview game yeah and i think i can't speak but i think at one point i'm one of their two or three probably largest newsletters just because i started really in their infancy um and man there was a lot of pressure to go sub stack i'm not gonna lie yeah um but so i yeah i went with review i just i like the way they displayed my charts better and it just seemed like an easier interface i was really more of it than the business and so that started to sort of catch fire as a free newsletter and then became a job right my intention was just to put out more comment content and then one day i was like man i'm spending like 30 hours a week writing a newsletter at that time wow yeah and i was like i need to you know so i started charging 15 a month but kept the free issue so okay stop there just i'm fascinated about this so while you're doing this like did you have another job was this your full time you know you're like i mean i made the money trading and investing so you're like your full-time job is essentially trading investing your passion is putting your thoughts out there in the world is that correct correct when i started the newsletter i thought maybe maybe one day there'll be enough people who want to read this that i could somehow monetize it but i've never felt overly comfortable with monetizing my audience i have no problem monetizing a sponsor or a company that wants to support what i'm doing but i never wanted the money necessarily from the people but it became this challenge i was like i want to do this more i want to do this five days a week which was something that you know you were part of uh transition saying this it should you know say maybe we should be doing more content and so i started to charge the 15 but still kept the free issue just less frequently and that was a that was basically a decision you made saying i need to have the value for my time because i'm spending so much time on this it i need to feel like i kind of expect you to be a charitable giver when you have an audience but there's a certain point where you know time is money of course so i felt like fifteen dollars you know for five day at the time two days a week but transitioning to five was about as like fair as i could possibly offer and then i met the guys at block works jason janowitz randomly dm'd me on twitter so when i tell you there was no intention i mean there was no intention he said you should think about doing a podcast my response was what's a podcast they didn't know was that a thing where like you're not on tv but you're talking right i've never listened to a podcast literally in my life they didn't know what a podcast was either by the way i just had dinner with them and it was hilarious they just got 30 under 30 for black works it's cool very cool business they're awesome guys and he was telling me the story of blackworks and he was like we started these podcasts and we literally like pomp asked them like hey can you guys do podcasting and they were just like [ __ ] yeah sure we can do podcasting and then they were like googling what what is a podcast like how do you produce a podcast and now it's a 20 million plus business yeah and so i never you know really and so i it's amazing brutally horrifying to listen back to my first attempts at podcasting because you'd think i would have gone and listened to a few before i started as well but now in my normal manner i was just like it'll be fine go on with it my first one was catherine coley who at the time was the uh ceo of binance us and i like did all this prep you know and and all the questions and now i do my podcasts like this right i have my my assistant does prep they're guests that i generally know and i feel like i know this person by the time i start let's just have a conversation and see where it goes but so the podcast was sort of the next iteration i guess and then i was like wow podcasts don't come out that often i need to like engage with my audience more directly and i started a youtube channel where i could start live streaming and obviously the podcast go up there and that has just sort of become its own its own beast and i don't know how like the guys who like youtube hardcore it's it's it's it's a serious thing do those get monetized separately like so the largest sponsor they're not monetized every once in a while a company will come and say listen we want to like sponsor you know three months of a stream you're doing or something but like i said i did not start youtube with the intention of making more money i figure that will come um so the newsletter you know at its core has one sponsor that's been there from the very beginning in an exchange called femex and the the paid subscribers and then you know the podcast up to six uh sponsors at any given time two days a week but i that it was the same feeling i had with the newsletter i was like this podcast comes out two times a week sometimes the conversations i've had i feel like are already outdated crypto moves so fast so fast you know and if i make the mistake of actually talking markets with someone like we could be in a bear market or a bull market a week later and what we've talked about is already irrelevant so i wanted something that was sort of not just written and more accessible where i could engage with people and that's how i moved to youtube so it was sort of just just natural i think evolution and then then i realized i was like working yeah i mean you double shipped full-time job right at that time you had yeah you had fought like i mean it's insane if you follow him and you're on his newsletter which i am like i get a newsletter every single [ __ ] day by the way with like by seven days long by seven a yeah by seven amusement by the way like when i was on when i was on the west coast it was hilarious because i would get it at four like i'd wake up and i would get it at 4am and he was like the only person that somehow got me an email before i got up because i'm an early riser but literally like a newsletter super long with detailed charts and analysis every single day you get like two podcasts a week yeah two podcasts a week youtube lives like almost every day he was like the hardest working guy in crypto and no one was really talking about just like the amount of output that was coming out of this engine especially for the fact that it was quite literally just you i mean i have a team but like as far as like being the the face of it it's definitely just me i mean i get up at 4 30 every single morning five days a week monday through friday so that i can get the newsletter out ahead of my kids right because i then i missed her mom uh and i get them up breakfast get them to school come back do a live stream every single day wow uh at 9 30 or 10 o'clock in the morning now wait sorry i'm stopping right there so by 9am by lunch i've worked if you count kids as work and i think that's yeah put this way the weekends are a lot harder than the week right i've got my first kid on the way so this is what i'm looking forward to no it's great um it's terrific everybody have kids and uh lots of them uh but yeah i mean by by 10 30 in the morning when i finish my first live stream i've been full bore for six hours like relentless unstopping because i you know i write the newsletter in the morning uh which is long i have help from my assistant who like will prep some of the news and things like that and then the minute i'm back from dropping my kids off i get with my youtube producer who sends me like all the content we're gonna do for that show and then i have to do all the diligence obviously and read everything and know what the hell i'm gonna talk about it's usually like 10 stories i do the morning stream then usually i record a podcast within the next two hours and then usually i go live again at 1 30 um with another hour-long ish live stream that's like three days a week um and none of that even includes any of my market work uh investments trading any of it and honestly like most of it's unpaid youtube crazy like it's not like ever i've never had a sponsor on my everyday morning live streams i just do it because it's it's fun you're like a one-man crypto cnbc man you're like it's like non-stop he's got squawk box and then he's got like the next thing in the day fast money and i love it i love it i listen when i when i get sick of it i slow down yeah like well you've always been good about that which it's a i feel like it's a common theme that comes up with people we've talked to which is super high achievers people that have achieved incredible success but that have all a common thread i've found at least you should tell me if you disagree have found some way to be able to like pull back and when they need to they're able to like kind of withdraw and recharge and i do feel like you've been able to do that like you've been posting more about like playing golf every now and then which just made me happy because i always knew like when you were getting burned out just as a friend yeah um when you just felt like oh man you're gonna try it now i'm like yeah is that why you took up golf like is so i played golf in high school um that i quit for 25 years and took it up again six weeks ago and it was yeah it was intentional my wife also works exceptionally hard we live in gainesville florida there's not much to do let's go play golf um of course i played golf too much and now i'm injured in every single part of my 45 year old age aged body um but yeah it was it was to force me out of the house so like even if it was just go you know hit balls for 45 minutes after that morning live stream to kind of reset for the afternoon it was great activity but i'll tell you like having children naturally slows you down to some degree i'm not saying it's not very fast pace but like if you put your phone down and spend the evening or the morning with your kids or an hour in the afternoon you you it's pretty easy to detach and to focus on whatever insanity is going on through their little brains at that moment uh and so i think uh that becomes naturally easier as you get older because it's almost forced like you don't have a choice your kids need to eat you know yeah you gotta take care of that can we can we talk about um talk about trading like it's one it's it's an underlying thing in everything you're doing is um trading technical analysis charts uh analyzing all of these you know stocks current events crypto markets all of these things that are happening um how did you get into that like what what are things that a normal person should be thinking about or looking at should they not be trading if you don't you know if you're not really going to spend time around it should you just invest for the long run like what what what are some of your thoughts around trading the latter so listen trading's fun but the first thing everyone should know is you're going to lose and it should be your play money that that the the bottom of every bank email that says you know uh pass results not indicative of future uh gains and and be careful and only invest money you can invest in boys 100 true right so i i naturally got into it when i was at penn in the late 90s at penn like wall street finance jobs was like gathering halloween camp right i mean literally no no joke my big big brother and my fraternity went to work for solomon smith barney became the pen recruiter recruited my big brother in my fraternity who then said do you want a job at solomon smith barney to me and i said i don't know what that is and i also don't have a resume is that problematic i'm dj and he's like no you're hired if you want the job i didn't take it but it was that easy right so to go the old boy's closetman banking job uh and so obviously i had a superficial knowledge of markets and sort of a basic understanding at that point um but i learned by the school of hard knocks which i don't think most people generally survive i was just kind of there long enough to succeed i mean the first time i really got any money in my life and i'm not talking about a lot of money i'm talking about like paying off my debt so i actually have some money i started investing was like 2006 and 2007 so you can imagine how well that went uh considering the timing right so i lost all of that uh in 2012 i went all in on a stock called eric's it was a pharmaceutical company i you know i had heard from friends who were consulting there that they had this groundbreaking drug that was going to be released i'm not kidding like i put basically everything i had into it was trading at six dollars um a month later on the earnings quarterly earnings call the ceo showed up like i don't know on mushrooms or something it was like yeah guys we were like money is going to be a problem man it was really i think it was high and the stock went to zero full dose i literally rode a actual company that was listed on the stock market zero and a d listing i saw a hilarious thing by the way on riding to xero the other day which you might have seen of um all of these people that have shorted a stock and if it's short of stock you're like borrowing shares to sell and you actually need to be able to close that short out and if it goes to zero and is de-listed you cannot yeah you're getting it out of yourself and so you're paying the carrying load of interest on something that like you could not have been more right about but it literally you can't get out of it so there are these hedge funds there's like perfect trade there's like there's a list of of hedge funds that are like completely [ __ ] because they're sitting in a short that was perfect you wanted to go to like a dollar liquidity in liquidity yeah so i quit for a very long time and then i sort of got back into trading uh you know a little bit of options forex and stuff and learned technical analysis sort of on my own i had a mentor this guy christopher inks who uh texas west capital who i met on twitter uh years ago and uh sort of developed it from there and uh but to your point the most important thing everyone can know is just don't trade just don't trade it's so easy to make money in crypto by simply investing and waiting that's not even just true in crypto i always like to tell people all of these people who've made generational wealth in the stock market the baby boomers that have millions of millions of dollars have never even heard of technical analysis not only have they never thought about trading or looked at a chart they don't even know that they exist right all they've literally ever done is taken money that they don't need and put it into something and let inflation do the rest of the job funny personal story on this exact thing so earlier this year when i was leaving my job and i was going to go start this new thing um i thought i was going to go join like another fund and i was interviewing at this i won't name i won't name it but there's a large crossover investment funds they do venture and they do hedge fund stuff and i had to do a case study and i had to talk them through why i thought this stock was a buy or a short and i pitched it as a buy and then they asked me at what price and i said and they were like why not right here because i said slightly under it and i had like seen i didn't know [ __ ] about trading stocks like i knew nothing because i just bought and held stuff and i had seen some of scott's stuff on like oh moving averages and this and that and so i said like wow the 50 to you know just dropped below the 50-day moving average so it looks like it's got some downside and the like founding partner of this firm on this thing looks at me and he's like what like i've literally in my entire career i'm like i've made a billion dollars and i've never thought about a 50-day moving average and i wanted to like unzip my body and just like run away needless to say did not get the job by the way i got rejected right but it was unbelievable and that illustrates my point perfectly right so even at the like peak degeneracy of my hardcore trading which i'm decent at i would never trade with more than 20 of my portfolio 15 i learned very early that you're probably not going to beat the market and the core of your portfolio should be invested right so where is the curious like where you're 75 you're you know where is that money so listen and the funny thing is before covid i was one of the hardcore crypto guys who was saying yeah but still don't have more than like 15 of your money in crypto it's still a risky investment but then i stopped rebalancing you know i saw the nonsense that was happening with money printing obviously and stocks only going up while people on mainstream were suffering all the memes that are very real and very true and it just became readily apparent that i didn't really want that much to do with that system anymore that doesn't mean i sold all my stocks i still invest in my retirement accounts i still passively buy all the things that i've always passively bought but for me now crypto is you know 70 80 of my portfolio and then breaking that down 70 percent of that i've always believed 70 investments 15 cash 15 for trading and investing in your best friend's company that is going to lose your money right um that's that's been there the 15 yeah i guess uh fund um and that's basically bitcoin was the core of it always ethereum caught up so it's a 60 40 bitcoin ethereum split now for me and then the rest okay we'll call that uh you know 58 38 and the rest is the dust from the best trades of my life do a trade goes up 100 x something like that which happens in crypto i never sold the last five or ten percent of that position and moved it into the long term in case that is the amazon of the future in 20 years and i don't feel like i missed the boat i'm a huge fan of scaling in and scaling out of positions and always keeping a little something just in case so there's you know this sort of dust of all these other things but still as deep down this rabbit hole as i am i still believe that bitcoin is the most important asset and that it's a slow sort of drip from there obviously to ethereum and then way down the risk curve to where some of them start to just naturally look like trades and not necessarily like like investments but i still think your average person should have a stock portfolio right like listen we can rail against the problems with inflation and the problems with fed policy but that benefits people who take advantage of that inflation by buying assets and buying hard assets and that should be you on if you can you know but uh it's a it's a bit of a hard pill to stomach the further you go down sort of this rabbit hole and the more orange peeled or red pilled whichever one you want to say and you really watch it i mean it's like watching it's like watching a horrible comedy you know like one of those comedies that's also gut-wrenching kind of like cable guy you know that movie cable guy with j you're like he's so funny but it's like it hurts you know yeah um like the scene in swingers where he calls the girl like 12 times in a row like that you know like i look back i'm like that's hilarious but also stop calling you know um and so it's just really hard to like i don't actively want to go out and invest and buy stock right now i just don't have you done um anything new like i'm thinking about like new markets so you were clearly you know you went heavy into crypto like you embraced this new market new asset class one of the new asset classes i've been starting to get excited about which greg i like i keep talking azir off about is um event contracts and like uh prediction markets and so predict it was sort of the like first player that was in this space the challenge with them was it wasn't regulated until the limits were like 500 or something like that so it was fun like you could bet on donald trump or uh buy it or whoever yeah yeah and you could do those things but like yeah yeah exactly and it wasn't but it was small and then recently i came across this platform which uh it called calci that i um had a lot of fun with was like it was the first um cftc regulated they like spent two years getting cftc regulated so there's no limits and there's market makers there's liquidity there's these huge markets and i had so much fun with it that i like pounded on their door until they let me invest in the platform which i'm super psyched about and it's awesome but the thing that has struck me about that is like it's a new market and there's still so much pricing and efficiency in it because it's so new that it's like it's almost a feature of the market because i get in there and i look at it and there's things happening like you know they're yes no contracts and so there was one like the whole stupid janet yell in the unrealized capital gains tax and there was a market that was like will that get passed by december 31st 2021 it had to be that was like one to a hundred yeah no but he was trading at 87 cents on the no and i was like okay so in a month i'm gonna make 13 like that's the easiest i will pour any amount of money into that because the government can't get [ __ ] done first off on that time on anything let alone that maybe take and but it was like i mean it was it was those kind of things when you see a new market it's kind of a cool opportunity so like are you do you experiment with any new markets have you looked at prediction markets like are there any things that you're seeing out there that are interesting to you i i haven't really looked at prediction markets uh i want to intro you to these guys but i would i would absolutely love that but i have in the last uh year really started doing a lot of like smaller angel stuff it's always my belief though i think you're much more in the weeds like i i know what i know and i will invest in anything where i trust the person knows what they know right and that's always been my path so you know from going to school where i did i have a lot of very successful friends they have different hedge funds funds so like a friend of mine runs a fund called merida capital and it's marijuana investments i know nothing about marijuana investments but i know that i want to invest in it so i invest in his fund and call it a day yeah right rather than trying to figure it out myself i'd rather go to the guy who knows exactly what he's doing that's a great mental model by the way just to pause on that like just it do what you're great at and be exceptional at the thing you're great at and outsource everything [ __ ] else even within crypto now two other people that are great at those things right even within crypto now i'm taking a very similar approach but when i came into crypto it was like bitcoin ethereum and a basket of all coins right now it's the metaverse and d5 and nfts and right so like i i'm not i don't have enough time or under even comprehension to get into punks and apes and other jpegs in cartoons i'm not saying they don't have value i'm saying i don't understand it and i'm not going to throw my money at something i don't understand but i'll invest in someone's nft fund right like uh there's arca who's a big hedge fund in the space i just invested in their d5 fund but i'm looking at their nft fund now because i don't know enough about it i know about the platforms that are building it i have a superficial understanding of the market but now crypto is so exciting and there's so much happening i don't feel like i can even keep up with that right so i need people to to fi to guide me in the directions even within crypto like play to earn and i mean metaverse yeah the metaverse is going to be economies of scale beyond anything we've even seen in the real world for the investment opportunities one day you can't tell me you're going to be able to figure out what the best investments are in that space it's a powerful i mean this is a really really powerful thing for people to understand and like everyone that's listening to this is you don't need to be a genius at everything you're not going to be and so focus on playing the games that you are uniquely well suited to win the things that you can really double down on and become an expert in really focus on those go deep become that expert and double down and the things you're not embrace the fact that you don't know that outsource it to people who are to your point like invest in the fund where that person is spending all of their time on nfts or defy whatever it is but don't feel like you need to go be an expert in everything we've talked about it with solana i'm like the idiot that somehow has completely missed solana but my whole thing greg has keep he keeps giving me [ __ ] about it like oh you haven't invested in it and my my whole thing with it is and i'm probably an idiot uh i'm sure it's gonna be amazing but i have not spent the time nor do i have the time to go do my research and diligence to understand it and so will i go and invest in a friend who really has done and and i have done that i'm an lp in funds that are doing that and so i probably have some derivative bets on it but i don't have the bandwidth or the time to understand it so i want to play games where it's my playing field and the table is set how i like it like if you're a tennis player if you're serena williams you don't want to go and play the match that maria sharapova wants to play you want to play your match so so what's the advice you know not everyone went to an ivy league school and has friends who right or is accredited or exactly access which is a whole other conversation unfortunately yeah unfortunately so what's the advice for people who want to do basically employ the strategy of find the smartest person you know and give them and place a bet you know how do people think about that that only comes with access and that's the reason it's only something i've been able to do in the last few years unfortunately the fact is the united states law that is supposed to protect consumers actually prohibits consumers or prohibits your average citizen who does not have enough money from the same opportunities that wealthy people have it's a sad but real truth and that's why i love d5 and i love crypto because everybody has a level playing field in that space as long as i don't regulate it away and do the same thing to it which is another conversation and another possibility but what i would say in a lesson that i learned listen there's famous quotes about it right don't put all your eggs in one basket but then there's a flip side of that uh buff it someone you know put all your eggs in one basket and watch that basket right and so i i've had mark yusuko from morgan creek on my i was one of the favorite people in the world this guy's more like sound bites than any human being you could make one of those like little sound boards on the internet i don't know you're coming you're a close second yeah yeah well that's mario man from all my podcast guests um but mark said to me he's like you know that's a total misnomer to say to diversify diversification is what you do when you're already rich you don't get rich through diversification you get rich through concentration with the caveat being that you choose right right so i would say if you're young and you can afford to lose because when you're you don't feel like when you're 25 that you can afford to go broke but you can completely afford to go broke you can reinvent yourself find something else especially in this world with the gig economy and you know find something that you're very passionate about or very good at and concentrate all of your energy on that and once that succeeds then you can start placing those bets in those other arenas the fact is if you're a 25 year old with a 50 000 a year job who's just getting by and paying rent you can't have investments in six different arenas and spaces you just can't uh so your butt you can buy an index fund and protect the stock market which is what i did you know just buy spy man just buy sby call it a day number go up correct correct me if i'm wrong it feels feels like you've had high conviction throughout your life really like you've placed like you haven't placed all your eggs in one basket you've kind of you talked about it right you talked about how this you know there was that pharmaceutical stock and you kind of like went all in or you know you got excited about kryptos you went all in is it safe to say that like you've had you've had this strategy for 20 years i would say i've had this strategy for 20 years and it failed for 18. exactly 27 years probably i started i was starting you know i tell the story as i left penn and i became a dj and that erases 20 years of utter and epic entrepreneurial failures that i tried in between on the side of dj i actually started a company with four friends from college called phillytonite.com which is in 1998 1999 that was a nightlife website for philadelphia restaurants if you remember city search which yeah i remember it was basically a localized city search in philadelphia and then we ended up not getting along and i quit the year after college was djing on the side i have 10 examples like that i actually was the editor-in-chief of a magazine that i started in philadelphia which then got consumed by another publication in new york which is why i eventually moved to new york i became their editor-in-chief lasted one year because probably not the easiest person to work with and i'm not very good at the whole having a boss thing but uh yeah i mean i've you know i sort of like advanced the ball very slowly but by like falling down and hitting it with my face as opposed to some dramatic beautiful uh move you know um and luckily i think that i just always had at least a small safety net or something i was doing that could sustain it and keep me afloat as i sort of uh found what i was good at i had a great dj career but i was never the big name on the top of the flyer right i was always the guy behind the guy or the smaller name on the flyer or the opening act for this guy or the dj in this guy's band and it was amazing and i made money and i and it was super fun and i played in stadiums you know but rarely was that specifically about me right so i would say i was like i made it to like level d you know of the of the a-list um and this is the first thing that i found where i sort of with that same mentality have found this level of success but it is definitely fair to say i mean i've never been deterred by anyone else's opinion of what i should be doing certainly or uh really have ever wasted my time on something i didn't find interesting i i you know like i said i don't pay attention to i don't have hyper focus unless i'm super passionate about it i will just i'll wash out i could never have one of i could never just have a basic desk job where i do a menial task and i i actually think it's amazing that people can do that i would just get fired like they would walk in and i'd be playing a video game you know i just wouldn't and i would have gotten my work done in 20 minutes and be bored for seven and a half hours trying to pretend that i was doing work you know it's just sort of the nature that's how i got through school as well um you know so yes i think that uh i've always been hyper focused i just got lucky enough that i finally found something where that worked and you you continued like you didn't give up right imagine being married to me though or being my parents who sent me to that ivy league school right it's it's probably a struggle but uh it's good to win in the end i guess to some degree but it was not always easy yeah i mean the whole thing that i'm coming away with is like just this idea of like just stop playing other people's games and play yours i've written about this before and i think about it so much because it's i mean it tracks my own personal stories like i for a long time felt like i was playing someone else's game and i went down the career path that like i thought i was supposed to or that people were excited about for me and i felt like it was prestigious and people thought highly of me because of it but it wasn't my game it wasn't my zone of genius and we all i think we all need to find ours and it's a process like it took you 27 years it took me at least seven um probably longer and i just think for everybody listening one of the things like i'm really learning from you is like through this story and your whole trajectory it's just find the things that you are great at find the things that you're passionate about and just go all in on those and stop worrying about the [ __ ] you're bad at honestly like people focus so much on like my weaknesses i'm gonna try to work at my weaknesses you're much better off and it's like maybe it's contrarian advice and it's a hot take but like you're much better off just saying [ __ ] it to the stuff you're bad at and like i'm probably not gonna ever be amazing at those things i'm bad at let me just like not focus on it and i'm gonna double down and go all in on the [ __ ] i'm great at yeah and go contribute and like get in the discord the community aspect of this if you wanna go participate in things go join a community be a part of it go create jiho is an amazing example of that like he was just a he was like mopping the floors in the community uh in the early action days and now he's a co-founder of it he's the head of the girl the ceo of twitter was just a lowly engineer crazy i mean the ceo of walmart is like a perfect example in a blue collar way of like he as a stocking manager in a walmart store and now he's the ceo of one of the biggest companies in the world biggest retailer in the world it's amazing and i think all of that comes from just being willing to double down on the things you're great at and just saying screw it to the stuff you're not as good at and yell yell like you create content right like do it just like just put it out there if your content's good enough eventually and like i said initially it's going to be bad but eventually it'll evolve into something that people engage with and listen if you're bad at it no one engages with it you'll move on with your life but at least you got to try and i think a huge part of what you're saying which i agree 100 with is another thing you always say would you shoot your shot right it's it's also letting go of the fear of judgment or rejection that comes along with it because i feel like that's what holds a lot of people back from really fully pursuing that dream i mean you always tell me the story or we joke about how you just cold called basically mark cuban by typing in a bunch of email addresses and hoping that one of them was going to match you know and that worked the guy started retweeting your content and engaging with you and you know most people are not willing to do that most people are not willing to suffer the judgment of their family and friends when they say i'm going to quit my job and become a twitter you know influencer not what i said but there are people obviously i'm going to become an instagram influencer right that's what i want to do or i'm going to become a trader i'm going to go all in on trading and take all the money that i have and i'm going to make money doing this an artist micah johnson we keep talking about i'm going to quit baseball and become a painter i've never painted i've only painted for two years but i'm going to become a painter now is one of the most prolific nft artists in the world because he has the talent to support it but i think there's so much fear of judgment and failure and just being shot down that people never quite fully pursue it so not only do you got to go all in you got to then also disregard all the external factors and find a community that embraces you for doing that because like i i had you and it's a good example of it like you were so supportive of the things i was doing and saying like this is [ __ ] awesome you should be doing this full time like why and you were saying that to me and then i met greg through a group chat that we were in and like all of these people when i was going i was about to go take another you know job in the finance world and they were all like why are you doing that like that doesn't make any sense yeah and that was what i thought i was supposed to do because of what everything i'd done before but i had people and i had a community that actually believed in me before i believed in myself on these things and gave me the like permission almost that i felt like i needed to do that and so you need to and they're out there and now with the internet you can find those people but it's it's incredible it's amazing and so it's it's like give yourself give yourself the permission to go put your neck out on the line shoot your shot every amazing thing that's happened in my life has like somehow came from being shameless in some sense of like just going and putting myself out on the line and then find the community of people that will just embrace you for who you are and be genuine about it um and so many good things can happen if you do that i just like it because you asked about trading you know you guys asked about trading before that's what separates someone who succeeds in trading and someone who fails is being able to accept a loss not having fear of losing it's the only reason i was even decent at trading and i used to be terrible at terrible at it because i was so emotional about losing right it's the same thing that makes a good poker player makes a good athlete makes a good trader you have to just eliminate that fear and be able to accept a loss and move on with your life right you can't dwell on it forever if you're a traitor and you dwell on every single loss you take or you say um you know my plan was to only lose a thousand bucks but i think it's going to go right back up so i'm going to move my stop loss down zero right you lose in there been there right we've all been there and that and that's what and that's what separates is that ability to sort of have a confidence in your plan and to let that plan play out without fear and that at the end of the day being able to separate your emotions and act that out like a robot is what will make you good at trading which is but also will make you good at any of these things that you try to attack and tackle in life i mean if that's not a good place to end i don't really know this was like i honestly it's so funny because i didn't know where this conversation would necessarily go but it was for me at least personally it was like one of the more formative conversations i've had so that's a formative guide to him and formative conversation wow you're very cool for me this is this is awesome and thank you so much thank you guys we're we're we're going to reconnect we got to really reconnect we're already best friends i know exactly too positive now he's going to be a dick to you so that you remember him come on man i don't remember that i can't that's true he is too nice um where can people follow you everything is linked to my twitter okay go to his twitter s-o-t-t-a-l-k yeah and seriously like the most prolific content creator out there within the crypto world insane i've learned personally so much from you so and even if you're not interested in trading and you want to understand i don't want people to trade exactly and tune into a live stream or if you're not interested in crypto if you're not interested in making money just the fact that like you have a model for creating content i'm sure a lot of people listening want to understand how that happens it's a great way to get started and just follow you you're also just a fun guy man you post funny [ __ ] i try i appreciate it i mean we're all having fun at the end of the day we're all here for the memes yeah it's true life isn't mean i'm just trying to like do enough serious content that i can slide into exactly you've got 11 every time you've got a limit awesome thank you so much thank you guys appreciate it thank you pretty wide wide-ranging conversation there um i had a few but what was your one big takeaway scott is not afraid to put in the work and share his curiosities that's for sure yeah he's i mean he's had like a pretty wide-ranging career man i mean he clearly had some like challenging times with some of the failures he talked about and what i took away was just this idea and this framework of just focusing on the things you're good at like finding your zone of genius and outsourcing the rest just being willing to go find the people that are great at the things you're not good at and just outsource to them and just double down on those things that you love that you're passionate about that you can get up every morning and do and go all in on those things and the outcomes let them be as they may and find your find your niche right like he he found like a subset of crypto twitter and became an influencer in like a niche that didn't really exist at the time and and [Music] you know built relationships and and and built something that people love so good on him for that yeah super interesting hope you guys enjoy it we're going to jump into the community with him and go deeper on it uh thank you all for tuning in 2022 is a great time to take control of your sleep i used to sleep

up your investing game today check out commonstock.com you won't regret it so um you saw this vampire attack the yeah um i think that's a hilarious name by the way which we can get into as part of all this but um open c got vampire attacked um by this thing called what's it called looks look stock looks rare looksrare.org um kind of crazy whole thing so you you're gonna have to correct me if my like research in general is off on this i dug into it earlier because um i'm trying to be more of a d-gen around this stuff but um it's kind of cool so basically you know open c is like the biggest player in the nft marketplace space they just raised money mario at the generalist did a great piece on it but they raised money at like what a 15 billion dollar valuation or some like massive valuation i could probably pull it up while we're talking here um but they raise money they're like you know the air incumbent yeah 13.3 billion in in new round of venture funding massive company this company called looks rare which is looksrare.org comes along and does something kind of neat it's called a vampire attack but basically they entice you to come over and list nfts on their new marketplace looksrare.org and the way they're doing it is by offering you an airdrop of these looks tokens um and all of a sudden people were doing it and the reason was because these looks tokens were actually valuable and it was based on the amount of transaction volume i think you did on openc the number of tokens you get dropped i think and so you could go yeah and how much you bought so okay yeah it was your eth volume on openc yeah i belie i believe it's you know if you spent let's say 10 eth on openc you got some sort of percentage you know something like that in lux token okay okay so i my experience with this like i think it's fascinating it's actually like from a consumer standpoint a pretty neat growth hack because basically what they did was incentivize people with this thing that who knows if it has value but basically you just had to list you had to list an nft for sale on looksrare.org in order to claim these tokens and what started happening was as people started claiming them people started staking them buying them um suddenly they had real value and so like i went over i was kind of late i think it all started on monday or something like that i think you texted me about it a few others i didn't pay attention and then i went over to it yesterday and pulled up my thing and my looks rare token drop was worth like 4 8 or something like that um in in the amount of looks tokens they were going to send me which is bananas like they were just giving you free money right so what did you do so you you claim the looks token and then tell people what you did yeah so all you had to do to claim it was list one for sale so i had some like unbelievably worthless nft in my open c you know in my wallet that i listed for sale um which was never going to sell i listed it for 1 eth on the looks rare thing and that allowed me to claim it so again like i kind of found a loophole to the system because it didn't matter and it was like i think it was chodes by the way it was the toads derivative chodes that has no volume no liquidity um i listed that it allowed me to claim i think i claimed 3 000 looks um and maybe i'm like embarrassing maybe that's not many i don't know how many other people got um but it was worth like at the time when i did it i think it was worth 15 us dollars like so in eth um you know it was like five eight or maybe a little less than that five eighth um but kind of crazy and so then basically it says like they have you there and you can sell it and i think a lot of people probably did and dumped it but then a few of my friends were like hey you can actually stake it and so then on the website they have this whole thing where you can immediately stake the looks that you got and generate like they have a live tracker of the apr you can generate that's like very gamified and so i was like wow this is free money that no one like i didn't think i was gonna have so i might as well stake it and so i staked it and it's like a 950 apr to stake it or something like right now right so i think i mean there's a lot of interesting pieces of it first of all you got fifteen thousand dollars for doing nothing someone basically just wrote you a check for fifteen thousand dollars um assuming it's liquid yeah assuming you can sell it right like sometimes they do these air drops and the thing isn't liquid you can't actually sell it so who knows but looks like i claimed mine i claimed mine and i sold it right away a lot of people do that right so you so you converted it into eth converted it into eth which i converted into usd which i transferred to my account and i went and bought something so like liquid and that and you know it happened and it happened quickly so i think like for me it was like christmas came really early yeah we're in mid-january um so so yeah the first thing is like the the fact that people are getting this like random check is is honestly why i think a lot of people don't like people in crypto or people who are doing these nft things is like sometimes it is really easy money um and we can talk about like the perception of nfts and the perception of crypto people after but that's the first thing i wanted to make mention of how like how crazy that is the second thing is air drops in general are just fascinating right because basically what you're doing is you're looking at public blockchain data and you're rewarding loyalty so because sahel bloom is a loyal openc customer someone else another company or another product or another community is able to take that data and potentially grab the users from openc because that's what they're trying to do right they're trying to bootstrap the the network and yeah sorry go ahead you're hitting on something really interesting that relates to our conversation with scott too which is um one of the it's actually an interesting innovation of web three i think like chris dixon had a threat on this recently that web 3 is interesting in the context that you can actually vote with your feet very credibly because this platform looks rare tiny no one knows what it is they can come in and do something like this and then maybe they start charging you know a quarter of what openc charges from a commission standpoint and suddenly you know like people have to race to the bottom on that margin that they can charge and clip because i might just vote with my fee now i can like go over to looks and maybe i'm an early looks adopter and start using the platform more i buy looks tokens now i'm incentivized to use looks because i actually want looks to succeed i've got a bunch of looks now i'm staking it if a bunch of people start using looks like i might start hyping looks up because i'm a part of it and they're charging a lower fee and so it's kind of interesting because it does remove power from these centralized platforms when people can really vote with their feet this quickly yeah i also think it makes the open seas of the world or the competition just a lot more like make them more scared which makes the product better you know they they have to adapt you know i'm sure they're looking at um this product and they're like okay what we know we don't want to lose people right so what do we got to do on our platform do we need to make it more decentralized do we need to add you know certain they added they had a few features on on looks uh on that platform that you know opencv was missing so um it's pretty interesting the other thing also is there are kinks with with airdrops right so you mentioned that you know you went on the platform you basically listed something a chodes which is worth zero for you know one eth so you're kind of like that's a problem right because then you don't that platform is gonna have a lot of like bad inventory and bad merchandise um so i think um there are kinks and we're i'm sure that they're gonna fix it and a lot you know but we the cool thing is we're learning about this process people are trying things people are pushing the boundaries um i don't understand how it's not like it's just so weird to me because they've created value from nothing um like there's there's this thing of just like money from nothing that still confuses me fundamentally when i try to think in first principles on this kind of stuff because they sent me a bunch of tokens that they just created out of thin air that don't actually have value but now they do because they've dropped it to a bunch of people and because a bunch of people now have it and are trading it and because a bunch of people like me have staked it um you can actually trade it and there's liquidity because that's what the staking does is it's providing liquidity in the in the protocol um i just like it it breaks my mind a little bit to understand it um and so for me personally whenever that happens i try to like dig in more and that's why i'm staking it honestly is i just want to like participate and learn more about it and kind of be along for the ride and see what happens but it's pretty fascinating i think it's interesting and it's like it's a um it is a case study in web 3 and how these things can materialize and like a company that no one had ever heard of i don't think for the most part a week ago is like part of the zeitgeist all of a sudden i'm sure people had um ed opens here thinking about it yeah yeah absolutely i think um i'm sure actually i'm sure they're more than thinking about i think they're they're probably looking at in their their they must be scared or feel a bit vulnerable um and i don't blame them to be honest like you know i i don't know the exact numbers but probably tens of thousands if not a hundred thousand plus people have gone and claimed tokens that's like you know i think one of the takeaways i have from this whole thing is networks have value you know it's a reminder that networks have value like yes these tokens are coming out of thin air but when you're creating a network that network of buyers and sellers has a lot of value and scarcity drives value too right you're staking your tokens those tokens are going out of your wallet therefore demand you know supply goes down puts price pressure to go up so a lot of interesting things i wish i paid more attention uh in economics class um in school um i have to relearn it all and i've been relearning it all in the trenches but uh yeah yeah i mean it's gonna be interesting to track the price is remarkably stable for i like i would have thought everyone just dumped it and it became worthless and the prices basically hovered around four bucks for the last several days and with a few pops and a few drops but like generally pretty pretty stable i just like it's interesting to think about centralization and decentralization because when you think about the biggest companies within within the crypto and web 3 landscape you know the ones that have like really made it institutionally they're still centralized like coinbase open c they're centralized and so this is kind of scary like because you can have these attacks that are somewhat successful i mean i would qualify this as successful at this point um that come from like truly decentralized positions and chip away at the veneer of these of these centralized players so it's kind of interesting it's definitely going to be one to track and um you know in this era where like memes and um you know the internet virality you know kind of own the zeitgeist um it's a it's a very telling reminder of um you know not being complacent like earlier in the week i wrote about um the icarus paradox and like not not flying too close to the sun and getting complacent and hubris and i think like web theory is a perfect example of where you have to really be careful about that to the point you made earlier totally yeah we're we've moved from means of production to memes of production it's a good segue too to who we have in today i feel like you teed that up pretty well um memes of production i like that i like that and you know we're we're gonna bring our guest in to jam um and that's a perfect transition because what meme has owned the internet and the zeitgeist over the last really two years more than dogecoin um the joke cryptocurrency that took over the world um so we've got billy marcus who will not be on video because um he avoids showing his face publicly due to security concerns which i don't blame him for because there is a dark side of the internet um but super super excited to have him in with us and uh get to talk i i mean i need to get the story of doge because there's some just absurdity along the way in that but then you know talk about in the new era of investing meme investing you know the funniest outcome wins and uh dive into all of this memes of production i loved your comment there totally i'm excited to talk to him i've never like i follow him on twitter uh which is an awesome follow i don't you know i haven't done like to be honest much research on him um i'm just looking forward to chatting with him and hearing hearing like what is his um like why did he start it you know how how does he how does he see you know me you know memes of production what does he think of this of airdrops i'm curious of that too um and just yes see if it's gonna be fun guy or not it's gonna be fun shiba toshi nakamoto on twitter i think his at is something different but that's what his name is so he's got to be pretty funny because i do think that's a that's a funny name um let's bring him in and uh let's dive in on this now he's coming in hey there billy hey can you hear me yeah we can hear you man what's going on i hear a lot of weird noise uh oh i don't like that's our voices that's our voices no no it's like a like yelling like hey i don't know uh let me put this next to the mic i'm worried is it in your brain uh hang on it might be from my end oh my god it is from i was looking at some twitter video that was on loot it was a bunch of like people screaming like hey john i'm like what and it like happened to coincide exactly with like coming in here and i was like what the heck i was like holy [ __ ] man billy's having a paranoid attack isn't a good start or it's going to be a great start and this will be an awesome episode i don't know anyway are you good now are we starting we're not starting the episode right this is uh oh no we're starting man cold open no no we can cut it we can cut whatever you want out man we do whatever post-production you want so if you say anything that you didn't like um i did think that was pretty funny though in general greg and i record we record straight through so greg and i were like recording before we like do a kind of opening jam and then bring someone in but um thank you so much for joining us man yeah no problem i hope you have a drink well actually it's pretty early your time you're on the west coast right yeah it's two and i still have a lot of work to do today so oh man i'm not drinking it i do have water so that's okay well greg's drinking a sparkling water i'm sitting here like the degenerate on the call drinking a whiskey um but it's cold in the northeast man so i need it i need it right now yeah what's your what's your drink choice in general i'm a bourbon guy i like bourbon i mean i love tequila um but tequila like on an evening in the cold northeast on a thursday night didn't feel right so i'm drinking bourbon right now kentucky owl bourbon whiskey nice yeah i like that billy i like whiskey and coke uh it's like if i just go to a bar and i have no creativity i either say like give me something that doesn't taste like alcohol or just whiskey and coke simple man i like it i like it well dude thank you um thank you so much again for joining us um this is gonna be fun i mean you and i have like i want to give a little bit of the background because it's funny but basically like billy and my relationship is a uh classic of 2021 2022 which is literally we met on twitter like i meet everyone greg you and i met on twitter like all of my favorite you know boyfriends and girlfriends are on twitter um and i just like i was drawn to um how kind of just like fun open um and you know just like openly sharing you were you just had this like vivacious personality on twitter and i love that and your name is shibitoshi nakamoto which i find [ __ ] hilarious um and so i started just like interacting with you we were dm'ing and then we talked about bringing you on and you know you mentioned that you don't do like public appearances for security reasons which i totally get um but just so stoked to have you here and get to jam more on you know meme investing the story of doge your background and and just get into it yeah it sounds fun i know you as the guy on twitter who posts really long threads that are smart like he's better than the guy on twitter who posts really long threads that are dumb so i think some people probably think that of me too which is fine and i'll just mute them um but i appreciate you man you're right you're the man and i think we were racing to a million at one point and you were like actually billy uh challenged me to a race to a million followers on twitter he was at 940 000 and i was at 400 000 and challenge me to race and honestly the audacity to do that just made me respect him more um so anyway welcome to the show and thank you for joining us yeah i like challenges that i can i can win easily yeah it's smart man just better things you know you can win so can you can we just start and this is not an interview um very informal and feel free to curse and have a blast but like can you just tell people like what your background is who you are like how you kind of came to you know kind of came to be the founder of what you ended up building uh sure i'm i'm just a software guy uh who've played video games all my life i'm just grew up a nerd and kind of an internet troll um on aol i would like you know impersonate guides and be a douche and then uh moved on to different message boards and was a douche there uh and then grew up a little bit but still have that you know introduced in me um so when i came to like learned about cryptocurrency i like you know saw uh the bitcoin talk forms i think uh is what was called uh in like 2013. and was this like on reddit or where was it no it is actually a form called bitcoin talk that was like where in 2013 that was where the like hub of all of bitcoin talk was and i was like well this is fascinating people are like using their idle cpu cycles to make money i want to make money uh so i you know try to learn how to mine and then uh eventually learned that it took way more power to mine than you could get because bitcoin at that time was like a hundred bucks uh a bitcoin it does have very embarrassing trades on coinbase that are like me purchasing like 10 bitcoin and then like three days later me selling the 10 bitcoin for like 20 profit me like yeah totally earned that you know did you uh like on on the forum did you make a lot of friends or were you kind of just no solo doing your own thing building by yourself that that is not a foreign bitcoin talk was not a form to make friends and meet people it was just a you know forum to talk about how great you are or how great whatever dumb altcoin that you're making is gonna be and then people trying to mine it um and then other people just you know speculating on whatever they think the price is gonna be in the future and stuff like that so sound on twitter now i guess this makes me think of um like early days silk road by the way um i don't know if you guys have ever read that book um i think it's called american kingpin it's actually one of my favorite um pieces of non-fiction i've read in the last five ten years so if anyone hasn't read it it's worth a read but it's basically the story of um silk road which was like for anyone that doesn't know it it was like the amazon of um you know kind of illicit activity at the time and most of the transactions were through bitcoin so people were buying drugs and unfortunately you know weapons and different things on there but it was like the ultimate libertarian um you know government can't control what you do this is an open marketplace and you could buy with bitcoin and it was like part of the early ethos of the bitcoin internet um was running through um through silk road and honestly like i think a lot of the bad rep that people have um applied to crypto still goes back to what you know their kind of predisposition was around it with silk road but this guy the founder of it who was like you know jeff bezos found it all founded amazon this guy ross albrecht founded silk road is in jail for life um you know based on a handful of different things and you know different people will tell you different things about what he did but super worth reading the book but this guy's in jail for life for founding this thing that you know was ostensibly a marketplace where people happen to do illegal things um but a fascinating story of like early days of bitcoin and and some of the stuff that was happening in the utility of it early on yeah absolutely the primary utility in 2013 of of cryptocurrency was illegal gambling or illegal purchase of drugs and weapons and whatever other terrible things and yeah and you know just speculation in general so that was like the scene in 2013 and then there's all these altcoins uh that were usually like based on litecoin uh the script based uh which were a little easier to mine with a graphics card like they hadn't been solved like at that time uh asic miners the specialized computers uh that are used to mine bitcoin or mine uh uh litecoin right now um we're only good for bitcoin and so there are a whole bunch of coins that if you had a fancy graphics card like i did that you could mine it with your uh graphics card and get a decent amount of them so that's how i started learning about these so it wasn't like was it really like gamers then just people that had these fancy graphic cards not really like uh so that ties into like uh when i found all of these coins and like all of the like different coins that people had uh made it was like oh these are all dumb like i could probably learn how to make one of these they seem like they're all the same and i found a guide uh for how to do it and it was like you know take litecoin change seven parameters and recompile it and then you have your own stupid crypto coin so it's like okay cool so i i had just been playing animal crossing a lot um and in 2013 no one knew what animal crossing was and i released bells coin this is my first cryptocurrency uh my only other one other than dogecoin and no one knew what it was like literally no one in bitcoin talk forms had any idea what animal crossing was they're like what is this looks like a cartoon i'm like it's from a game you know bells like another crossing like no with this stupid like it won't make me rich i'm like okay so it just died like almost right away so when that what year was that sorry that was 2013 that you did that yeah that was like mid-2013 okay and then yeah after that i was like well crypto or like obviously i i can just retire from this i don't want to get yelled at by random people um but then uh bitcoin does that exist does bills coin still exist anywhere i'm like googling frantically because i've never heard of it but i like i need to find this now it does exist in the form of dogecoin because uh bitcoin or uh dogecoin is forked directly from bell's queen oh okay so you gotta walk us through it man okay go from here okay so no one knew about bell's coin you started this thing it was a joke yeah yeah how did this fork into into doge so like i don't know two or three months later uh i like bitcoin just crashed and i went to some like irc channel that was like oh why did bitcoin crash oh it's because china's stuff which you know is the same story now and uh someone linked to dogecoin.com and was like ah this is gonna be the next big thing and i clicked on it and uh jackson palmer on the other side of the earth in australia had like just put up this site um with a like dogecoin uh picture and like uh all these like pop-ups comic sans like wow and blah blah you can see in an archive.org um from 2013 still and uh it just said on the bottom if you want to make this a reality like hit me up and i was like i want to make this a reality because i know how to make cryptocurrency uh so yeah i just took the next couple hours and uh like all i wanted to do was uh change the regular bitcoin client uh to be comic sans font and then like have some custom stuff on it like instead of mining it was like dig and other stupid things like that and like change some of the the font or the the icons um and then yeah that was it it was just like this silly ridiculous thing it's like haha we're gonna make dogecoin it's gonna totally take over the world lol and then we released it and then and then stuff happened what was it that you had sorry yeah when you um when you say like you know you thought it was gonna take over the world do you mean like you thought it was gonna take over like the current you know small crypto world or did you actually think like like did you have a vision of like you know and you know today like post malone's buying like board apes and visas adding you know crypto and it's just like it's it's cr it's mainstream i'm just curious like did you and jackson like ha you know have some foresight to oh no we had no foresight whatsoever and not only that it was just complete joke it was just like this this thing's gonna die in like a couple days it's obviously stupid no one's gonna buy this like this is just a gag because it was funny but like it was functional it was just a fork of an existing coin that already worked so we knew it would work it's just like like no one cares about this and then that wasn't true like a lot of people cared about it instantly and obviously like you know you're talking about the the current scene with nfts and all this stuff is like no no way we would have thought anything like this would happen it was it was all just a bunch of nerds like being silly with each other it's basically a drop basically what you're saying is it was like a drop you know it's like we were talking style like i saw your thread on mischief that company that does those drops every week yeah it's basically that you basically were like let's have some fun i'm gonna like change a few things add a story to it and press compile and go to sleep and then you wake up and it just you know it starts spreading yeah pretty much like fascinating to look at the chart though like i've got the chart up of all time and so like what year was that that you actually did the draw that you december uh 8th 2013. okay so i'm looking at the chart and basically like i i can't even give you what the scent was for a single doge because it's too many decimals like it was december okay so on december uh 28 i can't really quite zoom in on january 1st 2014 so a few weeks later it was at point zero zero zero three and my eyes are like glazing over because of the number zeros and basically for you know from then until uh there was a little spike in 2018 when it got up to almost one cent which is like probably a huge jump i mean you must have been at that point like the 24 hour volume was 300 million dollars like you must have been thinking this is wild um and that felt crazy and then in january 2018 it crossed into one cent territory but then it went back down and it was below a cent and then all of a sudden like i'm pulling up the chart in 2021 the thing goes from you know on january 1st it's under a penny and it goes from there over the span of that month basically like by february 1st it's at 7 cents and from there it goes from 7 cents to by may almost what like 70 cents 75 cents it goes up to like what i mean what are you thinking as this is happening uh so i sold all my cryptocurrency in 2015. like when there's this big bear market included yeah bitcoin i had a bunch of bitcoin a bunch of litecoin and i was just like whatever uh like this this is a bear market was like three years uh at that point so yeah you know the people freak out now if it's like two days of bear markets like oh god this is the worst it's like and then they make fun of anybody who sells during it is like yeah try three years try having a bear market for three years and seeing if you like you know want to hang on to it uh and basically i had uh i got laid off for my job and then like i was like kind of panicking because i was watching my bank account go down uh i had moved to california so my rent was like pretty expensive uh so i was like oh that's right i have all this like cryptocurrency so i just got rid of all of it and got the cash and felt a little more comfortable which was a terrible thing um but uh yeah so basically when all this stuff happened like 2018 happened and like crypto was going crazy and all the icos were happening and my friends knew about it so they'd be like oh what do you think of this i'm like oh my gosh like this is pain this is like i mean it's fine like you know good for it good for people who are in the space but for me it's like ah that sucks that's oh my god okay so i need okay well i i don't mean to add insult to injury here um at all but like i read an article and so like just the general background on this i find incredible because you're out here you're still clearly a public figure you're doing fine you have a job like things are things are good um and elon musk follows you on twitter which like basically no one can say so like i need to bow down to you as a result of that so if elon is out there actually and he sees this episode um that would be great as well because i think he'll find it hilarious but i i did see an article um when i was researching for this about the fact that you sold all your dogecoin and um you bought a car and when i was looking at it i was like okay so you you know you sold your dogecoin you bought a car i think it was a honda civic in the article which who knows maybe they're maybe they're making it exciting for the article cnbc whatever it was uh but then like during the spike in 2021 that dogecoin that you sold would have been worth enough to buy honda and it cracked me up when i saw it because it was such an example of the absurdity of some of these things where i mean there was like no rhyme or reason to it the memes control the world like elon musk went on i think it was joe rogan's podcast near maybe a clubhouse room or something where he talks about like um you know he who controls the memes controls the world like the dune line um and it really all of a sudden i mean it took over in 2021 um where like meme you know like greg called it memes of production um it's so fascinating to me though to see it in real time and to see it with you know a case study like this with what you went through yeah a couple things with that uh so the honda civic thing is hilarious because it's usually a picture of jackson my co-founder and then saying like billy marcus sold all his holdings for a honda civic and that was like kind of a misquote because i i didn't want to say the exact amount it was about like ten thousand dollars so i'd say like about as much as i sold all my crypto for about as much as you know it could cost a buyer used honda civic and then that just became the meme it was like a picture of jackson's control of the world yeah the theme strikes again the meme strikes again exactly well that is i mean that like that it's such a classic like media thing like click baity headline of like sold and bought honda bought used honda civic could have bought all of honda it's such an absurd i mean i get it i get why they do it actually it does drive clicks i clicked on it yeah i think it's kind of funny so sometimes i just roll with this like yeah people like how's your honda i'm like i don't know never had one never had one before my father wants to sponsor me like i'm down whatever yeah it is funny we talked on one of our first episodes greg you remember this um like talking about um it was like the idea of like lost porn and like man in the arena stuff with howard in that first episode that we dropped when you know like we all now everyone loves to share gains and like talk about their amazing wins and things like that but it's so interesting because now i think like reddit you know with wall street bets people are actually sharing their like massive l's and the things that they sold to earlier the big l's they're taking and it's become like a point of pride for a lot of people to kind of share those um and i find i mean i think it's like healthy actually um societally that people are doing more of that billy yeah billy do you do you see it as an l because like i look at it i'm like how many people get to like create a meme and spread it you know that for well i mean first of all it's enduring like it's been years at this point and you know hundreds of millions of people have seen it i'm just curious like how do you feel i i don't mean you know how do you feel about it all um so in terms of the the lost porn part of it or just that as part of culture i agree that i think that's a good thing uh that people are like more realistic about it it's not like oh we always just make money because everything goes up all the time i think it's good that there's a reasonable thought of like this is pretty much gambling um in terms of like what i think uh it's just weird like it from from my position i just kind of made something eight years ago and then eight years later it went crazy and elon musk was talking about i'm like okay like it's just a very like like all right i guess i'm in this position now and then like when i tweet stuff and people are responding to me i'm like that's weird like people are listening to me i'm just some nerd like sitting in my underwear most of the time or on the toilet tweeting random crap so it you know it's just it's like i it's kind of like but that's what i love about the internet that's like that's the amazing thing about the world we live in too like dude i mean i'm looking at i'm pulling it up right now you created something which i mean how many people in the world can say this you created something that today has a market cap of 22.5 billion dollars and traded two billion dollars of volume um i texted my friend um uh david mcdonough is the founder of this business common stock that's an awesome you know free platform for investment knowledge they're a supporter of the show because he gets a ton of retail investing data through their through their platform and the integrations and he said that doge was the over the past 12 months the fourth most traded asset across all retail brokers and exchanges and it was it beat out by the way it beat out apple amazon and the spy index the s p 500. um it was literally behind tesla bitcoin and ethereum um which tesla is like a meme in and of itself obviously so i mean it shows it goes to show though like what you did create whether or not you profited from it as you know as much as anyone would have liked i mean it's pretty insane like the numbers on it are bananas yeah uh i remember seeing a graph of like the most searched thing in the united states uh for various ports of time and during the year on google and dogecoin like like april may and part of june was the most searched thing like in the entire united states which is like oh okay this is like everyone knows what it is now um i just sound like an anecdote actually uh when i first came to california there was a dogecoin uh hackathon and i wasn't invited or like i just kind of came as a whim and like i went there and uh they were like oh are you on this list i'm like no but i'm billy marcus they're like uh okay i'm like yeah like i made dogecoin and they're like oh okay and like you know eventually let me in but it's like they didn't no one knew what it was like it wasn't a thing that's like a common knowledge and now it is like most people know or have heard of dogecoin and have some either an opinion on it or think it's like like what the heck was going on i know that that's true because i said it before i came in to record this i told my wife i was recording an episode and i was like hey just just so you know i'm filming something and she's like oh who are you chatting with and i was like billy marcus and she was like oh who's that said the founder of dogecoin she was like is that that dog cryptocurrency and my wife knows nothing about this stuff and i was like yeah and she's like oh so and so like my friend was buying a bunch of it and i was just like okay so it clearly has entered the zeitgeist because my wife does not touch any of this stuff or know anything about it but she knew what it was so yes you've definitely uh you've definitely crossed the chasm as it were yeah that's cool and also like uh most of the companies that i've worked for because i work for a lot of startups uh since coming to california like every once in a while i think like huh the thing i made in a couple hours is worth more than this company i mean it's worth more than a lot of companies by the way i mean 22 billion dollars no the trading volume is what's bananas to me too i mean two billion dollars today is um is just crazy like do you do you ever think and i again i'm not like trying to rub rub this in like do you think about the fact that you like it would be worth billions of dollars today or your stake in it or is it just something that you're like yeah i mean it's so long ago and you created and it was a joke and it still is a joke i mean it's like openly a joke but it became a meme um do you think about it ever uh so my my personal stake would have like at max at about six million uh this because of like uh when those articles came out they're like oh uh let's take the entire market cap of those going to attribute it to billy marcus it's like yeah that's not how it works yeah but uh to your point though like uh i think it was uh i wouldn't call it like like terrible but it was just kind of like like my mom was struggling uh last year uh with like house payments essentially and uh it was like oh i can i can help you but like it's kind of difficult for me uh to you know pay for your your mortgage while uh also paying for all my expenses to california so when dogecoin was getting unpopular it's like yeah i could have you know done it easily if i just had this um but fortunately i was able to make it up by selling nfts and stuff and i was able to pay off her house and so that was like everything i would have ever wanted so at this point everything's gravy like doesn't you know i have a decent job and everything's fine so yeah regrets or anything right you got to know more people yeah yeah twitter people hitting like buttons and and sometimes i'm giving you something amazing about it that's like um i don't know i mean like memes control the world in a very this is like the most visceral example of that that um you created something and honestly there was no reason other than like elon musk starts tweeting about it people start thinking it's funny i saw someone recently say that like the funniest outcome is the most likely outcome now um with all of these things and i think about it now a lot with investing of like are is this company like are there memes and virality that happen around this company and like i um i've talked to greg about this before like i i'm a big believer in this new asset class around like event contracts and i invested in this platform called calci that is like the only cftc regulated platform and their whole thing you know like what i'm trying to talk to them about is like there's so much interesting memeable content here where people are trading on these like binary events and you're getting into things and there's these like crazy charts of when things are swinging and like harnessing memes now has to be a core strategy at some of these companies that are trying to grow because all of a sudden you can just you know shoot things to the moon out of the blue from just capturing the zeitgeist at one moment in time yeah i would like memes are the language of the internet essentially and i think you know the the previous term for all this stuff was virality right like the cheapest marketing is to have something go viral and the cheapest and most effective and often really scary for companies to have to try to scale after they go viral like oh no like a jillion people are looking at my stuff so uh i think in that way it makes sense like if like uh one thing i noticed in general is if i'm trying to express a point on twitter with my 280 characters usually if it's nuanced it's like pretty hard and you know people people will read your threads because you you do a good job of like prefacing it with like what you want to say and getting people interested with your you know 19 things of whatever but uh mine are like you know like here are three three tweets in a row and like no one understands it but if i make a meme people understand it it's like oh okay like the the picture is worth a thousand words uh it gives all this context and it's just like way more efficient at expressing what you want to say so i really do think means memes are powerful and like can't be denied just just like you know being viral is really really important in marketing billy what is a meme can you you know for all the people listening like how do you define a meme uh there's like the the you know like old school definition of a meme which is just like any idea that's spread essentially so like everything's a meme um but uh like memes nowadays are more just like um like a picture uh or an image of some sort that expresses something that's usually kind of funny or kind of true uh in a in a way that is easy to comprehend very quickly um yeah i don't really know if that's a good definition but it's kind of how how i think the definition at the moment yeah and like doge means yeah it captures in an image something that you know a bunch of words couldn't say yeah um but it doesn't have to be an image i don't think right like i think like to me a meme is a spreadable idea the format could be a video it could be an image it could be you know a letter which is basically would you say you're like um you understand like when it comes to you know nerd culture programming culture you're kind of like an expert like you you you understand that culture really well so you can create memes for them really well would you say that no i mean not necessarily i think if you're obsessed with something uh for example i was like really into starcraft 2 for a while so i could make starcraft 2 memes because i understood like the nuance of that particular subculture i think that's where memes are like i can make dogecoin memes now or like crypto memes right now because it has a very specific subculture and like people can relate to specific things if i if i make them in a meme image um so that's what i agree so i think that i think the reason you were able to create dogecoin in two hours is because you had such a deep connection and understanding of that community that it was just second nature to you that's what i think what do you think billy um so he's he's humble man he's humble he doesn't want to give himself be honest be honest that's my outside perspective my outside perspective is like like you knew or you know you and jackson knew that like that dog had a good chance of um and the name and just like the whole bit and all the nuances that you said in this in the contract and like the words here and the words there together that had a good chance of spreading not not quite like it was it was like a it was more of a feeling if this has to exist than a feeling of like this will work and this will be popular because the bitcoin community at that time had no sense of humor whatsoever it's just like you know the the least funny community in history so like that having something that's supposed to be funny like like i wouldn't think that would work in that context but it had uh excitement outside of that little like subculture so and actually this is true in my opinion is that dogecoin has done an amazing service to the cryptocurrency community of like getting more people into cryptocurrency than ever would have if bitcoin was just bitcoin and like those people that were really into it that's a great point yeah it provided i mean it's a lot of what companies are trying to do now it's like providing rails the memes provided rails into this new world and it provided like a logical on-ramp to the point where my wife is talking about cryptocurrency um as a good example of it like normal people on the street my parents probably know what dogecoin is and that's interesting and that's like hugely hugely valuable to the space and so again to your point on like what you created having lasting value it's interesting i want to pitch you guys on an idea i've been having and this like meme conversation is so ripe for exactly what i'm talking about we're talking about memes control the world like memes are driving massive flows of money memes are influencing behavior so my idea is why don't you go and roll up these meme accounts like go and find the best meme accounts that exist on twitter on instagram on tiktok like parrik patel on twitter i love pyrik the like greg guy that did the no way jose thing to jose canseco um the liquidity um on instagram and on twitter like these people that are capturing the set of emotions the zeitgeist that are really good at just like over and over again putting out these memes that capture attention they have so much collective clout individually they're like sort of small and subscale i'm not sure there's a ton of like monetization there but if you could roll them up even if you like de facto brought them into a partnership together you could i think sway you know individual kind of companies trajectories perception uh you know markets around things if you actually like brought together the collective clout of these meme accounts so why not go and like roll them up go and like like create a fund and go and either buy or like you know kind of have them roll a stake into a collective entity where you can then just go like leverage the power of memes to move markets and it's i don't mean move markets in like an illegal context i literally mean you know they all go get behind an individual company and they're creating memes around it i think you could genuinely drive and accelerate outcomes for those companies that's interesting i would uh i would push back only like in general i think the idea makes sense uh my pushback is that i think what attracts people to accounts like that are they aren't trying to do anything specific other than be funny and if one of those accounts like just decided to like like okay my you know my riffs that i do all the time that are funny are now ford and i will just talk about ford and make ford memes that would like kind of tank the value of the account this would be like okay that's just like the ford chill and that's kind of uh not as interesting not that that that is exactly what you're saying but like it's it's like with reddit marketing like there's a lot of people that want to market on reddit but you can't just like go in there like hey everyone buy my stuff you have to like make it funny or make it viral in some way otherwise no one cares about it because they want things to come off authentically and not like you know you're part of the man type thing so i think it's yeah have you heard of uh doing things media have you guys heard of that one uh-huh they own like middle-class fancy [ __ ] steve um like a bunch of these brands trash can paul i'm looking at cats doing things um they have a similar model where they buy the accounts and what they do is they keep usually it's like a 15 year old guy in his basement but they keep that person on you know on board um so they plug the style they apply your strategy around like let's go buy accounts but they're very like it's basically they're combining sahel your idea with billy's kind of like but keep it keep it you know pure billy what you're basically saying is like the purity rules everything in meme land and i totally agree with that um our company um we we actually create uh accounts around memes all the time so we created um something called i need plans i don't know i've ever told you about this i remember this go for it this is awesome um so yeah we created an account um that got hundreds of thousands of followers you can follow it on uh you know on multiple platforms but on one platform i like the best instagram i think it has almost 100 000 followers and it's just plant memes you know people are stuck at home and they're talking about plants and it's like once you have this plant account and and these people are like so into plants you can create a lot of businesses on top of it right like you can go and create you know an nft project you can create plant coin and start air dropping i don't know stuff into them you can create a d2c plan company i think like once once you control the attention um there is a lot you can do but it's tough to remain pure yeah i do think the um the purity point i it totally resonates with me and i think that's the challenge of it i just think about it in the context of like my own experience with meme accounts like this dr park patel account on twitter um i know the actual person behind it now and a lot of people recently have been saying that they think that i am the person behind the account which i find hilarious because i wish i was that funny and like and and innovative and i honestly wish i had that much time to do what he's done um but he he and i have this whole back and forth thing of like each other's wives that's like funny kind of like you know below bar humor and like you know college humor but like he'll comment on something i posted and be like oh yeah this is why your wife left you or something like that and he'll get like he won't ratio me but he'll get like 700 likes on something like that and for me it's like people hit me up and be like dude you should tell him to delete that like that's terrible that he got you like that and for me i'm like dude that actually just drove he has five 400 000 followers that drove so many new impressions to the thing that i had and like i don't care if a bunch of people like that it's funny like i think he's funny and it's a hilarious thing um but it drove so many more eyes to me so i almost think that like you don't even need to have them shilling the product like if it's ford you could have someone like that going in under the ford product and being like delete this this is dumb or like making fun of it and you know like trying to ratio the accounts and it would still drive so many net new eyes to it that you'd have this like net positive effect in the aggregate um created by something that was still genuine to the account yeah i i did notice like when i think you know may uh april may time period uh when my account was very popular or very high engagement if i just like commented on someone's tweet that i thought was funny it would like like raise up a lot and then kind of the you know the same thing happens to me if elon musk likes one of my tweets it's basically like this weird validation loop that happens where it's like like i made a tweet i thought it was funny and like no one cared and then you know three hours later elon musk lights it and all of a sudden like it gets like 30 000 likes i'm like okay it's like much people like well if elon musk liked it it must be funny type type feeling too well it pops up in all of his he has 69 million followers right nice nice um nice and he when he likes it it pops up onto a bunch of those people's you know maybe not 69 million maybe it's like uh i don't know like 42 million or something like that people see it and they get um you know a thing that says like this pops up and so now people that didn't see it do see it my biggest triumph of this entire year by the way of like the last 12 months was he commented on one of my things and i successfully defended getting ratioed and did not get rationed by elon musk and so that was like my number one triumph on twitter of the last year because he when he comes in and comments on things like he blasted jeff bezos and ratioed the hell out of him on something and i was like it was one of the funniest things i saw on twitter last year like the back and forth between the two of them with the little he did the like silver medal when he passed him in net worth um and i don't know i mean yes like i i think it's it's fascinating though and i think there's there's something from a business standpoint to rolling up these accounts that are like individually not particularly valuable and collectively have a lot of clout that could drive you know real value well yeah the thing you the thing you can do uh also is cross promote in like a in a pure way when you have the network um billy what were you saying oh like now and now you're making me paranoid because i just uh today got a million followers and now i'm thinking like congratulations man what a day you won the bet by the way congratulations yeah i came here just to you know to gloat but yeah now it's like oh no if like every every random stupid thing that i'm liking might show up on a million people's feed so like oh no i better be more stingy about what i like you dude you also follow 420 people by the way nice you follow 420 and you're followed by one million this is like a screenshottable thing right now shibatoshi nakamoto at billy m2k um man yeah that is a beautiful thing if you fall like it's i mean once you follow 420 people and you're followed by 69 million that would be slightly nicer but you've got a little ways to go yeah i actually have to unfollow somebody to follow someone new because i don't i don't want to get rid of my 420. yeah i think elon musk should go on a follow spree actually and get to like uh now he's at 70 million he grew uh that's unfortunate he could have he had a real memeable moment there if he got to 420 following and 69 million at the same time dude he went from 69 million to like 7 million or 70 million really fast yeah that was like they always say the first millions the hardest billy [Laughter] he's hurt by a billy one million have you ever seen speaking of memes have you ever seen that meme where like drake i think it was drake tweeted um the first millions the hardest and t boone pickens tweeted back at him saying uh the first billion is even harder or something like that i thought that was the funniest thing i was like he was like try the first billion or something it was like the most unnecessary flex but also hilarious that t boone pickens was tweeting at drake yes timo pic he's like the oil guy from like the 40s or something totally i think he passed away he's the late oil guy from there but yeah i mean like complete business legend but like total savage for coming at drake that way so that's further to the point on memes um man i uh i had a blast wait wait billy what do you do now what do you do now like what is what is the day-to-day in in in that's true actually i feel like we don't even know the end of the story not the end of the story the middle of the story i just i just work and like you know i'm uh working at home as a software engineer i make software or educational software for kids so that's my day job and then while things are compiling or if i go to the bathroom or if i'm just like procrastinating i'll just tweet that's basically my life this is all i do and why uh why not start like what's stopping you from starting a new project like you do have that itch um like you've started something it's it's hit critical mask you know do you and you have a million person following a million followers on the back of that yeah any interest in starting something new yes but uh one thing i i don't like about the cryptocurrency space in general and this includes nfts and every derivative of cryptocurrency is promising like over-promising so uh i don't like to promise anything i don't like to like hype things that i'm doing so like i might be working on something uh on my own time or whatever but if i do release something i'll just release it when it's done or ready because otherwise you know it is it's really great like joshua literally was made to make fun of how many of these like dumb same projects were out there hyping themselves up about how great they were going to be and how much they were doing and none of them did anything like almost every single one of them died and dogecoin was the only one who made it because it had a community and because it didn't make any promises because it was funny and fun like i made a community that like uh wanted to make it successful so yeah you had me at community village yeah you said greg's love word i mean to be honest billy like i think i i stand by it like i stand by the fact that i think that you have a deep understanding of community and the community that you were in at the time and and how to build memes for that particular community like you did it and i think that you did it once and i think you can do it again i appreciate that yeah i would buy into your next thing i will say that right now so you may not hype it publicly but if you are doing something new i want to know about it i will message you about a lot of people who would be interested in backing whatever it is that you do next you know i i'm very good at uh like getting interested in stuff before it becomes very popular and then getting uninterested in it before it explodes like esports or like magic cards or things like that and cryptocurrency so yeah maybe maybe i have something uh of my interest early that'd be interesting for people billy what uh yeah what in the cryptocurrency space that is like what's what's unattractive to most in the cryptocurrency space that you find potentially attractive like what are people sleeping on um actually it's starting to become bigger now um i do think there's some like i played a lot of mmorpgs uh like world of warcraft um and got sick of them and never wanted to play one again but the idea of like owning uh stuff from it and being able to like sell it to other people uh i think is massive so for example there's have you heard of vr chat so like vr chat is like a virtual world of like i don't know 4chan meets virtual reality this is kind of like this crazy uh virtual reality world i basically see the future as vr chat uh with nfts uh so vr chat but like you own like whatever that you you have on you and you can like show it off because in world of warcraft like people literally would get certain pieces of gear and then stand around this place called iron forge um and other people would like i loved it yeah and then people would be like where'd you get that cool mount or where'd you get that cool shoulder piece like that was enough to make people feel cool about themselves so imagine that plus like yeah this is like worth like 10 000 bucks and i could sell it i own this it's not owned by blizzard entertainment but it's owned by me so like like 3d virtual goods uh being able to actually status signal like it plays on a lot of human human emotions like natural biological things yeah and it's already proven like it's already proven to work in video games so like it will work um the only problem right now is the gamers tend to hate nfts so i think they're just going to be rebranded to like digital goods and then people decide that they like them uh not knowing that behind the scenes is blockchain tech and nft tech and stuff yeah it was super interesting i just pulled it up here while i was poking around i was a i was an og uh world of warcraft player um funny funny enough like the stanford baseball team when i was there especially my freshman year you know you like think you know jocks and like you know they're not nerds and don't do all that kind of stuff and we were like on road trips we were all like sitting on the floor of the bus and in rooms playing world of warcraft on our laptops and being like dude dude iron forge like we gotta go to do this quest whatever it was and it was a blast and i actually still miss playing that game yeah what what what a race in in god uh jeez this is like you're you're dating me now i'm not i have no idea i have no idea well this is 09. yeah good good company uh vitalik uh the creator of ethereum um he was a warlock in world of warcraft and uh blizzard nerfing siphon life was one of the uh reasons that he decided to make ethereum he was like mad that the centralized group like had the control to nerf something so he was like well this decentralization would be better so he went on to fascinating we got to get him on an episode for this greg we uh yeah that's a good it's a good call out if you um i have two two closing questions for you billy number one um if you could say one thing to elon musk that he might hear through this what would you say oh i don't know just like thank you for uh enjoying dogecoin uh thanks for for having fun i i think to me elon musk appreciates dogecoin because it's silly and because it's ironic and because it's funny and fun which is what i would like people to appreciate judge crane for not like just be like looking at the money that they potentially could make or could lose because that's kind of fun but not i don't know it's kind of crazy uh but you know just like the fact that it's funny and has a community that's just interested in screwing around and making memes um i think he appreciates that about it so i appreciate it appreciate it yeah he appreciates it for the pure reasons that you created it around which is like he likes it for what it is which is that's cool um last question that we ask everybody um five year predictions like what are what are your predictions for the future um anything that jumps out to you that you think about for the future it could be this you know thing around nfts vr chat etc like what do you think you know five years from now we're going to be um really excited about as a uh as a human race oh man that's so hard so in terms of like crypto prices uh i always just answer the shrug emoji because i have no idea i sold in 2015 so it's not like i know anything about what what's gonna happen in the future uh but in terms of like uh what i think is cool uh it probably would be something related to i do see i don't think blockchains will take over games because not every game would be good with that there's a lot of problems with security and botting and all that stuff to that would ruin uh the you know purity of games themselves but i do see blockchain gaming becoming um bigger uh in general and you know people wanting to like just play video games and earn money which is my dream when i was 12 years old so i just play video games yeah play to earn i mean we we had um elections yeah we've talked to jiho and alexis who have both been you know around play to earn quite a bit obviously it's a fascinating space i do think the like getting people over getting gamers over the um apprehension around you know and concentration that they have around nfts and around you know this space in general i think is is going to be key it's interesting um there's a lot happening it's a great it's a great prediction i think it's i think it's a good one i know it's a hard question uh i appreciate it i got one last question for you billy um you mentioned i mean your steak would be worth six million dollars or so today if if you kept the the doge um it's a would you rather question so would you rather have the six million dollars in a bank account plus compound interest but no one had would ever heard of you billy you're no one like would know that you're the creator of dogecoin or would you rather the you know used honda amount of money but you're in the same position you are today you've got a million followers you're following for you know 420 people and elon musk sometimes likes your tweets um i would rather have the six million bucks and be anonymous i think like like i when i came back um to men because i was not on twitter for a really long time and i just got a bunch of you know emails telling me to cap dogecoin and like it was really annoying so i actually just came back to tell everyone to leave me alone but then found it was kind of fun and there was some cool people on twitter and i just kind of hung around and started [ __ ] posting but like really like i would rather just have money and be anonymous and not have to deal with this to be fair i think i think it was your best question the best um no i'd take the million followers and i i would take billy's current situation for sure because i think that you know his like his current status if uh if he wanted to and i i don't think this is what motivates you billy which is totally fine i i just think like you know you probably have six million dollars of annual you know income embedded in the value of what you're you know what where you exist today so i just i don't think it's necessarily what motivates you and what you want to do and the way you want to approach things but um i bet you could sell your you know your kind of influence and account for six million dollars to somebody probably so it's uh i don't know it's an interesting thing i'm going to dm you about this billy because i do want to talk more about it because i think it's interesting uh you want to buy my account don't you i want to change your mind on this answer that you just gave because it like personally hurts me a little bit um because i think you're amazing and i think there's i think you're way too humble for what you've done in your life as well which i i love and i think it's it's very endearing as well um but man i think you should you should be very proud of um of some of this stuff that you've uh you've been able to accomplish in a short time yeah well uh i i think a lot of people have that feeling too or it's like oh you have so much potential to do so much and i'm like i just want to play games and make video games make music and have everyone leave me alone yeah well it's why we like you man yeah it's awesome it was a blast getting to jam with you and yeah this is fun hear more of the story man you're um you're a legend and i'm congratulating you on winning our bet of reaching a million followers before me it was a [ __ ] bet just to be totally honest and i'm pissed i'll send you a dogecoin so that you're not you're not at zero um uh as a as a payment on the loss there yeah well let's uh let's race to two million then we can okay let's raise to two million that's fair we can make a public wager on two million um how about you own zero cryptocurrency well it's not a decent amount of ethereum actually no i have none let's just pretend i have none so i don't have to make it all right large bit let's do one eath on two million all right i'm gonna eat two million that sounds good okay all right i think hopefully in the next two years we'll it'll force us to stay in touch too this is great one heath on who hits two million first i'm a massive underdog elon musk if you're out there help me out give your boy a follow uh at saaho bloom on twitter help me get one eth from billy thank you sounds good thanks so much billy appreciate it where it happens thank you the saying used to be let

it's literally why i implemented the mmdd log made my day difficult log in every restaurant i've ever opened this was guidance from like a 1980s restaurant consultant where he'd say do an mmdd log let the staff tell you what makes their day difficult find the patterns fix it so literally every opening i had a clipboard at the back door before you left you had to write the one thing that made your day the most difficult sometimes the answer was me um luckily we had a culture where obviously people felt comfortable saying cat's confusing us with these instructions um but then i could find the patterns come back the next day fix the top few things or if i wasn't going to fix it say hey this is making everyone's day difficult here's why we can't fix it right now so i see you i hear you let's try to smooth it out around the edges but it's i actually can't change so don't spend your energy or i disagree maybe something bigger at the corporate level um i disagree that this should change here's why i've clearly done a bad job of explaining the benefits so i have used a literal version of the mmd d log for 20 years in business it's now a slack channel and all the companies i run and advise or an email if the culture isn't comfortable with an open slack channel i've used apps where you upvote and downvote what made people's day difficult the less change the more often you need to ask or the less change the less often you need to ask the more change the more often you need to ask so if there's a lot of going on it's made my day difficult every day and every day there's change if it's you know a little more spread out you can do it once a week once a month but this literally is soliciting feedback and building uh feedback magnets in the organization i do it in departments because not everyone needs to know about everyone's feedback but then department leaders need to talk and if there's something that is consistent across the company it rises to the level of the executive team it's also a start-up yeah like i'm i'm listening to you and i'm like okay cat like how do i invest you know like how do you productize this like i don't know if it's a slack bot or an email with like a dashboard the branding would be perfect um i see it now i love it i literally implemented this for decades it could literally be called like feedback magnet wait it's just a thing that gets dropped into 20 places in the organization feedback that's a cool idea

for fast growing startups and they should all check it out today so if you want to go look into it go to capchase.com dude i finally watched squid games okay what do you think i know i like i used to i used to talk trash about um like these uh subtitle shows because i couldn't do it um i always had trouble like reading while watching and um first off i realized that like after two minutes your mind just somehow adjusts to it and you just like naturally read and are able to watch the show so i've never really figured out how to do that until recently but it definitely happens and so like one thing i'm over that whole hold up on it and squid games is insane and i'm like i'm super late to this party i get it everyone talked about good games like several months ago and it's not that cool anymore but it's uh it's crazy i mean it's like a super interesting human uh really dark but like great quality good acting i was like i thought it was dope i mean i basically don't watch tv so i haven't seen squid games have you seen the mr beast squid games reenactment no you have to watch that have you seen the like whole all the hype around this like he released he just spent like seven weeks putting together like a real life reenactment of squid games obviously not killing people um but got like 100 million views in like 72 hours i did see that on twitter the stats on it were complete i mean that guy's legit visionary is that what got you into squid games you like saw it you're like oh i should probably watch that which is fascinating actually as like a case study on how creators can like add value to these platforms because he made the video he obviously did really well on the actual video the whole thing got sponsored 100 million views like he's making a bunch of money on it um but the amount of value that i imagine it added back in like driving a resurgence of squid games into the netflix platform and he's not getting or capturing any of that so it's kind of interesting like could you see a future where um these platforms actually like harness creators to go create cool viral content around it to drive people back yeah that gets me thinking of uh cc0 do you know what that is no so some nft projects have what's called creative commons which basically means that uh the community owns the rights to um to the product so you own a cryptos right and cryptodes like what that means is you actually don't own the ip to that cryptos nft anyone kevin our video guy could go and just print a hat with your cryptos on it and the thesis on it is that if you basically open source the ip that anyone could you know do things with it that more creativity is unlocked and then because of that there's just like more there's more memes around it and you know if there's more memes around it the value goes back to um [Music] you know the value goes back to the original sort of purveyor of the meme in this case cryptos another way to think about it is do you know the the remora the remora and shark relationship no so remora is like a fish that basically hangs on to sharks yeah the sticky thing that sticks on the side exactly like cleans it and eats the eats the parasites yeah it's the it's the definition of it's a definition of a symbiotic relationship so that's the idea is that the big shark is kryptodes and the little sharks are these like projects that are kind of built on top of it baby shark baby shine exactly um i think it's kind of a cool idea i don't um so i guess the analog i would use in like a real world uh would be like people that are creating replicas of certain artwork or certain collectibles and that actually drives more people and drives value of the actual like but but i don't really know the right way to think about it in a in an nft sense i agree with you though like the nouns thing that we talked about like jack butcher our friend uh you know created these like nouns sweatshirts and hats and different things that nouns are like the red glasses that are like cool kind of pixelated things also cco yeah yeah okay so very cool because then you have a bunch of people out there wearing these things and some of them actually own things that are nouns some of them don't but hugely valuable to the ecosystem around it because it adds this coolness and this vibe to it um so i do feel like there's something there it's an interesting concept though for like netflix or these other platforms that are trying to gain share to collaborate on to like seed interesting creators to create things that stoke viral intrigue in the product it's sort of like guerilla marketing yeah i mean i think i think that's the future of hollywood is like it's not you're not guar super guarded on your ip right you make it more open i remember i once 2000 like four or five i drove down from montreal to burlington vermont to go see a third eye blind concert love third eye blind by the way semi-charmed life is still like one of my favorite songs of all time so i'm there i'm at the concert with like my best friends and i had just gotten a audio vox cell phone with a camera on it um i even think i actually i brought a digital camera as well like an actual digital camera and i was really stoked and then when we got there the venue higher ground in burlington vermont we like me and my friends started taking pictures and they were like there's no pictures and it was this whole big thing where third eye blind doesn't want anyone to take pictures and i remember thinking back then like 20145 whatever it was like that doesn't make any sense like the more pictures i take and share on social the better it is for you right like i'm taking pictures of their of of you the singer of third eye blind i'm posting i'm like i had such a great time like and i think uh that's kind of the same aha moment i'm having with a lot of like hollywood productions where you're either like very guarded or unguarded and the ones that are gonna win are going to be unguarded are there platforms this is it's making me want to ask a question to you you might know the answer you might not are there platforms or like infrastructure for small companies to track and manage their ip so like disney has thousands of people that are dedicated to this probably and are like constantly tracking hits on different ip and what it's doing and the value of it but like if you're a small creator or you're a small web 3 project or you're like up and coming you don't really you have all this ip you have it out there in the wild maybe you're just a startup actually and you have your brand or your logo uh whatever it might be like are there platforms that allow you to actually track uh hits on that ip the like perceived value of it because the ip by the way um in traditional financial services context has value like you can go get a loan against ip and actually have cash that comes in from it so i wonder whether you could build a platform um because i haven't seen it exist that actually just helps companies especially content related companies track and manage and like kind of leverage the value of their ip more readily i haven't seen anything i think what you're describing is basically like hootsuite but for ip so instead of tracking like tweets instagram posts whatever you're tracking like your digital ip yeah or non-digital ip yeah in like a really like nice dashboard probably a great business idea there it's kind of like a niched down version it's like a kind of cool little niche though but like um you know every startup does the whole like in the wild thing where like they have their slack channel or whatever they're operating on and they're like oh i saw i don't know swag up in the wild and you're like saw the picture of this thing or like oh i saw a party round sticker in the wild or mercury in the wild whatever it is and that there's actually something really powerful in that right like if you are seeing it in the wild more being able to actually track and manage the value of that and track the perceived value of what you're creating and then figure out like what are the levers we can be pulling to increase that value it's kind of a cool idea i think like the bigger idea slash framework is that there's some you know you started off by saying like disney has thousands of employees probably doing this thing and it's like how do you take basically that software that they've built that's proprietary and bring it to everyone else so the idea like the framework for it is like what are what are you know and facebook is notorious for this stripe is notorious for this where they have amazing internal software and just bringing that to everyone else this is this is an amazing framework so this is like um i forget who i recently talked about it might have been like our friend sean pourie that i talked about this with but i don't know it was bobac um we have a friend bobac who is an investor debut capital um small fund that's doing all black and latinx founders and they backed this company squire it's like this barbershop platform and basically it's for like mom and pop type barber shops and it brought the like management tool software of huge salons and barbershops like big chains and scaled that down so that any mom and pop could have the best in class tool and that like he was talking about it in the context of that that is a very cool framework for starting businesses go find like what the largest company is doing and doing really well so in this case disney what are they using for ip management defense ip defense would be a part of this of like who's infringing on your ip and not using it appropriately and then um figure out what that looks like and what's like the atomic unit of that that you could bring and give to startups as a small tool or give to um you know smaller companies as a tool yeah and maybe that's the case for like going to work at one of these big companies it's like you're getting a first hand look at the potentially greatest internal software and then you can just use that and bring it to different verticals yeah or you just go talk to 20 people at some of these companies but like i think the coolest version of this actually would be for for creators so i like it for startups i think it's interesting because they have cash and their stuff but like an up-and-coming mr beast he's bigger now an up-and-coming mr beast is producing all this content um all of it is kind of their face or their brand around it they might be tick-tock youtube they have it across all these different channels people are resharing it taking the videos doing like talking about mr beast stuff whatever it is all over these different platforms can you give them a tool that allows them to track and manage all of their personal name brand creator ip that exists out there so that they can kind of track their like perceived net worth almost in the value of like what they're building as a personal brand yeah i would even do it like give it away for free just get like everyone on it yeah um and then monetize how like you could monetize i guess on the back of that with sponsor you like you you become the connection point because you're tracking the value of ip so you know um all of the hits on it you're able to then be like a marketplace that's connecting different brands in for the actual ads on it um you could help them actually by like connecting them with services to scale the quality of their ip because you're constantly in the flow of seeing what they're producing and how it's being reused and how much and the k factor on all of it um yeah it's interesting i like it financial services stuff on the back of it it's kind of an interesting thing yeah i like that framework a lot though just to like double down on that of go find what the huge company is doing that they're doing extremely well and that they've probably spent tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars developing plus hundreds of people go find that and niche that down into a product that is like just what is exactly needed for smaller players like you don't need the disney full suite of services probably if you're a creator or if you're a startup so you find what is like the atomic unit of that that works really well that's valuable and you go pull it down into the smaller universe and make it freemium like make some free component like for example i'm an investor in a company called vid iq which is basically started off as like a free chrome extension for creators to see you know on youtube specifically um [Music] what is their vid iq score they have this kind of you know unique score what are their video tags and it just allows like it's competitive analysis for the video space and they started up by giving out for free and then they started adding like paid products and stuff like that but i think that like obviously the best way to like win a market is just to like give it away for free and then as you're learning about it then you just add paid products monthly subscription and like vid iq is an example that business is absolutely crushing it totally agree two huge opportunities i see in two totally different industries to apply this one twitter analytics so there's like ilo is one that i've seen follower wonk is another no offense to them but like i i've used both and i just think there's a lot to be wanted from the platform and so i think you could go create like a beautiful intuitive version of that it's free up to 10 000 followers and then if you have more than that you need to pay um and just create like exactly what a massive brand is using to track and manage other social like hootsuite or whatever but you kind of have brought it down to something that's very actionable for a twitter creator go talk to a hundred people that have a scale following talk to me talk to greg talk to whoever and figure out what exactly we would use and need like we're booking guests for our show i really want to be able to search by location find who lives there what they do like how big their influence score is like all these different things that i can kind of do it with ilo and with follower wonk but it's not great and it's not quick and easy and i can't like plug in an assistant to do it or do something like that so i think that's one opportunity that could be really big the other one would be transportation and logistics like i've talked to i have a driver who kind of helps me a lot in new york i talk to a bunch she drives for uber i talk to her about all her problems and one of the biggest issues she has she's trying to figure out how to scale her own time as she builds her business right now it's just a time for money trade for her and she's doing well but she wants to take it to the next level but she keeps telling me like oh but it's such a headache if i hire someone then like dispatch and dealing with bookings and dealing with when they're driving our private clients and doing all of that would be really difficult and i was asking her like what exists there has to be a software that you can do this and she said limo assist is the main one people use in new york and so i went and looked at it and it literally like it says been around 35 years whatever it's like this old company that's been around for forever i'm sure it's fine for like taxi companies and these old you know dial seven the old stuff but like if you are a young one she's a young woman that's trying to build this she's tech savage she's digitally native why doesn't just a very simple dispatch and like driver management tool exist where you could like take what the big huge limo companies are using and just scale it down to this yeah i think whenever you hear that like the word headache basically it's like a light bulb should go off in your head where you're like okay amazing startup opportunity right there so i think with this in particular like yeah it makes complete sense yeah and you could go i mean that doesn't have to be a venture-backed business by the way like you could probably build that with low code no code tools figure out like whatever the dispatch looks like figure out some algorithm for it with one or two people and then go find a hundred drivers to test it out and you could pretty quickly figure out whether it works or not and do it in a geo focus start in new york start wherever and see if you could scale something maybe it already exists but the fact that this woman was like limo cis is the option i pulled it up on my phone i'm like it's not mobile enabled the website i'm like scrolling didn't fit the screen and right away i was like oh my god a non-mobile-enabled website from a company that's supposed to be the de facto player like red flag well that's another like sign right like that's like a really that's i've never even thought about that but if like go like find mobley unoptimized websites in like for big businesses and like if you're you're looking for a business idea like go compete with them right and just make it like digitally native mobile first this is our friend nick huber's uh thing where he says uh you go like see who's still who has a fax number on their on their like page or if you go to their facility and they have like a fax machine there you just know that they're ready to be disrupted it's like the exact same framework to short those companies yeah seriously i mean you short them by going and attacking their market share um but i think this is interesting so um i know we've riffed on this for a while we have a awesome guest coming in yeah um one of my favorite people in the world cat cole incredible like multi-disciplinary thinker she's been an operator she's been an investor she's a life coach ceo whisperer i mean she's done so many different things and i know it's going to be a wide-ranging discussion i do want to get her perspective on a bunch of this stuff i want to talk to her about the whole idea of like niching down things that exist for huge companies and i think in the context of coaching that idea is really interesting like ceos tim cook jeff bezos they have ceo coaches that are these incredible people we're talking to them why doesn't that exist down for normal people middle managers like up-and-coming startup ceos and so i think there's an interesting concept to kind of go deeper with her on that given her specific knowledge cool yeah i mean i've had a coach for a while too so would love to get her opinion on it personal experience love it all right let's bring her in cool what is marlow so marlo is an essentially an atomized coaching app okay and they take the mechanics of coaching so feedback 360 feedback metrics ongoing feedback reporting directly to the person and basically have digitized the non-kind of like non-unique elements of coaching and are putting it in hundreds of companies and taking coaching all the way down to the like the i don't want to say the word lowest common denominator but to any level of people manager and spreading it throughout the organization a cost effective way there is a human coach element but you get all this feedback that's just automatic and then recommended steps but then you get a coach once a month but it's being spread across that whole company and so there are these other insights right if you have a coach that's spending 30 minutes with you 30 minutes with you the coach is going to be able to step back and give the executive team some insights like hey in addition to what the data is saying about your 200 people managers i'm talking to 50 of them and here are some common themes so the there are like actual insights and data and then there's still a human element which scared away some investors at first um but it if you talk to any any big company that is the issue is that there is still an element of confidential reflection that's needed for a manager to process what they're seeing even if you give them really great data i'm just on their website i love how specific they are so like you go to the website it says you can't even see the website until it says every manager deserves a coach which is like kind of a hot take you know and it's like put your name and email to actually access the actual website um so you access it and so you put in your your email they're like check your inbox they send a pdf overview of like why and i love i love that they're just starting with the why yeah it's interesting it is really interesting and it's also an interesting example of i guess there's a couple interesting things that i draw by the way i'm not an advisor or an investor mentoring jason calcanis's launch 21 yeah um and was so blown away that's cool i heard that i had a follow-on i didn't see that one i saw um there's a business called scale that's doing coaching um uh chief product officer i think from tinder um was starting it that was pretty interesting they were raising money recently you should meet with them and chat with them at some point super interesting i've always thought about these as like the consumer facing side which is like a marlow or a scale where um you have to like win customers and marlo sounds interesting because they're kind of taking the b2b approach like going and landing the client then you can go and get as many people as you want it can be b to c or b yeah and it gets smarter as you have more people on it and there's product-led growth within the organization because i'm like if me and greg are in the same company and they're offering this and i'm not using it and i'm not growing as much as greg and he's getting promoted suddenly i'm like oh [ __ ] i gotta get on this thing i gotta be using it in the same way for sure so it's kind of a smart selling tactic the other approach would be just going infrastructure layer and saying um like practice which i'm a investor in full disclosure julian smith the founder of breather has started this thing and it's infrastructure for coaches and it's you know managing their bookings managing that whole experience which again goes to this whole idea of taking what massive people probably have expensive software and all these things and bringing it down to any coach so if i'm a coach and i have 10 clients i need a way to manage bookings and retention and track all of that and so they're building a product for that small subgroup basically taking a bet on and this is the reason i like infrastructure personally i know coaching is going to be a much bigger thing 10 years from now than it is today because people are starting to get more in tune with their own personality traits feedback being an important thing uh spirituality as an aspect of it and that was always a thing where you were like oh no i'm tough i gotta just grind through it whatever put my head down like hustle culture was kind of the last iteration and now we're realizing no that's not the way to grow and so the infrastructure to me is a cool play on it because then you don't i don't have to bet on who wins i just get to bet on hey the space is going to be 10 times as big in a few years and so i want to ride that wave yeah it's it's also interesting this division of coaching the life coach versus the career manager coach and where should they overlap for scale i mean it's hard to get away from the psychological element but not all coaches have the same level of capability training summer therapists some are not it's really interesting when you get into coach and people like what kind like am i gonna have someone making me draw circles and talk about my dad and you know all of this stuff or is someone just going to help me be a better people manager and is there a way to do that without any of the life coach so what do you guys think about that i've never had a coach so i want to ask your opinions on this of like what do you think i don't know if you want to go this deep into somebody else's there are a lot of people who consider you whether or not you're formally their coach they consider you a coach and uh probably both a life coach to talk to them about challenges of becoming a operator ceo investor all the things you've done but like what do you i mean you have a coach or you've had a coach yeah is it a life coach is it a purely executive coach is it both i mean i feel like for us like our lives and our personal lives and professional lives really bleed yeah into one so i feel like having a coach that's just focused on professional doesn't really make sense anymore yeah i mean at some point you're going to hit a wall you're getting those conversations where it's like okay what i'm what we're working on has deeper roots than this business exactly so we're gonna have to break through the dirt and that's when you get into this personal like [ __ ] going on at home or um there is something from your childhood that's causing a behavior that you don't realize that all your people are picking up on and reflecting back to you it's it's almost impossible to stop at the surface exactly i had a i had a coach for a few years and that coach like helped me basically sell my last company islands to wework like just through the whole process and i would say like 30 of the stuff we worked on was literally business like tactical professional stuff and 70 was like hey like why are why do you want to sell the company oh it actually stems from this you know uh you want validation or something you know and and and really like prying and that's why like yeah i think the best coaches do have that personal plus uh professional kind of way of thinking about it and i think that's the harder part to do at scale yes you know something at a marlow or any of these companies that are breaking it down into its parts and getting feedback at some point it requires a human touch like a one-on-one you can't ai your way to like your issues with your mom needs to be intimate it needs to be intimate like there needs to be like trust like blind trust like completely blind trust that's what's interesting about marlowe are platforms like it where they're pairing together the human coaching element with the data-driven feedback the process orientation and that is scaring away some companies and it's scaring away some investors but i think it's the right way right i think it's the way to do it right over time it just may slow down what i like about marlow is that it it's getting people who wouldn't have a coach something yeah so it's like get them started and then from there like let them potentially oh oh you know i never thought a coach would actually be you know valuable it's that tagline on the on the website the statement of to your point where the world is going why shouldn't everyone have access to some form of professionalized structured rooted in expertise feedback and then some guidance with what to do with that feedback i mean that has its own limitations but if every manager had that from the time they began managing got used to soliciting feedback receiving it and doing something about it like ask answer act and being a part of a culture where that's normal imagine what they would be like when they're executives and ceos and there has to be like the point you made about investors being scared off by the fact that there's a human element here cracks me up because it's like first off i just think that's dumb yeah but there's huge businesses now being built around mental health as an example for companies like um spring health lira are both multi-billion dollar companies backed by like tiger and some of the biggest you know investors in the world and clearly there's a human aspect that's selling basically b2b mental health services and then there's actual you know mental health coaches psychiatry like i think there's actually clinical aspects to it but clearly that's human and everyone knows that has to be feminine so it's almost like it's almost it seems like a silly pushback where people just think oh coaching and feedback can be automated and so it should be and i'm not going to invest if there's a human element because it can't scale in an unbridled unhuman way right exactly but there has to be multiple billion dollar businesses within performance coaching as that industry becomes as big as it should be i i think about the lost gdp from the fact that there are people who are not maximizing their skills and they're leaving talent on the table because you have a you know in a big corporate you worked in a big corporation i've never done that but even in a you know finance org like i was at a private equity fund and then in that there are people that literally get left behind we talk about not leaving children behind when they're in school but that happens in organizations every single day thousands of people are getting left behind because they're not getting consistent feedback they're not given the tools to actually grow and get better at the things they're they're deficient in yeah and so to me i look at it and i say as an organization if i'm the ceo or a board member at a company i want this because it's making all my employees more productive and it's a no-brainer if i'm a person i want my company to have this because it's allowing me to scale up which i'm going to make more money and take care of my family so i care but i don't know how you could look at that and say oh there's no there's no billion dollar plus outcome within this industry because there's a human element that just feels short-sighted to me not to mention one of the greatest challenges of our time is labor and staffing at all levels and you talk to any founder any ceo any investor or board what are what are their biggest challenges they're in this bucket of finding talent and getting people coaches at all levels increases the likelihood that some of your talent moves up from within and you don't have to go find it externally and then the retention is higher and the cultural knowledge is higher and they're all it shouldn't be everyone but more from inside an organization should be able to move up than often do less catered lunches more coaching seriously like oh great i have my kombucha on tap and you have my like nice catered lunch who cares about that that's commoditized at this point this feels like the next layer of that like oh you're giving me things to level up my career to become better at the things that you're telling me i'm not great at giving me more consistent feedback um i recently read an article about becoming a feedback magnet and how the greatest leaders are feedback moments and magnets um siobhani berry i think was the person that wrote it um she runs a a course called ascend which is like a leadership program for women very very cool um and she wrote this great piece i think it was a first round review article they published it and it was this idea of being a feedback magnet and i've never thought about it that way of like the best leaders or feedback constantly wanting feedback because um there's so many times when you like shy away from it or scared of feedback because you feel like it's a criticism on you rather than flipping it the entire opposite way of this is a huge opportunity for me to get better at whatever it is i think there's there's a way to reframe feedback in not just someone having a shitty experience and having the courage to tell you and you having the gumption to digest it but literally feedback as in a radio it's signal it's just signal i mean when i worked for hooters and i was running the training department so i was a i don't know 24 year old director of training for the corporate office and when i would lead these workshops for managers and for franchisees whenever we would go on breaks we'd you know i'd go in the restroom pee in the stall and then stay in the stall so i could hear what people were saying and i never use the emperor i know it sounds creepy but i never used the information for evil i never told anyone um there was one time where i heard something that was against the law and so i had to do something about it pretty overtly but even if it was just people saying the music sucks on the break or these snacks aren't great or that guy in the corner is distracting granted i was only hearing the women's version because this is before the all gender restrooms but i still had feedback i had intel and then i magically corrected these things like it was just not about me sometimes the feedback was me man i wish you would stop saying that word that's so annoying or when she does this it's annoying and i'm like great to know fix just this constant constant iteration i've been so obsessed with the true truth which is other people's truth not mine and if and if you frame it that way one the ego is completely removed it's not about me it's about their experience and yes their experience is a reflection of me this is true for coaching managing putting on events audiences community whatever and just caring about their experience and then deciding what's signal versus noise you know where are the patterns versus the one-off and then doing something about it and so ask answer act sometimes ask is just listen and then create an environment or in my case eavesdrop on an environment where people are speaking the truth which they tend to do washing their hands in the restroom uh beside their classmates and then do something about it and just to your point of a feedback magnet and then soliciting it so doing check-ins and asking for it and that starts to not only give you the things to act on but it builds a culture where you don't have to ask for it as often how do you so i think it's i mean that's an amazing example first of super basic like makes sense that you were on like multiple episodes of undercover boss you were an undercover boss before you were an undercover that's true so many people have asked like wow did you learn something you know life-changing or transformational and and the answer is yes because of course the experience was unbelievable and i don't want to sound like an [ __ ] when i say but not really because i've i've always believed in being there in the trenches listening asking i don't typically have a wig on and really bad makeup to try to pretend i'm not who i am but when i was traveling around the world opening franchises every time i was in a country i'd never been there i was leading a team i had never met they had never met each other they were coming from all over the world to be a part of a team to open a new brand to launch literally a new entity and brand in a new country for the first time there is no trust there is no familiarity most people don't assume trust and start at 100 and give you a chance to go down they start at something lower and you have to build it and this idea of being able to build trust rally people around a common cause iterate as the experience evolves to get to a common outcome every time in a different place with a different team i was building that muscle when i was 19 years old because i you know there was no playbook like you have no choice you have to know the true truth you have to ask people for their experience because if they don't do the work the store doesn't get open and if you don't get feedback from them and understand their experience there's a lot of friction and to your point of productivity you don't have productivity and so coaching feedback check-ins like all these mechanisms to ask answer and act to listen and then iterate literally lead to the best leadership outcomes so i think 95 of people are sensitive to feedback i don't know if you agree or disagree i was gonna ask the same question and my question to you is how like what advice do you give to people to help them be less sensitive and it makes sense why they're sensitive it's like especially worse yeah especially if you're like i think about it as like uh you're like a chef in a restaurant and then you're creating this you're just spinning off something that's your food yeah exactly but it's you it's like you're putting yourself in the thing yeah artwork whatever it is so how do you develop that thick skin like how you clearly had it somewhat intrinsically probably if you were able to do that at 24 but like to listeners even myself trying to embrace and become a feedback magnet how do you actually do that do you have to remove yourself from it like what's the most people would say find a way to remove the ego and remove yourself but that's a very difficult piece of counsel especially for people who take pride in their work yeah it usually comes from a really good place and not tactical it's not tactical because it's like okay what is the ego like honestly what is that we're going to get into a very meta discussion what is selfish yeah exactly yeah who am i yeah [Laughter] but i have a pretty tactical approach which is if the the fear of feedback is around the optics of failing however you define failing failing to be perfect failing to be wildly successful failing to do what everyone needs at all times failing to delight you know whatever that is i just redefine failure fail so go farther up funnel of the psychology i redefine failures first attempt in learning like of course when there are new elements and the reality is there are always new elements there is no way the playbook of yesterday works for this there's no way what i did with 30 different humans in a different country is going to be exactly the approach for a different country and 30 additionally unique variables and so failure's first attempt in learning failure is not um you know preventing or failure is not having issues failure is not someone being disappointed that's not failure failures just fail fail first attempt in learning and then this definition then of what is my role my role as a server go back to the chef example the restaurant example when i was a hooters girl is for them to have food they love an experience they like so they spend the most and tip me the most that's it like my proximity to feedback the feedback loop in that business is it's not even a line the dots are like laying on top of each other you cannot escape people's reaction to what you in the business have prepared this amazing training ground for digesting feedback because they're like i hate this or it's not what i wanted and you literally have to fix it you can't be like oh that makes me scared i'm going to go to the bathroom like you got to fix the wings and and make it not about you i remember so many times we had two wing sauces mild and three mile they sound a lot alike in a loud restaurant and so sometimes three mile would get delivered which is blazing effing hot and when they ordered mild and they would take a bite and it was an unfortunate incident and i'd have to say i'm so you know could have been them could have been me but say i'm so sorry that is not what you wanted or needed i will get back on it right away right it's about them and i don't beat myself up that i made a mistake because what's really important is just fixing it and then having a great experience and then oh by the way here's some extra ranch and celery you're going to need it after accidentally and making it better even better because there was a mistake so this idea of reframing reframing failure um has been empowering to me going back to that hooters sit in the restroom listen to what people say and then iterate on their feedback example failure would have been letting the experience be suboptimal failure would have been not correcting the things in their mind it's in their mind no matter what don't i want to know it and then i have the choice to do something about it or maybe it's not something i change but i can explain a bit later of why things are the way that they are it's literally why i implemented the mmdd log made my day difficult log in every restaurant i've ever opened this was guidance from like a 1980s restaurant consultant where he'd say do an mmdd log let the staff tell you what makes their day difficult find the patterns fix it so literally every opening i had a clipboard at the back door before you left you had to write the one thing that made your day the most difficult sometimes the answer was me luckily we had a culture where obviously people felt comfortable saying cat's confusing us with these instructions but then i could find the patterns come back the next day fix the top few things or if i wasn't going to fix it say hey this is making everyone's day difficult here's why we can't fix it right now so i see you i hear you let's try to smooth it out around the edges but it's i actually can't change so don't spend your energy or i disagree maybe something bigger at the corporate level um i disagree that this should change here's why i've clearly done a bad job of explaining the benefits so i have used a literal version of the mmd d-log for 20 years in business it's now a slack channel and all the companies i run and advise or an email if the culture isn't comfortable with an open slack channel i've used apps where you upvote and downvote what made people's day difficult the less change the more often you need to ask or the less change the less often you need to ask the more change the more often you need to ask so if there's a lot of [ __ ] going on it's made my day difficult every day and every day there's change if it's you know a little more spread out you can do it once a week once a month but this literally is soliciting feedback and building uh feedback magnets in the organization i do it in departments because not everyone needs to know about everyone's feedback but then department leaders need to talk and if there's something that is consistent across the company it rises to the level of the executive team it's also a startup cool yeah like i'm i'm listening to you and i'm like okay cat like how do i invest you know like how do you productize this like i don't know if it's a slack bot or an email with like a dashboard the branding would be perfect um i see it now i love it i've literally implemented this for decades it could literally be called like feedback magnet wait it's just a thing that like gets dropped into 20 places in the organization feedback feedback yeah i think that's a cool idea idea it might be maybe not the most game-changing practice in a company but in the top three well i mean i experienced it firsthand in the context of my own career where like i would get to a year-end review like we had a two review cycle was our standard which may be a standard incorporated like you have a midi review in the year end and there would literally be things that would come up in my year interview that i had no idea i was doing wrong and i would show up and be like how how did i not know that that was an issue how did i know my hair was so good well i knew that no but seriously like that is crazy and that is a lot of gdp and growth for that company left on the table when that happened so feedback or whatever we end up calling it um maybe it's i i there's like a very simple way to implement it too it's just constant feedback like you have an interaction with someone they should be able to rate that interaction it's kind of there was a there was a black mirror episode did you ever watch that show oh yeah like black mirror where like you would rate your interaction with someone like i would see you and it was augmented reality and then i'd be like oh five stars for cat like two stars for greg didn't really like that here's why whatever and during the course of the day you'd have like a build up of different interactions different things that would kind of rate your experience but that could be in a corporate setting like if i have a meeting with someone and i feel like they didn't come in as prepared as they should have been or they didn't deliver the insights in a you know short form enough to be able to iterate on that and then at the end of the day get a reporter end of a week of things i can be working on and thinking about super cool one of the things i noticed as i've pushed this feedback practice he's like this is happening as i push this feedback in practice two leaders who were then getting it that weren't me right it's one thing if i'm comfortable with it i've redefined failure i'm a feedback magnet i'm doing it that's great but when i start to push it to other managers who then are implementing it there's still a lot of psychology and emotions to the whole point of where we've gone with this discussion underneath how to take it and so if you put in this feedback bot magnet some mmdd log made my day difficult log there must be an accompanying alignment around anyone who is in charge of receiving and acting on the feedback around the attitude the culture the removal of ego to the extent that it's unproductive you do have to have that as the side dish to this thing in a company in order for the people who are being asked to give feedback to do so candidly and frequently otherwise we all know how it plays out right someone gets it and is like that's [ __ ] or someone gets it and they're like oh that's me i i don't know how to process it or deal with it or these people suck they don't know what they're talking about right you have those managers as well who don't respect the people giving the feedback and discount it and so this can be quite revealing across the organization of the need to create feedback magnets of the need to have discussions and coaching around feedback culture and can why don't we want to know don't we want to act on it if we don't our competition will if we don't someone else will i think the really cool thing about it too is that it creates a very real stake in the ground that you can then track against so like if i know from the first month here are the five things that consistently come up about me as a manager as a peer and now this is what i'm going to get reviewed against or compt against is going to be my ability to take that stake in the ground and improve it and so if i was getting rated as a three on communication you know efficiency or something i need to make that to a four and so i'm just going to be thinking about that constantly because i know that at the end of the year or at the mid-year whatever my bonus or my review comp is going to be based on my ability to actually improve those like five things that have consistently come up and so it's kind of cool to think about how then it plays into the ability of orcs to actually action on um you know performance reviews and promotions and bonuses and all of those things to make them more i just always hated the arbitrary aspect of that pay it's like oh did my boss like me and was i nice to them and did i do stuff for them versus did i actually make real progress and get better at the things i was supposed to be getting better at so it's kind of cool it could be an interesting component and to your point of patterns over time so you know my husband and i do these monthly check-ins that many people have heard yes so it is feedback and so since the month we met we decided that we wanted to be as good for each other at home as we are in business and i've never felt that way in previous relationships i mean i wanted the relationship to be good but i never thought i want to be an amazing partner but i did when i met him and he did as well and so we're like all right if we care and if we want that and we want to be proactive about it where can we take inspiration for how to do that and of course the answer was business and our our leadership roles and so we scheduled a monthly check-in we asked the same questions every month what's been the best part of the last 30 days what's been the worst part of the last 30 days tell me one thing i can do differently to be a better partner for you and that is either a stop a start or continue what has worried you the most in the last 30 days what has given you the most pride and what are you most grateful for every 30 days since we have met we have asked and answered those questions to each other sometimes it only takes 15 minutes max other times it creates a deeper discussion we don't hold off real-time feedback for that place but that place that space is held for the purpose of feedback on anything touching the relationship which could be work and this check-in format i've used in business for over a decade as well so sometimes since it's about work the thing that has worried them the most that affects them at work is something at home so it's not a heart to your point of it's not a hard line and there's not a big wall there there are things that affect who you are in this piece of your world that come from other pieces and there should be permission to talk about that but it's still primarily focused on the area and those monthly check-ins which are not okrs they're not checking in on kpis you're not talking about deliverables and performance it's just those questions has been [Music] i mean i don't know our relationship without it but i can tell you the people who've adopted their own version of it after hearing about it have said this has changed my marriage or this has changed my direct report relationship with my executives there's something about that going in tapping into just where you are and that question tell me one thing i can do differently to be a better partner for you is very interesting to see the patterns over time this is another startup idea by the way that there's gonna be too many coming out of this episode but like that should be in an app or some easy format where like i would love to do that with my wife i think that's super interesting and could make it really easy six moleskins exactly it's a really cool like if i'm just on the go and i want to like put plug something in or i'm thinking about it it's kind of a cool idea to just have like a super simple whatever app interface where you could check in like we have all of this for when you first start dating hinge exists there's all the algorithm and you're connecting and it's like trying to match you at the outset but then there's nothing really as far as i know that exists for like later on now you're in a relationship or you're married and you're trying to track these things and track the progress of your relationship you want to hopefully have a curve where you're growing over time in your proximity and in you know the depth of your relationship and and you change and so there's different things that change about your life you have a kid you don't have a kid you're like getting old you're kidding me all these different phases and so the ability to like track it over time look at the data over time for these people that are more data oriented and not like you know kpis and all this and that but like find patterns just it kind of provides like a journaling plus real feedback element to it that's kind of cool to pull together it's it is interesting to see when you talk about like one of the questions which can be the most emotional which is what's worried you the most in the last 30 days um to see how that evolves over time and even with my direct reports executives right sometimes it's the health of a parent money um or something directly in the business like my team is just not jealous it's very interesting to your point of being able to look back and go look how far you've come remember when that was the thing that was wearing you the most and remember when that was the thing that was the worst three months in a row look how so yeah that's amazing we'll add it to the list i need to add i know we're starting to get close to the to the end of our time together i need to ask you a question that relates sort of broadly to your career and experiences but one of the things i've admired about you as a friend and as a mentor person i look up to is you're extremely open to new ideas experiences people cultures you've shown it with your going down the rabbit hole in red pill on web three and how deep into that world you've gotten and how you've embraced our cartoons half of the time yeah but it's a it's a um it's a personality trait you clearly have and that you've embraced and i read an amazing story about you from early in your career i think of an experience you had in the middle east and it's a perfect example of this trait that you have and i think a lot of people will benefit from hearing it so i would love for you to just tell this story yeah i was uh traveling in egypt visiting my franchisees and um this was with cinnabon and the gulf is the largest market outside the u.s for cinnabon there's so much at the time uh 31. okay new president of cinnabon taking over the global business and i had for the past two years i had also spent some time in in turkey and fell in love with theodon the call to prayer i mean when the loudspeakers would blast it was it touched my soul it was like meditative and so much so that i had an app on my phone with the addon with a call to prayer from every major country that that has it so there's different tones and different speeds and it's really cool anyone can like look it up in the app store just look up a don or called a prayer and a bunch of them will come up and um and i really have no religion to speak of personally and i just thought it was beautiful and so i had this on my phone i'm in egypt we're driving through and then call to prayer comes on we pull over to people you know need to go pray and um and this happened a couple times but throughout that my franchisee that was in the car when it came on i just said this is so beautiful can we roll down the windows you know i really wanted to hear it the music was on can we turn down the music so i can hear it and he was blown away he was blown away that an american a non-muslim like all the things you can imagine that this was a narrative violation in this moment and he had he got teary and it started this whole different conversation together about my appreciation for it i showed him my app he didn't even know there was an app like with all of these countries and he thought that was really cool and we were already totally vibing it was he's just super cool guy but it took our relationship to a very different level quickly and he saw me as a i don't know a family member a more connected human because i just said something that clearly articulated i thought something about his culture was beautiful and on its face like i don't know what they're saying i mean i know a bit more now but at the time i'm like i literally have no idea what there's like i just think it's so beautiful and it created this moment that accelerated trust and a common bond that led to better business you know and it just went on i'm still dear friends with the franchisees while all over the world but certainly in this region today i i believe that that moment did something with our relationship where i became more like family than this very hospitable culture would have already treated me um that lasted throughout my my term as you know president of the brand and even into being president of many brands with the parent company and it made it easier for me to call and say hey do you want to be a franchisee of jamba juice and hey i mean it led to big business and big growth over time around the world and similar things happened but that was a really unique one and you didn't go into it what i think is so amazing about the story is that that wasn't why you did it you didn't say you weren't like oh this could be a big business moment for me let me like kind of play my way it was just you were that was who you were i'm not that strategic but it's sort of i mean there's an amazing lesson in there just like you said narrative violation like be a narrative violation just embrace different cultures different people different ideas talk to the random person on the street that you come across you end up coming up with random startup ideas you build these relationships that you never know how they extend you never know where those trees kind of lead you in those branches unless you open yourself to it i love i used to call myself a walking conflict of interest not because i was but because i knew that's how some saw me i was a hooters girl and i was advocating for women's rights i was running cinnabon and investing in the future of health and wellness and and it's not that i was atoning for my sins you know i'm the same person who saw purpose and mission in these things as i'm on my own personal journey and in fact that makes me more of a bridge person because i'm not preaching to the converted i'm someone with a hand in one world a hand in another authentically not trying to have no opinion or no point of view or being neutral but literally find beauty here and find beauty here and live in both worlds where many people don't it's one of the things i'm loving about web3 and nfts like this you know anonymity and um just leaning into web 3 and then people coming together irl and you put some of these groups together and every one of them would acknowledge we might not have ever met we may not have otherwise been in other circles it looks like a narrative violation but it's actually not it's actually it is the way i think it's the best i also like how i like how you use the word authenticity because it reminds me of because you know i know you were not strategic but i think from a marketing perspective like being authentic obviously is such a great way to grow your brand yeah you're seeing this with web3 like nft communities that are taking off but it reminds me of the story of like in quebec people don't drink coca-cola they drink pepsi and the reason why they drink pepsi is because when coca-cola and pets when coca-cola came to quebec they basically used the same ads that they use for the rest of canada and they're just like okay there's these french people who live here we're just gonna translate it into french like literally the worst country to make that decision the worst country yeah and it was completely like people were like you know uh absolutely not and then pepsi came and they crafted a message that was so authentic to that group of people and they kind of went you know they went anti-coke in a lot of ways they just basically learned from their mistakes and to this day pepsi is everywhere i have a funny story so i uh brought the first hooters uh to quebec gatineau quebec and we had not thoughtfully evolved the business were open to it but other than what was required by law which was the menu being in french and english there wasn't really any other overture to say we are here for you and there are certain places certain cities countries states boston is another one as a city in the u.s where if you aren't like of the people by the people from the people for the people one of the worst cities for chains as a result and if you don't figure out how to really grow from within you are doomed and i remember it wasn't until the last day i was there for almost 30 days that the team warmed up it was brutal i mean it was the toughest time in building trust in relationships i had in any country anywhere in the world out of 80 countries because of this one it was a pattern of american brands entering the space without the respect and partnership so there was just this wall up and it took us while we're trying to train and deliver and get our poutine right and all of the other things on the menu and trying to get my american trainers to not you know react and poke fun but to just be curious like be curious and help make it happen it was so high friction and at the end there were tears and hugs and appreciation but it wasn't as natural as that you know egypt story it was uh it was there was a lot more you don't want to be here and we don't want you here and it's you in our land as opposed to our thing that we're building together and about a week into the training i scrapped it all i scrapped the menu scrapped the recipes had a like a do-over meeting with the team where all we did was listen and learn in french listen to people talking about their restaurants that are their favorite how they think this type of food has a place in their world i mean i should have done that day one but i'm proud that i had the courage to still do it day eight quebec is the only place in the world where starbucks isn't called starbucks and kfc is now called kfc i believe it it's called you know kfc is called pfk pule-free kentucky which is hilarious yep um starbucks is called le cafe starbucks and they they do you know i think it's a lesson learned right for these brands um that's right to make people feel at home and i think you know there's that saying uh if you can make it in new york you can make it anywhere but if you're a marketing person if you can make it in quebec you can make it anywhere for sure because and that that's what i think i learned from that experience of is if you're going to be a community builder you do have to uh you have to not talk and listen i guess it's the big sort of uh lesson there and then once you've listened you really understand the people then you can understand what are the nuances that they have that i can build product around so that i can serve them i mean literally a listening leader is a learning leader and a learning leader is a lasting leader and you're never done that's good this interesting listening leader is a learning leader learning leader is a lasting leader boom that's good that's a good get that tattooed on my chest yeah i think that's a good place to uh i think that's a good place to wrap up i know we got to get you out to whatever your next event is as well so thank you so much for coming in and joining us yeah awesome so much fun i like constantly learn so much from just being around you so i feel privileged that we get to do this somehow for a living circle is awesome it's the future and we love it so thank you so much kat you're the best great thank you so we covered a whole hell of a lot that episode so i don't know how you're going to do this but what was your one big takeaway i think my biggest takeaway is how important it is for all of us startup founders startup employees employees creators to find a coach and use a coach to become uh just the best version of yourself and i know that's easy to say and it's hard to find a coach and they're expensive but i think that um you know even if it's you know once a month once every two months once every three months or even using some of those automated solutions that cat was talking about um i think uh i think it's pretty crucial to go just go one layer deeper for me like how can someone go find a coach like what what what's the step to take for someone that actually wants to go do that an action on it is it like google search are you talking to people you tweet it out like how do you actually go find a coach i mean i think i think you know first is you just ask around ask friends join discords come into our discord and just ask and maybe we can provide some recommendations the hardest part about finding a coach and cat you know can't kind of mention it is finding someone you can trust so i think it's like a very personal decision also like what you know what might what might be a great coach for myself might not be a good coach for you because you just might not just connect with that person so i think it's going on you know step one going on discord going on twitter asking around step two going on google setting up like there's there's a bunch of marketplaces that you can kind of like go and uh have video chats with some of these people just to get a sense of it and then feel it out and set up a budget for it and this is like your invest in yourself budget um maybe it's a couple hundred bucks a month maybe it's a couple hundred bucks every three months whatever you can afford and and use that to you know work on one or two three or three things that are affecting your professional life that even might stem from your personal life super super interesting something for me to think about personally too because i've never had a coach yeah in this context so yeah definitely something for me to reflect on more um time for a coach yeah i loved all the startup ideas and we had so many in that episode which was crazy to go through but like the whole concept of taking something that the big companies have and have built finding the atomic unit of that and delivering it to a smaller group of niche down smaller community is such a cool concept to me like whether it's for transportation with the uber drivers that i talked about um you know whether it's the coaching solution that we talked about and and applying it here um and then the feedback feedback and dating or the feedback and relationships uh app ideas were really really cool so i'm i'm excited there's like a lot out of there that i want to jump into the community want to get in there and talk about more let's talk about all these startup ideas let's talk about coaches see if we can help some people get more of that coaching and maybe some peer-to-peer coaching couldn't even happen as a result of it so we want to jump in there let's get into the community

another idea that i've been um growing and hopefully i'll find some founder that's tackling this and wants help but is the idea of us you know as consumers filling out a profile for ourselves all of our likes and dislikes and everything and proactively opting to share that with every brand and restaurant and hotel and airline that we ever come in contact with because everyone in the hospitality sector wants to know more about us and there's a lot of information that we want everyone to know about us or at least like the subset of brands and experiences that we patronize as consumers and so why isn't there like a a brand for that you know where you fill out your preferences you know i don't like shampoo bottles in my hotel room so i don't want to waste plastic every time i stay in a hotel put that in there and then boom every time i'm at any participating hotel they have my profile they don't waste the money on the shampoo i'm not pissed about it and everyone wins this is so so okay so well for like i might want to go do this this is brilliant so basically like you have a central hub whatever call it uh belsky yeah and um you log in and it collects up front a bunch of information about you on all of your different preferences food hospitality all of these different things and then hospitality industry whatever it is travel industry hotels restaurants everything start in a given city they all pay to then access this hub it's all it's an api thing you know we would make an api that interacts with all their databases for all their customers right and they just do and it's hugely valuable for them because then the first time i go to joe's bar and grill on the corner they create the best experience for me they already know exactly the five things that i'm gonna want they know the exact drink i always have a woodford on the rocks when i come in they already have it ready for me it's like that amazing restaurant experience you get when you've been somewhere a hundred times and they know you're the usual and they give you the thing and they know exactly what you like and they know it's your birthday and they know you know to give you a rose because it's your wife's you know anniversary that week like they do all that and isn't it funny that like every brand out there is trying to suck data out of us that we don't necessarily want to have shared and i'm suggesting like let's make a company that gets all the data we do want shared

greg we are back we are back 2022 uh [ __ ] man a lot uh crazy break i feel like um normally i try to take the like holidays as a time to kind of like catch up and regroup on things and um i felt like with covet it was like 2x the ability to do that because i was able to just get out of a bunch of stuff that i didn't really want to do so it was good i feel like i got a lot done over the break it's good to see you man if we haven't really chatted so i mean we've dm'd a little bit so and and we talked we talked about some articles we we had enough of each other after that like week in miami right like it was kind of we kind of needed like a little break um you know i felt like we got in real you know we spent a lot of time together so it was good to have a little break it's like distance makes the heart grow fonder right all right yeah but i'm ready let's let's get everybody back into it yeah and you know like we have a very cool set of things to talk about um today which i'm personally really excited about we um you know we've both been talking over the last few days about like what does 2022 look like and what are our personal goals like we talked about late checkout talked about some of my personal business stuff what we were focusing on and a lot of it always honed around um you know like predictions for the future what does the future look like and how we can actually build into that future i always think um like this concept and this framework you and i have talked about of like variant perception like you have to have a variant perception of what the future looks like i.e like a contrarian or different perspective um and then go build into that and then you're paid when you're proven correct about what that variant perception is of the future and so you and i have jammed a lot on that like what are our contrarian views of what the future looks like that not a lot of people understand or believe and how do you go build into that um and that's kind of a good frame up for what we want to actually get to dive into today so okay so what do you what's on your mind 2022 predictions where are we going where's the world headed i feel like the common wisdom today says that the world is never going to be as in person as it was pre-covered um and my like one of my more contrarian views is that i think a lot of things are going to go back to normal like i actually i might be totally wrong in this but i think that a lot of tech jobs are going to go back to being in person versus this like you know assumption that everything is going to be a remote forever and i think i saw some chart on like hacker news or something that like 80 90 of job openings for developers were now remote um i just think it's going to swing back in some direction i think people are going to find it hard to manage and build culture and scale culture in a remote context and i i honestly i think i'm like a total uh unicorn in thinking this right now because um everyone's gonna yell at me and say that i'm an idiot for for making that statement but i still just think it's really hard to like manage time and and really build and scale culture in a remote context i mean so i've been working remote since 2014 which is a really long time and even when i had a company in san francisco and our team was in san francisco i was like we're working remote i think people like me who have seen like the unlock of productivity and remote it's gonna in tech it's gonna be hard for us to go back i think what you're gonna see is a ton of like like um summits like late checkout we're remote company there's 50 team members like how do we do a summit every month three months whatever in different cool places that we can come together again facetime i think that's where i think there's a ton of opportunity to build companies around that yeah um i like that i think that's like a cool infrastructure thing too of like bridging the gap in between the two and how do you go build a business that allows people to you know basically like culture as a service right like you know you need to have culture it's so important for growing businesses can you create a culture as a service business and it sort of relates in to some of the deeper stuff i wanted to get into too with our guests today um just around like polygamous careers as he called it so scott bilsky is our guest today um amazing tech entrepreneur writer etc um wrote over the weekend this epic piece on um predictions right like it was 10 predictions for the near future of tech was what i think it was called and i saw it and i immediately sent it to you and was like holy [ __ ] we got to get scott on we've been wanting to have mine for a while but with kovid really hard to do in person right now and getting a video team that doesn't have covid right now is like next to impossible uh we have a friend uh who was hosting a new year's party and he was like i can't get vendors that don't have kovitz so i think we were stuck in that but i was like dude holy [ __ ] we gotta get scott on to go through these things because a few of them really spoke to me a few of them i totally disagree with um and i think we can have a really cool conversation with him just like jamming on a bunch of these predictions and the businesses that can be built around these ideas yeah and i think uh right before this we actually had a community call uh in our discord and just got the feedback from people from the room where it happens discord and and just to get us into like what do you think do you agree do you disagree and it's really interesting like i you know scott is i have the most amount of respect for scott he's he invested in my last company islands um you know everything he says i think is like gold but at the same time it's so interesting that we disagree on some stuff you disagree on some stuff and our community disagrees on stuff it just goes to show you that like not everything is a gold i should say not 100 is gold um just because you know and we were talking about this earlier like aaron aaron levy and uh brian chesky were are kind of talking about how web 3 is you know basically a sham that's basically what they're what they're saying just because these leaders or titans of industry are saying you know this is where the world's gonna go doesn't mean it's the gospel so take everything with a grain of salt i agree i want to get i actually want to talk to scott about that too because i think he'll have a great take on it so let's bring him in um and uh and just dive in on this stuff cool let's do it captrace is the financing solution for fast-growing startups it lets companies access their revenue today so that they can reinvest in their business

commonstock.com you won't regret it there he is the man the myth the legend what's up guys how you doing thank you thank you so much for joining us it is our is my pleasure well it's funny i was saying to greg before you jumped on here that like basically we had been we had you like on our tier one list i was like we have to get scott to come on an episode of the show but with kovid right now it's basically impossible to do anything in person you know we've been filming most of these things in person but like you know let alone us all sitting in a room together and not getting covered but like go find a video crew that doesn't have covert right now it's basically impossible which means we'll probably all be back together again soon right last time sahil and i were together recording i got coveted [Laughter] i didn't by the way we sat together for like eight episodes and i was somehow resilient and came through it so but with a pregnant wife at home me doing things that expose me is like a non-starter so we're ultimately just trying to avoid it but um thank you so much for joining i mean the um it felt like a perfect opportunity to bring you on because i'm sitting around this weekend i think it was like on fridays like new year's day or new year's eve rather and um i see this thing pop up and a bunch of people are sending it to me being like oh [ __ ] have you seen this piece that scott wrote and i pull it open i'm reading through it and i text it to greg like i think i was one thing into it i texted to greg and i just said like dude we have to get scott to come on because this is epic um and so now here we are like a few days later this is the world of the internet so a few days later we slid in your dms and here we are filming an episode so i'm super stoked well it is a pleasure i mean greg and i go way back we've had quite a few gems over the last 10 years on various topics um and yeah i mean this is like my own little mental exercise i try to capture some things that are interesting to me over the course of a year and then i try to force myself uh under pressure to like synthesize cut down and uh you know and and and declare like which ones i think you know are really relevant you know and can you in your future and these are the ones that made the cut so excited to discuss can you actually talk just for one minute about that process because i think a lot of people find it interesting like so during the course of the year do you like have a document like a living document where you're jotting things down that you're noticing and then you try to synthesize it or like what's your actual process around formulating these yeah i mean listen i'm a compulsive capturer um you know both of the books that i published were like seven years of scribbled notes and then one year of synthesis and organization um my feeling is that you know ideas are all over the place but if you apply like a really you know concentrated form of execution and organization around them you can like 10x the outcome of them and so i feel like i try to treat my writing the same way so in this case i have a notion doc called annual photo forecasts and i just think about you know things that i feel will be extraordinarily relevant over the next three to five years whenever i come across them and then you know i try to have some like culling periods throughout the year and then i try to you know take the last few weeks just to synthesize because to me it's you know it's casting the line for a lot of interesting you know founders that are exploring these ideas it's um it's also sending some signal to my own teams you know my day job as an operator building products for creative people about things that are interesting and it also just it's mental exercise totally do you pressure test them with people along the way like do you call smart people you know and tell them to tell you you're an idiot or what are you missing or i do um my dms are full of debates with a number of people about a number of things number one number two i do send like a draft out to a few friends usually just to get um their take on like what they think i should cut so usually it's like if you had to cut two of them which would you cut so actually the 10 that i came out with i had around 16 or 18 of them before and then i just kind of cut them down that way and then um and then you know twitter is great for just like sharing things in real time throughout the year and if everyone you know dunks on it that usually means it's actually super interesting by the way i know that was what i was gonna say the ones that like everyone agrees with aren't that interesting no right it's the stuff that people are really uh thrown off by because that's where the opportunity lies right is where we are uncomfortable absolutely we were just talking about uh i don't know if you saw last night aaron aaron levy and brian chesky's sort of web three yeah yeah i heard i have a few dm's going right now so i i'm i'm aware of his views and you know and i think he's he has a lot of great points and he's really smart like these are the people that i think bring us up to another level you know when we're trying to reconcile some new technology and the implications of it so what do you yeah i mean i don't know how to process it because i look at those guys as sort of inspiration you know inspirational um you know they help build the what you know current web 2 infrastructure and build really big businesses and then i look at it and i see them just completely dunking on like um you know where i'm spending all pretty much all my time so yeah i'm curious you know how would how do you think about that and what sort of advice do you give to people who who see that and and don't know how to digest it well i mean it's one of those moments right now in technology where everyone is both right and wrong right now right i mean whoever thinks that this is going to reinvent the world and solve every problem as we know it is probably wrong and those who feel like it's nothing are certainly wrong as well i i always find it fascinating when a technology forces on us a compromise of something that we typically thought was extremely important a great example happened in my industry where five to seven years ago when adobe about my company behance actually back in 2012 the idea of a creative tool for professionals on the web was insane like no one would ever trade performance and precision for ease of access and collaboration you know when we went to creatives and asked them like would you want a web-based application for image editing or screen design or whatever it was like laughable it's like are you kidding me i'm not gonna bring my performance down to like whatever my web connection is right and yet there were some teams out there like my friend dylan and others who recognized that people are willing to trade performance and precision for ease of collaboration and it was like this insight into this next you know generation or psychographic of like i want everything to be with other people like i i grew up in the age of google docs and even if i have a little more kind of latency issue i'd rather have that than not be able to work with other people in a truly multiplayer way and that to me has redefined the web as we know it um for for my industry and now we have photoshop on the web and illustrator on the web you know that's the direction that things are going so here we are in this whole web 3 debate one of aaron aaron's biggest points is that um it's slow you know it's like why would you build a company with slower process why would you serve customers with more onboarding issues and more friction like it defies everything we know about modern software everything succeeds based on speed internally and for customers and now web 3 is like throwing 30 wrenches into the system and so he's right like speed is critical and speed will be required for things to succeed however what is the compromise that we're all maybe willing to make for speed i think one of those compromises might be autonomy you know might be control might be privacy might be be the sense of ownership you know the desire to be incentivized for everything we participate in like some of those desires that our very innate consumer desires are legitimate and may in fact you know have us trade a little bit for speed and um you know and then of course speed will come in later generations of attack i think a piece of what you're getting at is something i've mused on in various ways in the past which is just that like the future of tech allows individuals to make decisions on those trade-offs being versus being forced into them like historically you were kind of forced into whatever the trade-off was that the biggest company decided for like privacy versus functionality as an example like you just were going to give up your privacy in order to have the high functionality of facebook or whatever these consolidated platforms are now now in the web 3 world part of what makes me optimistic is that individuals will actually get to choose with their feet around where they want to be on these different spectrums and so like i think of it even in the most primitive context around like centralization and then like speed and functionality when you go from like say bitcoin ethereum solana there's clearly difference in the like actual decentralized nature of these and you get a trade-off in terms of the speed like solana versus ethereum and the trade-off there that exists around speed pricing et cetera the ability to batch transactions etc um so part of what i think is interesting in all of this is like that idea of individuals actually being able to go and make those decisions on the trade-offs i think that's right and i think that um you know in many cases centralized services will win or hybrid you know decentralized by ethos but centralized to some extent by like certain aspects of the user experience you know i think are you maybe going to ultimately win but i love your point i mean i the fact that we're no longer forced to do anything you know is an incredible feat in and of itself and you know whenever there's competition it always rises you know the customer experience and the options that we all have which is a good thing ultimately yeah and you figure out what people actually care about right like everyone says they care about privacy one of my like general hot takes is that people don't actually care that much about privacy or like the average person doesn't really care that much about privacy and won't be willing to actually pay for it with worse functionality and so i think you finally learn what's that especially in the next generation yeah no totally yeah yeah you've gotten used to it right like people are still posting their entire lives on tiktok which is like owned by the chinese government so um anyway why don't we dive into some of these um greg what do you think let's do it um [ __ ] where do we start it's so there's so many good ones in here let's start at the top actually um because i thought the first one was like really ripe for some interesting things so recommendations kill favorites um can you talk a little bit about this one to start us off scott yeah well i'll be like provocative just to try to make this interesting for all of us but what what if we're all living in our own prisons so to speak you know everything that we happen to be exposed to throughout childhood based on our location cultural you know uh the the music tastes of our parents the restaurants we happened to learn about when we were you know living in our city and traveling like all of these things were exposed to by circumstance we cherry pick the ones that we like and then those become our favorites and those become our go-to's and we end up in some ways living the life where we're like more and more constrained to those things because time is limited and you want to make sure you have a good meal at night you want to make sure that your hour of listening to music is good music and so you just go back to music you've always listened to and so i've always been you know worried that i'm being like increasingly confined to some degree and i used to insanely uh organize my playlists on you know my music playlists and stuff and my dinner party playlist was my go-to playlist for so many years and so many years and then over the last year or so you know spotify launched their enhance function so any three or four songs you put in a playlist you can push enhance and have it a refreshed ai driven playlist based on that you know short short set of songs and my running list became that list and i was like oh my gosh new music every single day when i run and suddenly i realize that my playlists are like these old you know dusty limiting things that i've been a prisoner to to some degree and um and maybe recommendations have reached that singularity moment at least they have for me and my musical taste where i trust the ai more than my own kind of go-to's you know my own like sort of you know circumstantial run-ins with random songs from shazam or whatever and so you know that for music that for travel that for restaurants that for whatever like maybe we're all going to vastly increase the surface area of our exposure to stuff we like and in some ways like abandon the concept of favorites all together i have okay so my reaction to that is and you know i worked at stumbleupon which is like og spotify recommendation so i'm a huge believer in this um finally this is like hitting mainstream what scares me about it is or actually it's a question to you like do you think that we lose like in a world where you know ai is giving us all our recommendations do we lose like let's say i create a playlist for you for you know scott like that emotional connection that i you know oh like yeah maybe greg doesn't get me as well as you know an algorithm that has been learning you know trained to learn about me for 10 years but um the fact that he actually created this and thought about it even the fact that i don't like the rolling stones and it's literally my most hated band like do you feel like we'll lose that that's a good question you know i think that i think that it will i think these i think the list that you're describing you might make for me will never be as good um now i do think we'll still have spawns in 80. you know i think that spotify probably knows you and i are connected and you know might say hey you know let's algorithmically test greg's favorite three songs with scott and see if he you know replays them likes them or ignores them or skips them and you know and so i feel like i mean the answer is of course yes and yes right like i mean we should still we will still be exposed to music in totally random ways i guess this is more about our human tendency to always collect favorites and go back to the stuff we know versus surrendering ourselves to like the ai algorithms that we don't know because they're just so reliable and they push us to actually open our boundaries you know more so than our own go-to's it's also interestingly self-limiting from a happiness perspective so i have this like utilitarian view on this which is somewhat informed by like my childhood radio nostalgia where me playing spotify my car i have my playlist i have my like 50 songs i like they're probably embarrassing to a lot of people you know i still like the goo-goo dolls i still like semi-charmed life if you don't bop to semi-charm life and you don't like sing that out loud i don't trust you um but i still have all of those things but there's something different about when you turn on the radio and the song you love just comes on without you pressing the button it's like a totally different level of happiness and part of me thinks that there's actually like a increase in overall societal happiness from having things that we love surface to us without us actually doing it um and this is like an unlock for that if you actually have ai that suddenly is able to maybe not suddenly slowly then all at once um able to surface things that you're like holy [ __ ] i loved that and it was totally new to me and it brought up this nostalgia this different feeling versus me going and picking the song that's actually like a net happiness driver societally so i like where you're going i mean you just made me realize that the only company that would probably let put a patch on my arm to like determine and detect my pheromones and my like moods and my temperature and body and everything else would probably be spotify because you know i'm i am totally fine with music being like as you said like perfectly teed up for me based on like all of these signals about me that i don't even realize and if i'm suddenly sad and then boom that like perfect song from like you know the 80s that always got me pumped up when i didn't want to go to school if that came on like that would be pretty amazing so that's epic that's actually like a totally epic idea um that i've never really everyone always talked about like um you know when i when we were kids actually those mood rings you'd have those rings that would like claim they change colors for your different moves you guys just like this crazy idea whoop we should get the link band yeah yeah spotify into a partnership no i like that all right writing that down yeah well i wonder yet i mean it's it seems like a no-brainer to do something like that right because music is like i mean historically even if you just look at human society music has always been a common thread of things that brought people together things that drove different you know relationships religious spiritual whatever it was unlocks i mean even if you think about people with spiritual wellness meditation like all of the like calm and you know headspace and all the apps around that like how do you integrate all of this into this like holistic human experience that's driven through sound um kind of brilliant actually i'm a little bit thrown off by this i didn't think we were going to come up with [ __ ] well this kind of goes into one of the uh one of the other predictions i don't know if you want to jump around or not yeah please you know this whole this whole question about us opting into ads and you know i wanted to like kind of strike out the word ads and just call it personalized experiences but i think that you know we we grew up in the age of banner ads and like two teeth whitening ads and weight loss ads and like we see ads as dirty and interruptive and takeovers of web pages and [ __ ] like that we just hate ads right and yet we love it when we walk into a restaurant and they know our name we love it when like uh you know a restaurant ordering up like sweet cream knows that we're a vegetarian and oh just like hides all the menu items with meat like you know we like we like to get personalized experiences in every part of our life people love uh you know that not all people but i know a lot of people who like the instagram ads you know that they get because they're like i actually click on them it's like cool stuff you know that is seems geared towards me and so you know i know we're in this era right now of like the great opt out and as ios you know surfaces ad tracking and kind of makes it harder for brands to give us personalized experiences but i think as we're about to enter a world where we want our music to be served up to us based on our body temperature you know we want our uh we want our it's just me maybe i'm not suggesting that's all of us um we want we want to have um experiences with brands where they know who we are i think we're going to start opting back in and i think especially in the world of ar you know where we have immersive experiences around us we're going to want to be known everywhere we are yeah i think so yeah good yeah no i also think like first of all when i think of my own life like probably like five percent of my wardrobe is from instagram if i actually think about it really like is that high or low i i don't like it's high it's high it's like when i'm when i think of my flip-flops i have some hats like i don't when i'm scrolling through instagram i don't feel like i'm getting targeted you know i feel like that's like the old guard that target like that targeted feel just feels like oh this is interesting you know i talked about stumble upon earlier for those of you who don't know someone pano was this uh this website or toolbar actually that you'd press a button based on your interest that would serve you up websites that were interesting to you and we invented this we didn't want to call them ads we called it paid discovery which you know one in every 10 stumbles would be this you know relevant for you web page and [Music] i think that that's the direction i mean it's it's happened with instagram but i think like you're totally right on this prediction i think it's 100 gonna happen and i think that people like me are just gonna want to opt in to content from brands basically or or influencers or whatever that's the way i see it at least so i get a little scared here um and it ties the first prediction set together to this second one for me and i want you guys to tell me if you if you disagree um what scares me here is like so music tied to your mood and your daily habits and yeah like whether you're tired awake whatever i love that like i think it's human you know happiness utilitarian view is is net positive when you start like now venturing into the world of like consumer brands being able to know how you're feeling and target you at times when like your emotional state is most you know attuned to spending money because you're depressed or whatever it is i start to feel this like little dystopian tickle on the back of my neck that um i don't love like it starts to get black mirrory for me and so what i worry about with this like opt-in ads like super personalized everything is perfect right when you need it um is like okay where does the data sharing um where does all that just like cross that very thin line to being overly intrusive in your life i mean listen i'm scared about the same thing and as i'm sharing ideas and brainstorming with you guys i'm also cognizant of the fact that we're going to have to have an incredible amount of transparency with the user so they understand you know what they're doing you know what they're sharing and why um you know maybe it's like a um maybe it's like a way where you kind of get paid for your willingness to contribute that additional information into these algorithms like um you know conceivably in a in an economic sense more highly efficient ads allow consumer companies to lower prices because they're able to actually drive better margin efficiency or better kind of return on that spend um so i wonder whether they can kind of pass through some of that like you know you actually kind of get paid in a certain sense more directly for your willingness to contribute additional data or opt-in to these things yeah be interesting there's a lot of innovation to be had here like can people be informed why they're seeing or why an experience is a certain way you know when you're looking at an experience you already kind of know what's an ad i mean they have to show that but if you can further understand like what's being personalized for you and where it's coming from you know imagine if it doesn't you know if it's a normal thing for us as consumers to kind of go in and just look at our profile from the standpoint of the of the brand like what are you know or do they see me as an athletic person do they see me as a uh this person or that person and why i mean it's it's it sounds kind of scary and controversial but shouldn't we as consumers kind of know how we're being profiled to some extent and maybe even be able to you know to impact that to some degree that's interesting i wonder whether there's a way to do that in a third party context so if you could like create a tool that basically takes as inputs everything you're being served up and then creates an output of like here's the archetype that you are being um targeted based off of in your in your online persona you know it's um it's somewhat related which is you know another idea that i've been um growing and hopefully i'll find some founder that's tackling this and wants help but is the idea of us you know as consumers filling out a profile for ourselves all of our likes and dislikes and everything and proactively opting to share that with every brand and restaurant and hotel and airline that we ever come in contact with because everyone in the hospitality sector wants to know more about us and there's a lot of information that we want everyone to know about us or at least like the subset of brands and experiences that we patronize as consumers and so why isn't there like a a brand for that you know where you fill out your preferences you know i don't like shampoo bottles in my hotel room so i don't want to waste plastic every time i stay in a hotel put that in there and then boom every time i'm at any participating hotel they have my profile they don't waste the money on the shampoo i'm not pissed about it and everyone wins is safe so so okay so well for like i might want to go do this this is brilliant so basically like you have a central hub whatever call it uh belsky yeah and you log in and it collects up front a bunch of information about you on all of your different preferences food hospitality all of these different things and then hospitality industry whatever it is travel industry hotels restaurants everything start in a given city they all pay to then access this hub it's all it's an api thing you know we would make an api that interacts with all their databases for all their customers right and they just do and then it's hugely valuable for them because then the first time i go to joe's bar and grill on the corner they create the best experience for me they already know exactly the five things that i'm going to want they know the exact drink i always have a woodford on the rocks when i come in they already have it ready for me it's like that amazing restaurant experience you get when you've been somewhere 100 times and they know you're the usual and they give you the thing and they know exactly what you like and they know it's your birthday and they know you know give you a rose because it's your wife's you know anniversary that week like they do all that and isn't it funny that like every brand out there is trying to suck data out of us that we don't necessarily want to have shared and i'm suggesting like let's make a company that gets all the data we do want shared you know let's structure it in such a way it you know gets it from us for free because we want people to know it and then every brand that we patronize you know that's that pings this api like you know gives us a better experience and it's sort of in our control right because we furnish the data ourselves would you would you make this product web 3 or do you think it's more of a web 2 product i mean you know what i that's a great question like i don't know like i i've only built products in the web 2 world so i think about it that way you know my view on my view on the decentralized concept and it goes back to like the early conversation is the trade-offs right and you know if there's an instance where the customer needs or wants you know something like the benefits of the decentralization of the of the product experience or the underlying like you know the data structure whatever the service itself if they're willing to trade you know a lot of the benefits of centralization for that sounds great yeah i think i think some of the benefits just like jamming on it a little bit um some of the benefits of making a web 3 is well firstly it's just you know if you want to you know let's say you earned tokens you'd be able to swap it into ethereum or other you know usd tokens for what so let's say every time you like checked in a like so to speak or you posted a like you got one token of some sort so the more that you contributed to the network and the deeper the the network you gave so you're incentivized to to publish because you're getting um you're getting tokens and maybe those tokens so that's oh sorry you have something you want to say there nope cool so so like number one is like the financialization of it and swapping number two is um the social aspect of it so let's just say um you know a friend of mine actually bought me an xbox for uh for christmas and i started downloading some games and i started like understand you know kind of getting into it i go on to eisenberg you know my like published page and i say like i like halo infinite i like to play with danny tren um et cetera et cetera i earn these tokens and if i have enough xbox tokens or i've enough overwatch the game tokens or enough you know you know halo infinite tokens then i get access to maybe a private community of people with certain exclusive benefits i guess i think about this and just like and maybe i'm just being like naive on it but i think there's like a pretty simple mvp that you can build something around in one city like say we were doing it in new york i would just go you go get 10 000 20 000 users to fill out the info and then you go on the back of that and go to a thousand you know kind of single ch like single um location restaurants hotels whatever that are in the city and you tell them to pay you a hundred dollars a month to have access to this pool of information from these people and then you use it to serve up hey here are these places to the 20 000 people you just signed up and say here are these places that are going to know exactly what you want deliver a great experience and the places are willing to do it because the retention on these users that are going to love their first experience is going to be amazing and they're going to have customers for life or at least longer than they otherwise would because they're going to serve up a great experience but you like what is that i mean at a thousand stores at 100 a month that's a million dollar arr business um right out of the gate um i just like i think you could spin some and you would get smarter over time because you'd be able to as you got more data make the algorithms better and uh provide a better service and you know and eventually you could have some of these restaurants or hotels or others you know they could start building the profiles for you because you know you book at a local hotel or you look at a you know wherever you go or an airbnb and they say hey you know before you come like fill out the survey so we know your preferences and so it's a white label version of the of the questionnaire that you mentioned in the beginning and then at the end it says do you want to only share this with airbnb or do you want to share this with every brand and restaurant and whatever you go to so you can have a personalized experience everywhere like what percentage of people are going to be like yeah you know everywhere and then yeah like you have it for the for the entire yeah of consumers and yeah that becomes your you know you you leave sdk steakhouse in new york and they tell you hey you can get 50 off your next meal if you fill this thing out right and now you have you know as a company you have another you know thousand people a week or something that are filling this thing out for free and the company pays for it exactly like i think it's you know it could be it would be like the one massive consumer data company where everyone's information is in there because they want it to be in there it's stuff you want the world to know about you you know and that's what i find so compelling about it i i actually agree in the sense you know in terms of an mvp like it doesn't need to be web 3. and in fact like 90 of web 3 ideas mvp it in web 2 and just learn yeah and then if you can add a web3 component once you've understand the problem set a lot better i think that makes a lot more sense just because it's harder to build on web3 i'll tell you like somewhat of a tangent because i know we get to jam on this call right yeah yeah please it is is also around i mean listen you know i bet i've had a lot of these web 3 debates with people as well as as you have and i've seen a lot of them transpire and there's a cynical side of me that wonders also if the reason why a lot of things will have to become web 3 is because of the financialization of all of us and in some ways it's a sad statement on humanity but you know do we are we gonna no longer participate in things unless we're compensated you know there was an interesting debate i was having with a few folks over on twenty this weekend about about wikipedia you know um bill gurley mentioned you know to me well you know wikipedia seems to be going pretty well and no one's peed it's not a dao you know and it's probably one of the most you know incredible gems of the world in internet at least right now a couple questions that i pose in response number one is wikipedia all it could be you know is it some ways being held back by the fact that it's like point zero two percent of participants are actually contributing content everyone else is just using it like could it be something that's 10x better if people were incentivized if maybe the best talent in the world were incentivized to engage number one but then number two i was like what if less people actually contribute to it in the future because of the desire to be compensated for everything you know like what is that like this new trend i okay so first of all have you guys been to wikipedia recently like the home page oh my god like how much earlier did i pay money yeah exactly like a third of the website is like give us money and it's it's a nonprofit and i totally get it and but it just feels potentially unsustainable and for for one of the greatest uh contribution like wikipedia could be one of the most important products of humanity if if you think about it the fact that that could potentially break is really scary yeah i mean it like brought the entirety of like human knowledge based on the base of human knowledge online it was like what the research papers did except they did it for the mainstream right like it wasn't yeah it's like a non-profit you know it's it's the closest thing to a dow that we basically have today um in the sense that it's communally governed and and it's owned by no one essentially uh but did you guys ever do as a side note did you guys ever do wiki quests when you were like younger as kids no this was the most fun thing we used to do during like uh during like free periods in middle school or whatever you would start at some page like say you started at space jam and then there would be an end point like you had to get to you know from space jam to pope leo the 10th and you had to just only using link clicking you had to find your way from one to the other and it was such like it was actually a very cool thing because it forced you to like create these mental connections and map out in your mind like okay what's my general path to get from one to the other and it was all like it was speed and then sometimes you do one with number of clicks and so you'd say you have to do it in under 10 clicks um and get from one to the other but it's actually like pretty fun i now i'm on wikipedia right now as we speak and it's making me like the nostalgia is kicking in of wanting to go back and do one it's so funny it is an incredible resource yeah it would be a shame if it was less maintained in the future because of the you know this strange change and that we we feel like everything we want to contribute to we want to be an owner of and otherwise not contribute so yeah so with wikipedia with that example if you were trying to create a web 3 version of that do you think that's a worthwhile endeavor or or you know what would it look like that's different than the current version yeah well i guess the grand experiment would be that instead of having you know this loyal army of volunteers very very small minority of users give up their time to kind of sustain it you know if you had a group of people that were otherwise incentivized to not only sustain but innovate it right to like bring it to new levels or whatever you know there's i guess the negative argument would be hey first of all if it's not broken don't fix it but i don't like that argument generally because it doesn't bring us to extraordinary ends of anything um and so like what else would you do you know how would well look if he ever become an immersive experience um you know why aren't why isn't why doesn't wikipedia have a meme layer associated with it you know we know that memes are a compression vehicle for knowledge like but no one has an incentive right to build on top of wikipedia if you you know if it's still if it's just going to be part of the nonprofit unfortunately like it doesn't seem like it's attracting that level of like innovator necessarily um so i i that's an open question right if it were if it were sort of if it were an organization in which every participant gained tokens based on their contributions would there be 10x more contributors or there'd be 10x more developers would there be 10x more designers you know making mock-ups of concepts that are voted on and then executed and whatever or not would it just be like a you know a crazy crap storm of stuff without any you know centralized leader and decision maker like i don't know but it's definitely worth the experiment what if you made wikipedia into like a play to earn game greg um and you had to kind of like buy some number of wiki tokens in order to be a kind of builder and contributor on the platform and then you can earn them for contributing well and innovating around it um and then you kind of cap you know the ability for new people to buy into it so that it never becomes like centralized in the hands of one given party or body that would then control the internet i think uh so i love that i think gaming is a really great way to to get people to do things um and it's just a really great you know i'm curious scott's opinion but like great product design uh or experience to bring people together together immerse them and get them to click buttons so yeah i think if we were doing wikipedia 3.0 uh you know in web 3 it makes sense to to think about it in a gaming perspective yeah i'm inclined to agree in the sense that you know i've always felt like um you know leaderboards you know would incentivize you know further people to be kind of greatest contributors in certain verticals right and you know you're you you are always wanting to defend your position on that leaderboard and that means you have to do a great job in terms of community guidelines and you have to make sure that everything's factual and backed up and whatever i mean i think game mechanics ultimately you know drive those like ego analytics that make us feel like we're successful you know contributing in the right way to a product so it'd be super interesting to see that layer you know yeah yeah alexis ohanian has at 776 they have this internal proprietary software they built out called cerebro i think it's called like star trek reference um that manages like all of their internal stuff and one of the portals is this like value add like how can i help portal within it that actually gamifies their you know ability to execute against asks from portfolio companies and how much value they're adding and so like every single investment professional or team member at 776 has like a scorecard that shows up publicly every day and they all try to compete to see who can add more value to the portfolio and it's it's sort of brilliant right like they invested in axi so i know they understand gaming and and you know play to earn in general but it's kind of a brilliant way of just incentivizing people to actually execute against the whole how can i help thing that vc you know it's become a vc meme um you know make it less make it less meme-like and more reality you know in some ways like any mechanic that brings us back to the way things once were you know i i also shared in this article like that that's always my governing kind of compass for predictions is you know what sorts of technologies are enabling us to go back to the world we long for and so in some ways what did we do in the early days to amuse ourselves we just played games right i mean we competed in the gladiator arena we watched other people compete we you know we always were like having that sort of um very visceral physical like gaining mentality as as uh as early humans and so to bring in some of those mechanics to the types of you know work and kind of things we do together these days you know seems like a no-brainer yeah it's like um i think of it as like nostalgia as a service yeah like it brings brings you back um it actually ties into one of my favorite ones on your list too really well which is this whole idea of polygamous work um and the reason i think it ties in is because to your point on like arrows of progress being really around back to the way things once were i think of like the cl when you read the classics and you read the classic works of all of these like stoic philosophers or ancient greek philosophers so much of them was like they were grounded in being polymaths they weren't just one thing they were a philosopher they were a writer they were an athlete they you know they were like 10 things and they did all of them they were socialites and then somewhere along the way like the industrial age brought us this whole idea of you graduate college which you had to go and spend way too much money for you get done you take a job you work in that job for 40 years and then they give you a gold watch and you retire and that's your life that's what it looks like you hope you save enough money to be okay but that's your life um and i thought your way of phrasing the polygamous careers um was brilliant so i'd love to dive in on this one because i think there's also you know hundreds of businesses that are going to be built around this exact trend and this exact kind of flow of progress well i mean you're exactly right i think that uh i mean i've always found personally like you know that i'm most happy when i feel fully utilized and i feel fully utilized both in personal ways with my family and friends and then professionally i feel fully utilized both building products with teams helping founders go through problems of their own partnering with designers to solve gnarly problems and you know to have to pick one of those tracks as my full-time forever role would leave me depressed and i actually made that mistake once in my career um where i said okay i'm only going to be you know an investor and it just was like i felt like i'd hung up my sort of uh spurs you know in every other aspect of what i was proud of about myself and it just did not you know it wasn't it didn't it didn't work well for me so you know i think that the uh and to your point of the entire system right from college recruiting to healthcare linkedin profiles tax forms they're all geared towards monogamous careers and it's not really about people splitting themselves now why is but why is this suddenly a turning point like what's really systematically changing right now and why i mean first of all we've like grown up in the generation that's now in there you know entering the workforce they grew up with like constant bells and buzzers right they were in a hyper-networked world where they would be you know on facebook and then on a math tutor and then in roblox and chatting live with someone and live broadcasting something to their friends and whatever all in the same hour and so the idea of like building that skill set until you're 18 or whatever and then suddenly being told okay now your job is to just crank out excel spreadsheets at a bank you know that's going to be like such a drop in dopamine for lack of a better term i don't know like it's just going to be driving us nuts and so why you know what what does this new world look like right now a lot of people that are kind of anti this thesis would say one of two things oh that's just the millennials they're all selfish you know they don't want to like work hard you know and then others have told me hey um scott you're missing the fact that like specialization wins like i would only want to bet on people who truly specialize well to those people you know my one retort is that creativity is the new productivity you know we're going to stand out increasingly in our work and on social media and on any other thing that's you know amplifying our opportunity stream through our creativity you know it's not about doing things faster it's about standing out and doing things more beautifully and elegantly and whatever else and so if they're if we're all becoming artists of ai and robots you know is automating all the productivity side of our equation and it's all about creativity well then we you know we better be acting like artists and artists die when they become too specialized like the whole point of being an artist is to be like exposed to many mediums and constantly be changing your own craft yeah there's so much there to dig into so creativity is the new productivity i've never heard it phrased that way and that's brilliant um i think like i always go back to this whole concept of working like a lion not like a cow if you're if you're a creative worker you have to work like a lion it has to be bursts and sprints of creative energy followed by legitimate periods of rest and the industrial age work culture which we've that's persisted over the last several hundred years is not suited to that right you're supposed to go to the nine to five job that's like what 90 percent of people still do and it's what you're supposed to do and all of society and all of our infrastructure has been built on top of that to your point you know financial services is one of the hugest areas of disruption for this in my opinion because the way i put it is like 1099 income is effectively taxed at a much higher rate than w-2 not in the sense of like an actual tax rate but in the sense that you can't go get leverage on it good luck getting a mortgage with a bunch of 1099 income if you have a million dollars of 1099 income here and a million dollars of w-2 income here what is that worth to you in society a whole hell of a lot more on the w-2 side for better or for worse because all of the systems all of the underwriting everything has been built around it i mean we greg and i both have a friend who has like you know eight plus figures net worth and is not able to get like a really low rate loan um on a house and he could buy the house outright but he cannot do it because he doesn't really have w2 income that's crazy like that we live in a culture where that's the case and so i think there's all of these cool business opportunities that are going to be built around assuming this trend is real which i do personally believe it is building the infrastructure layer that allows polygamous workers to thrive in society in the same way that w-2 workers have been able to like i think there's this business collective a friend human radfar was the founder of that is like enabling 1099 workers from a kind of tax and back-end efficiency standpoint brilliant um things like you know new banking um for for businesses for startups for small businesses that enable you to do things more efficiently that are going to start being you know able to underwrite more effectively there's all sorts of businesses that i think are going to be built around this trend um but fixing the infrastructure is like it's the only thing that's going to allow it to really thrive and you know greg i feel like this is curious here your thoughts but i feel like this is an actual area where the notion of dows for future businesses might have a talent advantage because if you are just a rock star engineer or designer or whoever else who has this desire to have two or three irons in the fire that really fully utilize their skill sets and interests you know and subscribe to this new kind of polygamous career mo you know manifestation of you know or just or approach to life i guess you know they're not it's not like freelancers they're actually going to want to own right some of their outcome they're going to be they're going to want to be compensated based on their contributions not some like predetermined contract that's super ambiguous it's like i want to be compensated for the code that i connect for the design that gets in to production and you know are there models that could allow people to kind of you know have some percentage of various different projects you know act as an owner of those things you know be rewarded for their efforts to market it and almost almost behave like a founder i don't know if google still has it but they used to have this um i think they called a spot on bonus where you basically can give a co-worker 500 like almost at any time if they do something really great um and i thought that was really cool because it you know it's not about the money but just the fact that you know if you do good things here's a bonus and to your points got around like gen z especially like they need to be an environment that feels more like you know roblox than um you know doing data entry right or just not gonna work and what i love about uh dows is you you're you're getting dopamine you're getting dopamine by virtue of like the discord is buzzing there's community calls and most importantly um you're getting you know every day or every time you contribute um every time you commit code every time you design every time you do something you get that hit of like i just earned tokens yeah and it's funny like again back to that financialization of everything thing you know i don't want us to i don't want to turn us to all turn ourselves into hamsters you know where it's like do this get this do this get this and it just keeps like doing that over and over but i also wonder if you know there is some gain in empowerment right when you know that like every contribution you're making is being valued as opposed to like wondering you know whether you're just a cog in the system and not moving any needle forward so i think there's something to be explored here i do think that the companies that embrace this this you know new modern form of worker are going to have a talent advantage there's someone yeah there's someone i know who um well actually style and i talk a lot about balance and rest and and that all the time and there's someone i know who who's a part of a dow and this particular dow has this token that has just gone through the roof so you know he was getting you know a couple hundred dollars a week or a few thousand dollars a week um and it's now you know to do a couple tests and all of a sudden now i don't know what the number is but it's something crazy like 50 or 100 000 a week um and he's working 20 hours a day contributing to this doubt he quit his job and stuff like that and i facetimed with him and i like saw his eyes there's like either drooping he looked terrible he didn't shower it was like brutal and i was like dude you need to stop and he couldn't get him and he basically told me he's like i can't i can't stop so i think what we're gonna see is you're right like i think that like i think there's going to be a subset of people who are going to be contributing to dows who are going to be unable to basically take a step back and be like okay i need to go eat with my family i need to take a shower etc and that's scary there's a there's also just going to be opportunities around like the polygamous worker operating system um both from a company standpoint and from an actual individual standpoint where like right now all of these companies have built um uh the kind of operating system for like managing hybrid workforces or managing remote workforces right there's all these great businesses out there that are doing that that enable like talent hr teams whatever to manage where are people working when are they working etc but like extending that to now i have workers who are working maybe 20 of their time i have like a two-day you know worker and i need to make sure that um you know we're optimizing what they're working on when they're working on maybe i want to make them 40 rather than 20 and kind of manage that and negotiate it like the operating system to do all that i think has yet to be built um around this you know kind of polygamous work future um and it's pretty interesting because right now it's like really fly-by-night [ __ ] if you're a 1099 worker and you're trying to do a bunch of different projects where do you go like maybe you have an upwork profile maybe you're on fiverr you know maybe your kind of tweet you know twitter dm'ing with people to do some work there's no like central portal that actually allows you to kind of you know manage all of this in one place and have the companies be able to like manage trade etc i think it's a great it's a great opportunity because being in a big company i know how hard it is to bring on a freelancer to do a specific project for us and you kind of have to go through someone else and yeah and if you're in new york or california yeah good luck it's crazy and and yet i've also seen the other side of this you know having built behance and seen the creative careers of the most talented people i you know on the network that i always followed those folks they don't work for anyone like they work for lots of different people right they don't work for any one particular company only is what i mean to say if you're like an incredible illustrator typographer a person like jessica hish or if you're a you know just an amazing you know motion graphics designer or data data infographic kind of person or whatever like you are you are working for the best agencies and brands in the world and whether it's nike or whoever else like you know they're kind of working with you at your terms because they want your skill set um but those people are so famous that you know they can get companies to bend over backwards to have to work with them but if that's any lead indicator of what the best talent in the world will be doing in the future you know i think it's a i think it's a decent one and i think that to your point the system that allows folks to be engaged by many different brands and projects without friction you know that that just unlocks a massive talent advantage for the um you know for the companies ultimately so yeah and for the people it's more efficient pricing of their services right if it's all in one place you don't get these like massive gaps um you know it's like a much more efficient market for them which is good for the individual so you can kind of like um you know you can onboard people that way because you're actually they're not going to have the friction cost it'll just be like pretty transparent that's right yeah and scott used this use this word scott um or two or just to say um standing out it's really about standing out and i think that's so true that um i'm happy that we're you know going to 2022 where it's you know it's not about you know if you graduate a certain school or so to speak it's about just um can you be creative and can you stand out amongst the sea i mean it's that's very difficult but i think that if you you know for everyone who's listening um if you can you know orient yourself around standing out i think that's going to go a long way i think that's right and that's also why i feel like the democratization of these creative tools that let you stand out is also so critical um you know another one of my sort of thoughts in this piece was around the the mainstream of 3d creation because i just feel like right now it's still something that's pretty hard to do and most of us you know can't just create in 3d but uh you know if we're if we're starting to have experiences with each other in vr in soon ar i feel like just like you know facebook started to introduce photos into the activity feed actually like after their launch like it was just the profile photo as we might remember and then photo and everyone sort of became a photographer once social media welcomed photography as a mainstream you know part of the product and cameras on our phones allowed us all to be photographers and edit our photos same exact thing's gonna happen for 3d i'm like wholly convinced that that's the case and uh and you know but the tools don't exist for that yet which is pretty exciting but yes standing out i mean we're at the end of the day we're all brands to some extent and we're all only as late as good and fresh as our latest content right yeah yeah and i think it's like what does that really mean concretely like standing out it's like understanding like cultural zeitgeist and you know if people are going this you know zigging this way like zagging and using design and creativity to to be different and so you stand out on a timeline you stand out on a feed exactly yeah and it's it's just like we we fundamentally now live in a very very cool era for entrepreneurs um i'm not old enough to say that it's like you know the first time in history but the barriers to starting something are so damn low i mean with no code low code um you know with communities being able to actually surface and find niche communities as quickly as possible i mean if you were to just like very quickly want to come up with a business idea you go out and find a large market say financial services you go find a niche community that is underserved by incumbents within that you go ask a hundred of them have a hundred conversations and ask them what their pain points are and then you go use no code low code to build something that is like very well suited to that niche tiny community you can spin up a business in an i don't know a week if you wanted to and like get something off the ground and start it um and for very i mean you can go use like uh one of these um services to hire developer talent to build something out very cost effectively like it is amazing the era we live in if you're entrepreneurial and you have a builder mindset i i love that i i i totally agree with you and you know i think obviously spotify and shopify and some of the other companies that are long tail e-commerce you know these are the companies that are enabling right exactly what you're saying arming the rebels and in 10 years from now i think we're going to see probably 10x the number of small businesses as there are today and uh and we'll probably we'll probably have more long tail purchases you know in our lives than we do today as well i think it's partly because of the hyper personalization targeted ad stuff we were talking about earlier you know greg can instead of five percent of his wardrobe it can be 15 of his wardrobe that's from like super niche you know uh makers of stuff that you know are uniquely tuned to him but i also think that we're going to want more of this back to the whole like we go back to the way things once were we're going to want to patronize local artisans and small shops or the if the future equivalent of local artisans maybe is the person who like stitches t-shirts on ebay you know with like opposite color stitching sorry etsy maybe not ebay um you know uh and makes like custom things on etsy and that's like our t-shirt person and whatever else and so that that long tail of small businesses that you know that make our lives rich and interesting i think that's a great positive trend for society and culture there's like an inherent tension here though right where um yes technology is enabling this long tail to exist you're able to like rent capacity um you know contract manufacturers if you're building products or at aws if you're building um you know services or tech and um and that enables a lot at the same time power laws suggest that all of the winnings are going to a fewer number of people and like i've thought about this tension recently in a very weird context with music where i was listening to like throwback 90s singing the card jams or something on spotify and there are an unbelievable number of songs by artists that i don't know that they produced any other song like it was you know uh steal my sunshine by like ellie n amazing song like generationally good song um don't know if they produce anything else like i i do feel as though as technology has progressed there may be fewer of those like random one-hit wonder types because all the algorithm just keeps pushing you to the exact same like small set of songs where in the past radio basically said if you can get your single on the radio uh you know you could have like just one song that just happened to be a massive hit and and took off and so like i'm wrestling with this inherent tension and maybe i'm maybe i'm just misunderstanding it but i am feeling this tension that exists between like the idea of power laws and technology and what it does um and this whole idea of enabling the long tail to exist and thrive yeah it's really because there's you know there's some behaviors we have in culture where we don't ever want to be like wearing the same thing as everyone else we don't want to eat the same thing as everyone else versus desire it seems to you know to seek originality right and to express yourself creatively through your originality which i mean i guess your point we could all be buying it off of amazon so there's the power law at work for you um but i just i just can't help but wonder like for example i've been watching this company called the custom movement where they um have artists personalized or customized shoes and it's just like huge marketplace now of people who essentially are riding buying like the white classic nikes and then they're just like doing amazing it was a yc company back you know many years ago not many but like five years ago maybe and you know it's it's artists like personalizing everything for everyone and the idea of like why wouldn't you want personal apparel and shoes that are one of a kind and uniquely catered to you and that's great for an artist out there that's great for a small business it also might be good for nike if they're making the underlying shoes but it's uh i can see the the two fighting i mean there will be like the cost curves you know fighting in favor of power laws and then there will be originality maybe on the other side yeah maybe well it'll be interesting to see it play out over the next five ten years um this was this was absolutely awesome man i feel like we've taken up a bunch of your time more than i expected we would just because we got so deep down these rabbit holes but um this was incredible um and some just amazing interesting ideas and insights and and um there are a few business ideas in here that if there are entrepreneurs out there who are listening to this that want to go build this the like uh local um customization optimization for hospitality sas play if there's someone out there scott me greg hit us up because i'm super super interested in that um but uh no thank you so much scott this was freaking awesome i'm glad we uh glad we got to do it i can't believe this is the first time we've actually interacted somewhat face to face in in person here but uh no guys great thanks for thanks first of all for doing these conversations in the first place and uh and for having me i'm excited should be a fascinating year ahead that's for sure yeah no and thank you for for publishing your notes your notion basically uh with the world because i think uh it's a it's a domino effect that's the best way to describe it i think a lot of people read that and we had a lot of chatter about in our discord um and so you know thank you for that inspiration and it's gonna be a hell of a year so a lot of trends a lot of stuff happening and um thank you so much scott absolutely thank you guys talk soon all right cool wow that was [ __ ] crazy [Laughter] one of my favorite parts about starting islands my last company was jamming with scott belski because he invested in the company we would have these conversations just like the one we had now about where the trends are going and what opportunities exist and more often than not scott is completely on the mark and it's such a pleasure he's such a nice guy my brain is absolutely spinning with ideas right now uh we had a few good ones so would it you know what did you think oh i i mean first off just an awesome guy um i had never met him face to face uh and i feel like i was best friends i mean just like he feels like your friend right away crazy smart um to your point at the end i mean i love that he's willing to just like put himself in the intellectual gauntlet i actually found it fascinating at the beginning when we talk through his um his process like how he jots down notes and he's like a compulsive compulsive um like note jotter and his notion doc and then kind of starts to aggregate and synthesize um i'm probably gonna implement that this year actually it's just like things i'm observing i'm just gonna have one one page where i drop down big observations to try to synthesize i love that he sends it to people and like has people spar with his ideas that's just such like a cool concept to me and so interesting um in terms of takeaways i mean i had i had a bunch um my biggest if i had to pinpoint one i think it's that business idea around you know a sas platform for like customized hospitality experiences um i think that is fascinating i'm a little bit shocked that it doesn't already exist but i think it's like a brilliant thing you could start at a regional level with a pretty light touch effort very little you know development build out and honestly i mean you could focus it'd be a huge driver for mom and pops for smaller restaurants smaller hospitality chains um i think it's really really interesting it goes to that mental model of like taking what the highest end premium experiences already do and bringing it to everybody um like that model that framework of doing business because the four seasons sort of does this like they once you've gone there they'll start to pattern what you like what you don't like what newspaper etc and then they provide it to you but doing that at a scale where smaller mom and pops smaller businesses are able to access and deliver that same set of experiences is an amazing business idea so i'm like i'm hooked on that i want to get into the community and jam on that more because i think there's something super interesting there to be built yeah i i think you're absolutely right um and like we talked about like could start on web two definitely a web three opportunity there also i loved talking about wikipedia by the way because it was a reminder that um you know if we lost wikipedia that would really suck um so uh yeah that was super amazing scott's an idea machine so um i loved it i'm so glad we got to do it to start the year i mean it's like a great way to frame up the year too and just like start thinking big to start 2022. so for everyone out there uh i hope you enjoyed it as much as we did and we're going to get scott into the community we'll go deeper on all of this and the discord um so so excited to release this one and uh and go further on

missed you all right well we'll see you out tomorrow night then we'll look forward to it we'll cheers so gary you've been consistently right at predicting you know where things are you know are going and now you know we've been following v friends since the beginning we love the project so much um what got you into nft communities in this whole web 3 world um basically an incredible combination of my entire life right like i'm in my office obviously i put out a lot of content so people have seen this like i've been collecting things my whole life right sports cards it's just who i am um wine collecting and i've been you know at the forefront of consumer trends and so there's videos of me in 2010 talking about virtual currency and farmville and you know um just a a brouhaha of events um culminating with the explosion of sports cards again which kept me even closer to collectibles covid allowing for a lot of interesting behaviors to pop up natural things that were happening like roblox and fortnite and nba 2k and madden skins and i've just been watching the digital thing being an early investor in ethereum and really just seeing nba top shot and crypto punks happen and did my 30 40 hours of homework on the current state of nfts not what i knew about cryptokitties in 2017 and basically did what i do all the time whether that was snapchat or tick tock or musically or podcasting or to your point i i'm very fortunate at this point to have a reputation of being solid at having a sense of what's happening and that's what happened to me i i thought nfts were going to happen and they've happened and the way i've learned learned my whole career is by doing and so i knew i had to have my own project i've been working on a toy brand called workplace warriors for a long time um and that in essence was v friends so it wasn't hard for me to take these characters like patient panda and empathy elephant and turn them into an nft project instead of a collectible toys project so i'm incredibly excited to be at the forefront of this stuff and nfts for me are an opportunity for human beings to create economies and economies are healthy when you bring value to the economy and i'm very good at bringing value to my constituents and that is my plan with this project can you i just want to double down on one thing you said right there sorry so you said like the 30 to 40 hours of homework you did what is your process so many people would benefit from hearing this like when you get excited about a new idea you're a very curious person everything i've always listened to and read about you is just like your innate curiosity is very real how do you go do that 30 40 hours of homework like do you have a special way that you go into that rabbit hole to figure something out yep first it's the mental commitment right it's like i'm doing this right like so it starts with mental commitment because my time is valuable um everyone's time is valuable my time is valuable because of the opportunities i have other people's time is valuable because people perceive their time as valuable so people don't like wasting time on something that's a fad i've always used humility and curiosity to say an intuition to say okay there's something here when it's something as new as nfts i start with youtube because i don't read well but i listen well and watch well so it was literally like nft 101 videos you know and then i then it was very heavy twitter search which led me to realizing people were very very aggressively active on discord so then i joined a bunch of discords and then listened to podcasts read a ton of twitter hours and hours of twitter conversations had hypotheses googled those hypotheses googled the counterpoint to those hypotheses that's important i'm very careful to not get caught in the eco chamber i'm almost like a i'm a boxer i'm a counter puncher right i i want to know the alternative the right click and save the bad for the environment the fads like i want to know every counterpoint i it's what keeps me from going in on things it's why i'm not loud about everything it's why i can be quiet or talk about the same thing for a year and a half it means nothing's come along that is worthy of my reputational risk to get loud about um so that that's my process let's talk about uh failure for a second i know how bullish you are on nfts i'm you know we're both super bullish how do how does nfts fail that you know is there a world where this just doesn't pan out no but that's the macro that says if you asked me this question in 1996 about the internet right calm 99 of the projects on the open c top rankings top 200 right now are incredibly vulnerable against their valuation let me say that nice and slow 99 and by the way for everybody's watching whether that's 90 or 93 or 99 percent like right the far majority of i'm gonna do it right now in real time i'm going right now to open c i'll pull it up too yep i'm going to rankings i'm doing last i'm gonna do all i'm gonna do last 30 days all chains when i look at you know even the icons like board ape and crypto punks like doodles great project chain runners super interesting cool cats kryptos i love gremlin uh cybercons killing it artifact had their monster dropped the littles has some momentum right now right um um swamp first is a cute little one that i'm pretty hot on um me bits an iconic one from the crypto punks comic doing everything right lately and structurally in my opinion v friends my own um creature world i've been on the record of what i think about danny call lazy lions a really emphatic community um every one of the things i just mentioned vulnerable so how do you you know why because they're too valuable right now right but but guess what in what i just mentioned there's an ebay and amazon in 1999. the problem is there's an error over progress the arrow of progress is pointing up and if you go and bet on the space the macro it's headed in that direction does those blockchains that do affirmation of ownership and contracts is here for the rest of everyone's life right it's here so what is the right way then for somebody slowly when people say or nf power nfts i say stuffed animals stuffed animals have been here to stay for the last 200 years not every stuffed animal company has turned out well beanie babies was a fad strawberry strawberry shortcake my little pony have been iconic garb cabbage patch kids iconic in some ways disney stuff other things you know the wuzzles had a good year stuffed animals were here to stay not every stuffed animal toys and collectibles are here to stay not every toy and collectible was worth money art is here to stay sports cards are here to stay not every sports card nfts are here to stay for the rest of our lives the the far majority of projects in this gold rush cannot maintain their value because the supply of nfts that are coming into the market is extraordinary so how do we create i totally agree with you i think and i think it's like a great analogy that you're making to the dot-com burst as an example pets.com and the way i think about it is like okay if i'm a normal person then what i want to do is i want to invest in the nasdaq like i just want to invest in the index of the entire thing because i know that it's headed that way and it's going to be amazing and there's a bright future you mean ethereum yeah well so that's the question i have for you right but it is ethereum yahoo and is going to win the first seven years of search and is is solana gonna come is it solana is it ethereum is it something we don't know the answer is you can diversify i'm sitting on e i'm sitting on other currencies i'm buying a ton of different nft the reason i went into nfts more than currency is my theory is if ethereum loses i can bridge over my crypto punks right so to me the nft asset class feels in a lot of ways like an easier bet if you feel like you really know which nfts you want to invest in but then you kind of need a way to do that because not everyone has your specific knowledge base or your ability to understand all the nuance and go and learn it there are going to be people my parents as an example they might want to participate in this growth so that they can benefit from it in their retirement right your parents will participate leisurely because they have a son who's going to be like hey you should buy this one or to your point they'll buy bitcoin or ethereum or or maybe in a year solana or something else and that's going to be it like like what people you guys are youngsters what i learned in 95 6 7 8 9 10 2000 2001 with wine library was at first everybody told me nobody would ever buy wine on the internet like at all so that was where we're at now nfts are stupid right click all that right it's so funny i have a lot of friends in her 40s and 50s who became their parents people that don't understand nfts that make that joke are the same people that didn't get a cell phone because they liked their pager yeah it's easier to hate on nft on nfts i think than to embrace it for the vast majority of what you need a newsletter everyone hated on the iphone over to blackberry everybody hated on cell phones over pagers everybody hated on websites over newspapers like again you guys are young enough that you haven't been through enough cycles you know it you read it i read about home computers that's how i projected the internet but like it's just super clear like people hate on all big shifts because they don't understand it so how do you figure out what you mentioned your process of learning about the one once you fit once you kind of start to have that inkling do you just surround yourself or talk to the smartest people you know to figure out what are they excited about what are they working on on the weekends so that you can then go learn about those things like how do you actually get that first spark of curiosity either a random tweet comment on my social cold email because of where i am in my career or to your point no question kevin rose one of the smarter consumer internet people i know when we were talking about x-men comics and jordan rookie cards when he said hey do you know what a crypto do you have a crypto punk and i said i'm not sure what that is and he said you remember cryptokitties i was like of course like i'd already known about top shot i met rohan a couple months before top shot launched i knew nfts were brewing i was busy it was the holidays last year last year was still very hardcore covid so i was trying to navigate my company um but as soon as he said that i'm like you know what i'm gonna dig in a little bit deeper and so yes and what's been really ironic whether it's dave morin whether you know it's kevin colleran whether it's msg or harper reed or you know aaron battalion you know scott belski mike lazarow all these people that succeeded in web 2 right that i respected and thought were thoughtful miraculously in january february we're all circling around like buzzards i'm getting a text from friends that i haven't talked to in six months six years because we've all been a little bit out of the white hot moment of 2007 to 11 of web 2. sure enough even even people that aren't in it right now that are a little bit more discreet which is why i'm not going to mention them um who really made some serious wins in web 2. even they reached out in february march and say they're kind of demotivated or focused on other things but even they were like hey what is this thing uh you could see the spidey senses of the people that really understand when [ __ ] changes and then a couple of icons again i won't mention them who really didn't get it and came back to me in the last six to eight weeks and said [ __ ] and i remember like being disappointed in them like oh i lost they lost their edge or they don't give a [ __ ] or or one of two things they got soft because they have too much money or the better version they made so much money they're on to fixing the environment or the political system they went altruistic right so you know it's it's really fun to watch humans evolve but yes keeping people again when you guys get to my age you've got that extra generation you're going to have your whole little crew of the people you've decided over this decade are smart are good and you'll find it fascinating in 20 years when the next thing pops off you'll be surprised how many of them are like it's been a renaissance for some of my good friends of web 2 and we're enjoying it because it feels like the old days right you can you can it feels like web 2 0's beginning when nobody understood social media and content that's exactly what's happening with nfts did you uh did you follow aaron levy in real time transitioning from like an anti-web 3 guy to like the most pro web 3 guy in the span of like 72 hours you know aaron was never really we were never in each other's circle heavy obviously connected through many different people but never really we never really got to chop so between that and just you know how much information is being thrown around and usually i pride myself in seeing that i miss that but it makes so much sense right like all of us have to go through it it's like look i invested in ethereum and bitcoin in 1516 i kind of glanced at cryptokitties i didn't buy one you know you you're you're in what you're in and you get busy and you get your life evolves what you're able to capacity do in your late 20s is different as your family grows up and like it you know like humility and curiosity will cure success to be good at this i rely on those things but even for me like there's a million things going on he can't get to everything what i love in what you just said is the humility even with his success to be able to quote unquote evolve in front of everybody and not fear changing his mind because i think changing your mind is a huge strength i actually think there's a lot of people right now that are in a really tough spot because they've been very anti-nft they've had the aha that it's real and they don't have the humility to say they were wrong and they're going to double down on something they don't believe in and i hope they see this clip and it makes them feel comfortable to change their mind yeah so what you're saying is like it's okay to change your mind it's actually a competitive advantage it's a competitive advantage like i'm never scared to say i'm wrong i didn't see it like like i love that one thing that's funny about me is i do that all the time one thing that people would be very confused by hearing because i don't think people should spend the time to really pay attention to me to understand every little nuance i just never get loud when i'm not at a hundred percent if i'm at 97 i won't make a single comment publicly about it until i cross the chasm that's why you see me get so loud it's when i get to a hundred musically tick-tock snapchat uh you know podcast uh nfts once i get to 100 there's zero data on my mind and i go pop committed reputation on the line but you should see i mean you know you know how little vr content there is in the world for me because i'm still in 97 i i don't have my hundred percent so i'm scared to say anything i don't get interesting you understand there's so much content of me on the internet you guys know this plenty of people don't love my aggressive communication style and i'm empathetic to that if i gave people ammo of being wrong a lot they would [ __ ] make unlimited videos of me being wrong there's not that many you know why because i don't try to say [ __ ] about things i don't know you're not scott galloway with the uh with the predictions on tech companies yeah to me that's you know i love scott too and i'm not i'm not yeah i love him too actually i think he's amazing yeah i'm scared to do that i don't want as a matter of fact one of i got very lucky there's a very funny video of me in a suit by the way which is rare because i was doing this show the daily when the ipad came out and they asked me to do a prediction show and i fought like hell i didn't even wear this is a you were about to get a funny very nerdy garyvee scoop i was supposed to wear a tuxedo for the new year's episode which i had because i'd go to weddings right but i didn't wear it with the hope that they were going to get upset because they were very professional and and like let me not do it that's how much i didn't want to do a prediction show because i'm scared to predict ironically it turned into one of my best moments because i predicted that facebook was going to buy instagram and they did but i don't like predicting i don't predict i observe and then i'm emphatic about my observation when it crosses my 101 percentile belief chasm which is fairly rare if you look at my content over the last decade i'm only talking about seven or ten things i'm just not willing to be wrong if i can help it what do you what do you what do you observe around brands and nfts so i think we went through i think it's gonna i'm sorry interrupt i think it's gonna be just like social ninety percent up front i'm gonna make garbage ten percent if you remember early brands on social zappos had a big move on it that worked for them there were some other brands that did a really nice job then you look at brands that were built from social jim shark i just joined the board fashion nova another one you know like casper i mean we can go on and on with a lot of brands that we're building so social um but 90 will be done poorly and 10 will be done awesome i you know i'm very proud you're catching me at a funny time we just launched our we're working for four months on the budweiser launch that we had and if you look at you know it was very strong yesterday because we really know what we're talking about to their credit they really let us do the right thing and so you know vayner nft with avery at the helm she's amazing we're gonna do good work and a lot of other companies will pop up and do good work build equity with brands and just like anything with brands ninety percent will be atrocious because it's a transactional short cheesy tone-deaf not understanding but i do think you'll see some gems in there brands have money and leverage access so they can do some really cool stuff with their smart contracts right so when we look at you know the openc you know it's 2026 and we're looking at openc last 30-day sales when we went through that list that was mostly web 3 brands do we think you know it's going to be 50 50 you know old school brands with web3 brand 7525 any any insight there um i think it'll be 10 brands 20 brands i think you'll see publishers gaming companies like ip that we right now v friends board ape cool cats ip getting established but you're going to see hello kitty you're going to see the flintstones so you're going to see some icons harry potter you're going to see some new stuff the friends of board ape is going to feel like icons because we'll be old by then new [ __ ] will pop up brands will be there really social media you'll see jennifer aniston join late and get fi right right jay-z jointly and you'll see charlie demilio and logan paul build from there and everything in between it makes sense the so the hit the couple like the three pretty actionable things that i'm taking away from hearing you talk about this stuff one is like the importance of skin in the game like if you're gonna go learn something you've got to put some skin in the game and that is the best way to learn because suddenly you're like really invested in it two it's like the willingness to just admit you don't [ __ ] know something and not be afraid to admit that and continue to own that until you do know it and for you like you're saying 97 96 for some people that might be like you know 20 30 just continuing to say i don't know i don't have an opinion on this because i haven't earned the right to have that opinion yet um and then the third one for me is just like be willing to change your mind and go search for those counter punches the way you put it of the people that just disagree with you that you're like oh [ __ ] yeah i'm not actually thinking about that the right way i was flipped completely opposite of how i should have been like those three things to me are really popping out of what you're saying i think it's extremely good recap you know usually i'm pretty long-winded but i don't have much to add to that i think that's a the right recap i think i think i have so much confidence i have so much conviction and i have so much energy that what is incredibly difficult to see unless you're on the inside with me is i use humility as my biggest core driver i'm not scared because i don't think i'm special like this is really important i don't think i'm better than any man or woman i really don't i'm aware that i'm professionally successful i'm aware that i have nice relationships so are hundreds of millions of people i genuinely believe what makes everything palpable for me and others that have something is humility it's also what grounds you in the ability to innovate yep absolutely so i know we've got a couple minutes left i do need to ask you the question of for any listeners out there i mean i've taken so much personally from watching you and listening to your different um your different social accounts and things you've been saying publicly for years like what are the two or three pieces of advice one piece of advice you give to an 18 year old a 22 year old and you know maybe they don't come from the best situation they're not they didn't grow up in a wealthy family yeah walk me it didn't work is that gary's great i love that i mean i've been really thinking like honestly look at number one honestly no matter yeah no matter what you come from let me give you one that i think is a secret of life ready for this this one blows me away not everyone has this many don't but many do if you grow up in a family that doesn't have a very big financial bag middle call it lower middle class and down and you have happiness in your home you are winning if you are trained in the first 18 years of your life that happiness and joy is not attached to money you are unstoppable and you're looking at that person right now and i realized it when i started seeing patterns if you're grateful for what you have instead of envious for what you don't have you will always win there will always be somebody with more money there will always be somebody that's better looking there's always somebody more athletic better grades nicer car there always will be there's also always going to be somebody that's less there's 850 million people on this earth that do not have access to clean fresh water there's nobody watching this video right now that isn't in a remarkable situation compared to the 8 billion i don't know what else to tell you like once you get there once you really lean into gratitude everything else clicks i'm gonna give you another one since it's right here on my desk number three is probably leading to the most happiness for me i don't think our world right now is built on valuing accountability we're in full blame mode and that's why so many people are upset personal accountability it's huge can you talk more about that yeah yeah when when you don't focus on what you've done wrong and you're in full blame game when you're in fingers instead of thumbs you don't feel in control which then immediately makes you upset like if you think it's the government's fault or your teacher's fault or your parents fault or your boyfriend's fault or your girlfriend's fault or your brother's fault or society's fault or luck's fault or if you think it's something else's fault you by nature are giving up control giving up control feels very helpless and very desperate and i'm it i i feel like accountability makes me happy i think everything at vaynermedia is my fault now that's a very overarching thing but here's where i go with it if sally the vp screws up or rick the vp screws up well i hired the person that hired them the end right and i think that right now because of social media the mainstream media our social unrest for a decade it's just [ __ ] you know i've been thinking a lot about this lately that the world is very passionate to go blue and red not just politically just like how everyone's living their life and like so much of my happiness comes from purple and i've been thinking a lot about that i think accountability is incredibly important i really do like what what have you done like it's almost like man you could do anything like i love the fact that you can do anything like even if you don't like the country you live in no matter where you are canada america russia china you know and everything in between like you could immigrate my parents did you know this is why i love web 3 by the way is this exact idea like we've now had conversations with some of the most amazing minds in web 3 and one of the things that i just blows me away about everything about it is it doesn't matter if you're a kid on the street in india my family's from india growing up with nothing or if you're a country club kid growing up in greenwich connecticut you have access to the internet and you can contribute and you can be in these communities you can get in a discord you can talk to people you can build with other people and the promise of that is so inspiring that it's hard not to get behind it and want to invest in it the end the end the end we just we just um we just spoke to geo the co-founder of uh axey infinity yep and we're like how did you co-found axiomfinity he's like i literally joined the discord and then i became a co-founder he was mopping floors in the district he was like i was the community i was like i was running yeah i joined the discord this is a very special time i hope people take advantage of it i have to go to a family thing right now so i gotta go but it's a special time don't miss you're watching this video you're ahead of 99 of the world do something about it cheers well we appreciate you gary thank you guys thank you so much man we'll see you soon cheers bye-bye see ya legend what a legend dude i want to go run through a brick wall right now what an absolute legend we're still on oh we're still hot well he's a total [ __ ] legend i was like i'm sweating like i want to go run through a brick wall that was great especially that ending yes that ending was really uplifting it really fires me up man that was so cool really really cool um takeaways ah geez so i mean i summarized it when i was on there but like for me the coolest things he said um skin in the game when he was just saying like one of the first things he does as part of his process is he goes and like puts a little into it um to force himself to learn i'm a big believer in that like when we when you first got me in nfts the first thing i did was go and do something stupid like i i didn't mean to but i put some skin in the game and i lost a bunch of money on ether lambos and that was a great learning experience for me i learned a lot from it that's a that was a great one for me and then the other two were like kind of connected but just don't be afraid to say i don't know about things i thought that was so cool the way he said he doesn't publicly say something until he's 100 on it and then he gets loud and so people like oh this guy's allowed but you don't see all the background all the work he's done to get to a hundred on it and then that final one of just like be willing to change your mind right is such a powerful concept and so many people can learn from that because we live in this polarized black and white culture where you're not supposed to change your mind you're supposed to be we used to like criticize politicians for being flip-floppers personally i look at that and say that's actually a pretty powerful thing that someone was able to change their mind on an issue um and so shifting the culture around that and his points on that i thought were just so so astute for me uh what do you call it the counter punches yeah i like that counter punches so understand them so for example uh with nfts there's a bunch of counter punch arguments which is like it's bad for the environment it's a ponzi scheme uh like so list it out and go actually do the research and try to understand and have a point of view and i feel like not enough people you know on both sides like either pro nfts or or anti-nfts or pro this political party or auntie you know and all assets a lot aspects of life i think we don't do a good enough job at understanding the counter punches i agree with that i also think it's because like social media culture has made the like little quick quip um you get a dopamine hit from that because you do the little like ngmi to somebody that says they don't understand it or they provide a counter okay boomer no and people like it and people go like it now you're like oh saying ngm i got me a bunch of likes i'm gonna keep doing that but the reality is when someone says like oh i don't understand how this works nick huber our friend like constantly does that he questions these different things in web3 and crypto for me i find it as like personally motivating to them to try to understand why he thinks that and how you can figure it out but the natural reaction on social is to just like yell at the person attack yeah attack and it doesn't do you any good when you do that you actually aren't learning you're not developing you're not strengthening your point of view and anything you're just ignoring a counterargument to it and especially if the counter argument comes from someone you consider intelligent or credible it's worth listening to yeah i think what i've noticed on places like twitter is that it feels like everyone is attacking everyone a lot of the times and it doesn't need to be the case like it's totally cool to ask questions learn understand counter punches so i think uh listen i thought that conversation went really well and it it started at web 3 and i think it ended at um like life lessons so yeah i mean i think it's funny for me because like gary um i've never met him i know him from his online personas and the things he's done and i've always admired his energy and enthusiasm around different issues and things he's working on but i came away from that just being like this [ __ ] is the real deal man i mean like i got fired up listening to him he is motivating he's inspiring but he's also humble and his humility around learning these things and wanting to dive in his track record of getting things right once he dives in on things and figuring them out he's not just some like motivation guy you know that's just out there motivating people like he is really in the weeds putting his money where his mouth is diving in on things like in the in the battle in the trenches um i i mean i was blown away i love it i thought it was awesome that was awesome we're looking forward to getting in the community after this we're gonna do our best to get gary in there with us to jam with everybody we'll do a twitter spaces with him or something like that to go deeper on these things but holy

what a 15 year old today can do is already so impressive and then when they're building on top of libraries not to mention no code like you can get that mvp up much easier and so that's why i've been pushing and i pushed it on twitter before this uh interview the minimum viable community is going to become the new standard and you're already seeing it in pfp projects you're already seeing it across crypto um i think you all are clearly building a business around this concept that is the new challenge and and the core reason for that is everyone is overwhelmed with options attention is scarce as a result and one of the best moats for that is community and and i know that because i lived it like read it for five years between i left in 2010 i came back in early you know late 14 as exec chair had almost no investment by con and asked in the product the product didn't improve for half a decade barely stayed online okay there's no business on the planet let alone in tech that should be allowed to do nothing for five years five years and grow every single year that should not be allowed that breaks every rule and the reason it broke those rules is because of community because we got just enough right that there was a self-fulfilling little flywheel of users who just cared about spending time with other random anonymous users on the internet in these communities and it not only kept the site alive it kept growing and thriving and and so as i watch everything that now unfolds under web 3 i'm like i've seen that i i know this very well like the thing that drives all the success for this next wave of internet is going to start with community and and that's a big deal

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
okay lightning round you live in the future give me one to three things that are your predictions for where we're gonna be in the future well how future you define like five years about five years um i think everyone in five years will participate in a dow they won't know it necessarily i don't think that branding is is whack um but they it won't count right user experience triumphs over everything so yeah i think it will be pretty commonplace not maybe not everyone but like for all intents and purposes it'll be a pretty normal thing for people to participate in dao's um five years uh people will in five years agree with the statement that a famous vc asked me like 10 years ago what's something that you believe that the rest of the world were and uh and i told them that people will care more or do care more and will care more about their online identity than their offline one they'll care more about some pseudonym they made up than their government name and so i think in five years that will be true and then give me a play to earn one oh great one okay in five years no one 90 of people will not play a game unless they are being properly valued for that time and so the idea if you're messing around you're on candy crush right now you're listening to this thing in the background i caught you you should be paying attention kev got caught and and i caught you because in five years you will actually value your time properly and instead of being harvested for advertisements or being fleeced for dollars to buy you know stupid hammers you don't actually own you will be playing some on chain equivalent game that will be just as fun but you'll actually earn value in you will be the harvester yes yeah instead of the harvesty yes and you deserve it you deserve it you've been crushing that candy for too long uh for free or you're actually getting charged for it so it's amazing

all right guys we just got done filming a crazy episode with alexis ohanian founder of reddit now the founder of 776 a new venture capital fund that's building very differently i had a blast tell me tell me about it i mean there was just so much to take away from it his storytelling around the reddit experience building that the early days of y combinator and the early days of of uh you know completely changing the game of the incubator ecosystem was really really cool to hear for me the minimum viable community stuff that he talked about was my biggest takeaway and how people that are really building community first organizations um are going to continue to be the ones that win in the long run yeah alexis is an absolute community legend i think you know i remember people telling me like hey stop playing so many video games stop like spending all this time on internet forums and stuff like that and we're realizing now in 2021 2022 that those skills around bringing people together through the internet are the crucial skills for how to build companies of the future community-based companies so i absolutely loved every word he said around community around designing these community-based experiences and uh he's just dropping bombs after bombs yeah it was crazy he's from the future and he drops a bunch of bombs from the future that make this episode an absolute killer so we know you guys are gonna enjoy it let's dive right in i hate banking most banking products suck so when i was starting all these new businesses and going on this new adventure i turned to mercury mercury is banking four founders by founders they make everything so easy and a beautiful elegant design there's free wires virtual and physical debit cards they even have a raising platform where

there's everything now there's gonna be stocks there's crypto we're in this crazy world where there's so many different investment opportunities which just means there's so many opportunities to learn and common stock is creating the platform for you to learn alongside the best and also as i said let your gains speak so to level up your investing game today check out commonstock.com you won't regret it so this is gonna be a lot of fun and this is like a day we've both been looking forward to for a while and the reason is because we've got a community legend on and i've got my community friend and we're gonna have a community legend in alexis ohanian founder of reddit has built a bunch of other online communities and i'm personally just excited because we're going to be able to get in a room with two people that i think really really understand community at a depth that i definitely don't i think a lot of our audience will benefit from yeah and he understands community but he also is like me equally obsessed with web 3. and i'm excited to dive into you know why he's interested in web 3 the relationship between what he's learned building community at reddit and what that you know what is the relationship between web 2 and web3 and and just get into lessons learned yeah it's interesting i mean like so i want you to talk to me a little bit before he comes in to just prime me because i consider myself a little bit of just like uh i don't know what the right like a loonite or whatever you want to call it in terms of understanding what the difference is going to be with web 3 as it relates to community and so help me understand it hopefully help some of the audience hopefully i'm not the only luddite out there just like tell me a little bit more about what that means like why why does web3 matter for community i think what web 3 does is it just supercharges web 2 communities so look at facebook groups like there's over a billion active users on facebook groups think of like um moms in miami think about you know soccer team in uh in brooklyn there's just millions of these groups and i think what's lacking in some of these groups is ownership like the these groups and these leadership groups and community organizers often don't own the group they're uh renting the group from facebook they're renting the group from discord and i think what web 3 unlocks is just a supercharging of web 2 communities we've seen especially through the pandemic how important communities and digital communities are and into you know people's lives and i think what you're gonna see over the next five ten years is when you insert a token if you insert you know a jpeg a video an nft and you allow people to share upside in the group and allow to you know and allow them to vote on where this group could go that's when magic's really gonna happen so go a little deeper on this with me to help me understand so in web 2 a community say it existed on facebook groups wherever it was um in that ecosystem if i'm in this group say i'm in the miami mom's facebook group and i'm a miami mom imagine um and in that ecosystem i am the creator of all the content me and the other 50 moms that are in this miami moms group are the creators of all the content but we're just like work we're we are creating value by creating within this thing we're getting hopefully some value from being a part of this community but the reality is that facebook is capturing most of the value of that from our presence on the platform if facebook shuts us down for whatever reason because we're organizing something they can do that we're not really participating in the value that's being created there so is the whole premise here as you talk about web3 basically that suddenly now we actually own that platform and we have shared ownership and we also have shared skin in the game of wanting to see it expand so now i have an incentive to bring in the most amazing other moms that i know because they're going to create a bunch more value that's going to make the value of this community we're building more impactful yeah so let's talk about the main problems of the miami mom group so the first is if you're the admin and you're the community man if you're the admin you're basically the community manager that's a often very time intensive job that you're often not seeing any financial upside for so when there's ads on the side of that facebook group you're not seeing any money from that that's facebook taking that that's facebook taking that money so i would argue that a lot of the groups on let's say facebook are unsustainable just people doing it for the love of it and which is awesome and not everything needs to be about finances but imagine what the miami moms can do if they you know had a shared bank account that they can throw events for let's say so that's one problem the other problem is if you're a member of the group there's no real easy way to vote on the direction of where the group could go so for example maybe the miami moms group wants to the admin decides to expand it with miami fort lauderdale group sorry the fort lauderdale mom's group and all of a sudden there's 5 000 new moms in this group and it changes the whole dynamics of of what made that group so special in the first place and it was just because the leader of the group had a friend in fort lauderdale and was doing a favor to that to that particular mom if there was a vote that everyone had a say in should we actually merge groups maybe what would have happened is that 97 percent of people didn't actually want that merge to happen so i'm excited about the you know that's what people call governance the governance of it and then the third piece which you mentioned really is the shared ownership if everyone has skin in the game you know that reduces the problem of it's really hard to build a community and there's how do you build a viral community and when you have a token or you have an nft or you have something that makes you an owner turns community members from members to co-owners all of a sudden you do get a lot of vitality so i think that i i mean most of these things i honestly just don't still really get and i stare at them and i'm like okay yeah but not really like facebook's not gonna de-platform so miami mom's group like i don't really get it in a lot of use cases the one piece that i definitely really get as you're talking about it is this idea of like shared ownership in the thing and your incentives your skin in the game to create value for the thing that you're a part of now like i i think that is a really big idea where if twit if you were if you were a member of twitter and you had skin in the game for creating amazing content on twitter because it creates it makes the community more um amazing and it's sort of like owning stock in twitter and suddenly now you're part of this little micro community where you own stock in it effectively and by contributing engaging content to that community you are enhancing the value of your stock that is like where i see some really cool in like a still in like a pie in the sky way for me because i haven't fully transitioned my mind towards it i think that's a really interesting concept where you can take these little micro communities and people suddenly have skin in the game where it's like a public company and i own liquid stock in this little public company and can now actually contribute to its value and have an incentive on a daily basis to contribute value to it growing and expanding over time that's really cool i want to speak to the point which you mentioned which is like you don't really see deep platformization as a problem and i agree with you until it becomes a problem like i've i've had a twitter account that was just a a meme page basically in a particular community that they just twitter just shut down it was just they felt that you know i don't know why they shut it down i think like i retweet we retweeted another meme that they didn't you know like or whatever but the point is like you're still rent at the end of the day you're still renting and there's a difference between renting and owning um that's a good way of putting it renting versus zoning is a great way of putting it and i agree with you like twitter announced today i think as we're recording twitter announced that they're not going to do me like you can't post pictures of someone else's likeness without their consent and it's like that's what memes are which is by the way what twitter is and it's like how are you possibly going to say that it's kind of a crazy thing and communities are built around these memes and ecosystems are built around them and so for a platform to come out and say that i don't think it's going to happen because it seems ludicrous but that's crazy that they can go and say that it's just like restricts free speech and it restricts the ability to express yourself in the way that you want to so i don't know i agree with you i think that like that makes it more clear to me of the idea of renting versus zoning and you're just renting time on this platform and they can do whatever they want if you want to control your destiny you own so we need infrastructure to actually be developed to allow people to do this easily though totally that's the key and that's honestly years ago and it's to be honest years away yeah like it's gonna it's it's gonna roll out over the next few years um like community software that allows you to own this and and also some of the large platforms maybe twitter ends up decentralizing some of what they do um but i still think we're years away so hopefully some of the capital inflows into web3 from this hype cycle that we're going through actually lead to really fundamental things being built on the ground and whether the hype cycle comes down who knows but basically all of the inflows that are coming from this actually build something lasting where people can go and take more ownership over the long run whether it's like one percent of communities now hopefully becomes a much bigger chunk we should get into it with with alexis because he is fundamental i mean he's built but he's also investing in this future meaningfully through 776 and other things he's doing and really creating a lot of the infrastructure that we're talking about that could enable the community-based future that you're talking about i can't wait to dive in with them yeah let's do it yeah i'm gonna be like just sitting in the back with the two community guys here so let's get them in and we'll dive into it perfect we've been friends for a while internet friends is it no more original i mean the funniest background i've heard that story is like one background story tell the photos which i do feel like have you seen that you know yeah the photo yes well we have a picture of the two of us we have a picture there's a picture of me and tim cook who was the one that brought me to this event yeah and you're like in the background in between the two of us and so every time like that's a couple times that's the f that's hilarious because i've posted it a couple of times and everyone's always like i spy alexis yeah because you're right between us tangentially because you worked out at a gym in florida wait eric who was my i was his first client so back in my baseball days when eric first branched out and started his training i was his first client and then they told me like oh this guy alexis big business guy he's like crushing it i was like we should really meet but we never connected and then we ran into each other at this party and that was the like context for me approaching alexis but then we became internet friends and it's like a classic story of the modern era like we've like you know gone back and forth are you meeting me and followers i'm going to get you i'm going to get you i'm going to get you soon jump in like i had like 25 30 000 followers at the time and i talked to him and he was like you're going to pass me pretty soon and i think we're like a year later now i'm getting close i am going to i am going to get him eventually i'm going to step up my twitter picture with you and buffon and alexis in the background alexa's his face is basically like who the hell is this guy wait seriously everyone was like oh we gotta apply the picture i was i was full imposter mode at that party and it was like it was the funniest thing ever um wow seriously the one thing yeah here's the picture it's very good stop it you guys don't really want to see this i was having a good cause she's definitely someone you can't see over there who i'm making is i also love the fact that tim and alexis both have uh name tags at that the same way as us because like big stars are the same as all of us none of the people no but one of the things that i've been always just amazed by you and what i want to talk to you more about is like you have consistently and i don't know how you do it maybe you're from the future you've consistently found ways to not only predict and write about but also actually put skin in the game against things that have become the future and so you mentioned you were a history major yep that's kind of an interesting thing for me because it's like was that a part of it that you feel like history repeats itself and you've been able to use that or what do you think is kind of the genesis of being able to do that uh okay admittedly a lot of it is the right place right time in a lot of really formative moments like even just being in the first batch of y combinator in 2005 that was a fluke like being in uh being at such a pivotal moment in this new wave of software development and then i think i've gotten a lot of reps seeing a lot of stuff being because then becoming a partner y combinator starting a bunch of firms and then just really ruthlessly seeking out people doing dope [ __ ] yeah and and most of the reasons like you found some of these old tweets where i'm talking about you know a whole host of things from from crypto to creatorcon whatever stuff early it's largely just because i'm listening to people smarter than me who i really respect and then trying to parse together where the dots connect and and yeah i do think i i gave the it was virtually unfortunate but i gave the commencement speech at my alma mater uva wahoo this past year and i talked about this a little bit because i do i do look let's be let's be real learning to code uh something i wish i had spent even more time on in in college than i did um there are valuable skills to be learned across stem for real like very very valuable um there is i will argue a very important role that the humanities plays and in history in particular you just gotta have to dig through a ton of content you have to read a lot you have to synthesize a lot of data that is very subjective right even primary sources are subjective every the whole story of history is like the fact that you have to synthesize a bunch of different points of view a bunch of different interpretations and try to arrive at what is the closest thing to truth in a lot of the cases and so uh i think it did prepare me well because it was four years spent having to try to parse together a bunch of different versions of history and uh and turn into a compelling story and then communicate it why combinator you just touched on that and i need to know just because it's changing why combinator at the start early days becoming a partner there what was it like going through that first program remarkably unremarkable the first batch of yc was it was an experiment so i had pitched paul graham at the end of a talk that he gave at harvard um had gone up during senior spring break uh with my co-founder and and after this talk paul and he posted online it's called how to start a startup and it was the perfect talk for us at that time because i had just decided i wasn't going to law school i knew i wanted to start a company convince my roommate to start this thing and after the talk said hey dr graham would love to get uh a cup of coffee with you it'll totally be worth you know the cover of uh cost the cost of this drink to take you out and uh and he said you really and i was like yeah look we came all the way up from virginia and he was shocked even that we had come all the way up from virginia because maybe he didn't think we had trains or planes i don't know but uh but he agreed to it we met him that night i pitched him on this idea was a different totally different startup it's called my mobile menu or for short it would let you order food from your phone without having to wait in line but this was before a smartphone so it was like text-based it was janky's hell he was really excited about it thankfully uh but would later reject us in the meantime he announces y combinator and says hey i think random college kids when given six thousand dollars per founder that's how much it was spending an entire summer just building like writing code talking to customers can one day build billion dollar businesses and that was the premise it happened perfectly because we didn't even have to decide to drop out because it was senior year at uva so we graduated went up to boston i said we had gotten rejected came back the next morning because he called and he was like look we don't like your idea but we like you two so if you change your idea we'll come we'll give you a check and uh and i was like let me think about it uh but i was just playing it cool got off the train called them back said look we'll take it twelve thousand dollars in our bank account later we had our initial funding and that first batch really was paul and jessica uh and then trevor and robert were the other two friends who were founders but not as engaged they were they were pretty engaged those first couple years but it was an experiment it was paul mostly i think just paul's money saying hey i got this wild idea and and then the the key insight they hit on though was forcing us to meet up once a week every tuesday for dinner because now you have this cohort you have this mindset of we're all on this together o5 was a weird time to start a startup no one was doing it so you felt like you finally had some people who can empathize with you and you know back then every week they'd invite a guest speaker to sort of let you hear from inside the room or the room where it happened so see what it is yeah there you go but it was just paul this is the benefit of hindsight as a 21 year old ceo first time i'm just like oh my gosh this is great i'm getting such exposure it was just paul's friends like his lawyer friend talking about how to like a term sheet and basic stuff and then like his finance friend talking about this is what venture capital is but it was so abstract so not tactical so not helpful today right it's like the founders airbnb riffing about their bit no back then was just paul's friends but bringing us together once a week helped because it kept us honest because of the peer pressure of having to talk to like justin and emmett and be like hey what do you work would you work on last week and you know when you have people who are also very motivated and sort of giving you that pressure to to get [ __ ] done it forces you to actually do the work and i mean not everyone ends up doing it but dude it was a [ __ ] show the whole thing and even the demo day i had i pitched for 20 minutes and took questions you know today these startups pitch for like 67 seconds i don't know 60 seconds no questions uh and they figured out how to scale it i think pretty impressively uh but believe me it started out janky as hell and and that's something that i think often gets lost in the myth making but the first few years of yc were very janky it was seen as i think most people were quite dismissive of it and frankly pg and jessica were not that sophisticated when it came to silicon valley vc because they were based in boston they didn't even move to san francisco until maybe a year or two later because they were splitting the batches doing winter in san francisco because the winners of boston were so rough and summer's in boston and then eventually there weren't enough investors coming out if you can believe this there were not enough investors coming out to demo day who missed out on some amazing companies uh so they moved the whole thing to sf and the rest is history what do you think i mean starting a company now is so different dude right it is right like i'm just thinking you know my founder friends even even younger founders just graduated college or in college starting companies versus what it used to be like i hate to sound like the old guy you know we're like remember you're allowed to sound like the old guy you know remember remember the good old days but i think you know i'm curious like from your perspective what what do you think has changed for the better or for the worse i think it's all almost all for the better the 2005 so the initial users of reddit were mostly us with pseudonyms but the initial real humans were a few hundred people that i'd recruited from a forum a php bb forum that i ran in college called eyes wide and it was a place to discuss politics and news and technology and and i ran this forum for fun because i just liked the idea and there's actually old there's an old clip that i dug up of me talking about it and it you can very much hear this sort of ethos of reddit in that discussion or in that video in that little monologue welcoming users to the forum but like those were the initial users just an email blast to say hey come join please and like maybe 10 of them signed up um but that was enough to sort of get things started and then a paul graham essay helped launch this a month later you know today getting those first hundred those first thousand should be table stakes like that if if you can't figure out a way to muscle in that many users there's a deeper problem with what you're trying to solve or how you're communicating it and and i think that's a great thing right product hunt exists twitter exists a social media infrastructure that did not exist in 2005 is now so robust people are so comfortable testing out an app even test flight and and early access is becoming so much more viable um basically you throw that in the sort of ubiquity and fluency that people have now with technology 2005 had to convince people that they would want to spend time posting links on the internet and talking to strangers the average person did not think you could build community at scale online let alone with pseudonyms right online dating was still a weird niche thing of like okay cupid and a couple it's like it's wild to think about so it is a great thing that now people are so much hungrier and more ready it also means uh you can get to market a lot faster and so can your competition so then the war for people's attention now is so much greater and that is where it is now much harder but i'd still take that any day over what it was in 2005 because it means founders can focus more on the stuff that i know you two care about around the community building and a lot less on on let's say even you know product or getting those first initial users a good example this is whether it's no code or just the fact that everyone has just been programming for longer right web modern web development in 2005 was weird like it was a milestone just getting the upvotes and down votes to change the score in real time on reddit because ajax and all this stuff was was new new web technology essentially and so what a 15 year old today can do is already so impressive and then when they're building on top of libraries not to mention no code like you can get that mvp up much easier and so that's why i've been pushing and i pushed it on twitter before this uh interview the minimum viable community is going to become the new standard and you're already seeing it in pfp projects you're already seeing it across crypto um i think you all are clearly building a business around this concept that is the new challenge and and the core reason for that is everyone is overwhelmed with options attention is scarce as a result and one of the best moats for that is community and and i know that because i lived it like read it for five years between i left in 2010 i came back in early you know late 14 as exec chair had almost no investment by continent asked in the product the product didn't improve for half a decade barely stayed online okay there's no business on the planet let alone in tech that should be allowed to do nothing for five years five years and grow every single year that should not be allowed that breaks every rule and the reason it broke those rules is because of community because we got just enough right that there was a self-fulfilling little flywheel of users who just cared about spending time with other random anonymous users on the internet in these communities and it not only kept the site alive it kept growing and thriving and and so as i watch everything that now unfolds under web3 i'm like i've seen that i i know this very well like the thing that drives all the success for this next wave of internet is going to start with community and and that's a big [ __ ] deal big deal well that's like to go back to y combinator and draw a parallel to this y combinator now happens on twitter and in group texts or on telegram like we i mean we originally connected you and i connected all of these things of like people pressuring you in the peer pressure of wanting to build something and move faster we hit a group chat that was all people that were trying to grow our audiences and grow our presence and it was the pressure of it of like okay i need to keep leveling up the content i'm creating continue to build that community that i'm building that's stoked at least for me the fire and also drove me to want to think about okay what am i actually trying to build what's the equity that i'm trying to build in something not just like numbers and continuing to be performative and so i think it's really interesting because you think about like completely taking and completely blowing up this old centralized infrastructure that existed around building businesses yeah and that's what web3 promises is that we all of a sudden have new sets of infrastructure completely decentralized that open up the opportunity playing field for anybody a kid on the streets in india that now because of geo and everything they did is now online and able to grow up at digitally native can go and build something go become an artist go do whatever they want to do build a company in the exact same way that a kid that grew up going to country clubs in greenwich connecticut did yeah and and the the cheat codes of it they're not obliterated but they are getting challenged those institutions are being eroded rapidly and and it's wild to see because it's gonna mean more innovation it's gonna mean i think this feeling of like oh [ __ ] these things keep moving faster and faster it's not gonna go away at all we'll get better tools to manage it and we'll start to care more about the specific communities that we care about so we're actually going to recede i think more into those sort of new tribes those new communities those new bubbles um i have all kinds of thoughts on the impacts that this is going to have on society but uh on the whole being an entrepreneur right now it could not be a better time 16 years doing this thing i'm very happy to be clear to my investors i'm doing 776 the rest of my life don't worry this is it this is this is my startup but uh there's never been a better time to be a startup founder ceo i just remembered i i tweeted about y combinator about a year ago i'm curious your your reaction to hit me i said what would yc look like if it was created today if yc was created today it would be remote first a tokenized community for founder support partnered with creators cohort based courses for learning dao beautiful spaces all over the world to collaborate and actually pg responded too he actually trolled me a little bit what did he say you got to read it you got to read it what did he say and i kind of i kind of chirped him back too but i'm just having fun on the internet he responded it sounds like a dis and in in his defense it was a year ago daos was like no one was talking about dao is a year ago sure living in the future bro yeah i learned from the best uh it sounds like a description of how a big company or government would quote unquote improve yc in the process of attempting to reproduce it interesting and then i wrote nothing screams big government or big company like a tokenized community good point there is there is a lot of tribalism around well i see i'm completely outside this ecosystem totally like a couple of my close friends started this thing hyper which is like yeah you know and i'm just oh you're friends with josh yeah i mean i'm involved i'm an old people i think it's amazing i think it's very cool and i'm also very pro entrepreneurs having more options to do all these things i don't think it has to be one or the other but those guys got a lot of crap from the yc community for starting that thing because it was very explicitly trying to create a yc of the future in a different angle on it and so there is a lot of tribalism around it and there's a lot of defense i'm a i like paul graham on twitter i think he says a lot of interesting things a lot of my frameworks that i've come up with or written about have been pg derived could i get a glass with some uh for some tequila absolutely i'm gonna need some tequila yeah some ice please yeah a little bit the show tech tribalism oh that's i mean it's a real thing look again you're talking to the guy who made reddit like i am i i believe firsthand in all the strengths and all the weaknesses that this entails in short right as a species tribalism kept us alive for a very long time um we only our species only really got to understand it at scale with a one-way lens for the last 50 years of mass communication and and and travel and all the things that kind of gave us one view into like building tribe or understanding someone else's perspective ice is in the uh take it neat i think it's in the sink yeah just get some ice here and so they've only understood that one way right and so now we as a species are gonna have to adapt to a situation where we will feel a sense of bond that i would argue is even stronger than we had over the campfire because when we're all hanging out the campfire the next day a couple of us are gonna go hunt someone else is gonna go get some gathering berries i don't know like you're actually not connected 24 7. but now we have a sense of the intimacy of being around the campfire that never ends it is a 24 7 campfire of people who again for hundreds of thousands of years our species was really stuck to basically family and like trusted circles so we had things that bonded us but we didn't all love the same video game or the same movie or the same sports team or all the other modern creations we now have to build tribes but now we can actually curate that tribe around the campfire for exactly how we're feeling if we're thinking if we're feeling rock and roll we can go talk to our metallica fan community or if we want to dive you can go to the plethora of examples that is radical and amazing it also means that uh tribes we wouldn't normally have interacted with or come to terms with are now just as prevalent and accessible as the ones that we love and how we deal with that both the good and the bad of it is what's going to determine thank you how the hell this all turns out wow and so i'm just looking at where thank you i'm looking at how much yc has evolved and i think okay there is a strong tribe there but none of these cheers are none of these are forever and if you even look at the early yc you know again these things i really believe so many companies are are an echo of their founders pg uh very smart guy did not understand the sort of marketing brand storytelling side of business they still obviously were very successful didn't matter but you know i had i mean i'll never forget the the biggest disagreements that i had with pg and i mean i really respect him this was our main investor i'll never forget he wrote uh i had an early draft of even before i had named reddit i had drawn snoo and he said you need to get rid of that bug thing it looks like a joke it makes your company look like a joke get rid of it and i see they don't understand like this is the mascot people are going to be able to sort of imbue their own personalities on snoo we'll be able to customize it in the future snoo will feel like everyone will get to feel like they're a part of this bigger community i remember he was just like get rid of it like put it if you insist on keeping it i still have this i wrote this email my post it seem on my book if you insist on keeping it put it at the bottom of the website so it looks like a joke told me the name reddit was like poison for potential investors um said the name rhett so i came up with redditer because i was like oh these are editors on reddit said it was the dumbest thing he had ever heard like i there were times when even like i i missed my my own co-founder and and the yc batch i just felt like a little alien because i'd be advocating for stuff like this and community building and like no i think people will call themselves redditors one day if we just if we say it we can invent it if we own it and make this a hospitable place they'll feel this sense of identity they'll want to create their own snooze um the first revenue reddit made was merch again that was that was actually the first fight we had had as founders um and i said no we're absolutely doing it and i you know we i ordered like 400 shirts uh that were sitting in the bedroom had to hack together a storefront because there was no shopify there was no stripe so paypal and like a janky check out for sizes got a couple friends to take photos of the photos with the shirts we sold out in 24 hours i hand wrote thank you notes to every single person who bought one of those first edition shirts dragged them down in garbage bags to the post office mailed them out the next day the that was 05 community building and and people even though it was a brand new website no one knew anyone's real name no one they just knew we were a couple of dudes in an apartment they wanted to support they wanted to give us space on their torso to advertise us like that's amazing right that is a gift that is a blessing and i'm talking about this stuff at yc and people look at me like dude you were crazy like why don't you just go back to writing some code and just like calm down you're going to kill the company and so i think the things you're talking about here the ideals of web 3 and the ethos of being bottom up and community-led are just not a part of the ycdna will yc still be successful for the next 10 years yes i think as they expand the sectors and geographies yc i think globally is one of the most no-brainer investments you can make in early stage investing if you just invested in an index fund of all of the non-us all the global companies that get into yc i think you'll do phenomenally well because it is a magnet for top top top talent now in five years maybe sooner with crypto maybe things change right this world is shifting rapidly but now that i hear you describe this idea i really want to i want to do it uh the part that's most interesting that i so for years yc founders hacked together sort of an equity swap not all of them would but they would on their own say okay look let's let's all swap equity in each other's companies so now we have a stake in what we're doing and any time your users are hacking together a solution it's a really good sign that if you just actually provide it they will be really excited and so bringing those token economics to a batch feels feels powerful it feels kind of obvious the state two stanford business school guys they originally did it with pro athletes it was like baseball players you put them into it it's really good como tequila shout out joe joe marchese wait are they a sponsor huh uh de facto sponsor i suppose joe is a close friend that's really good it's so good joe why is that so smooth yeah i'm looking at joe this is just it's amazing it's amazing we'll hook you up with a few bottles um so uh pando they originally did it to pool ownership of future earnings with your fellow cohort for baseball players because minor league like it's such a hit driven thing but the original they tried to expand it into startup founders i think it's a really interesting idea but they're not web 3. it's still very web but it's a very cool way to do it would be a tokenized version of it yeah i would almost i'm you know we're just workshopping this live but i think like i love your your concept of mvc minimal viable community and if we just like if that was the program which is like build an mvc mvc step one step two it's like i also love the idea like if you can sell merch if you can sell out of merch in 24 hours you're on to something um so it's like these kind of like community metrics like that yeah as like kpis and dude here's the thing right so nfts everyone obviously is like very excited to talk about nfts right now three years ago you know starting to invest in companies you mentioned sky weaver about bringing nft gaming and and that felt very obvious as a gamer because like yeah you should own the [ __ ] that you spend money on i i played a lot of everquest in world of warcraft and that all felt very obvious but it wasn't until last year with the profile pics once you know i bought a bunch of crypto punks that looked like my wife is a nice investment um but then around april may whenever the apes started when i bought in it felt like there was something different happening because of the conversation and community around it and then as i started to watch this community play out i realized holy [ __ ] like not only did they pull off the mvc around uh you know art and vibes but these nfts these profile pics are in a way a kind of merch because with with way more upside right so the first 400 or however many people bought those reddit shirts now i still have mine just for you know sense mentality if any of them still have it maybe maybe you could make a few bucks off of it on ebay right but you didn't actually benefit from the upside when you bought that shirt it was entirely community driven and to support the creators but today you buy that shirt that merch when it's an nft that is an asset that actually can appreciate in value you're really getting it's not a security you're not a security but you're getting the upside of the potential growth and so now you're even more incentivized to recruit people to the tribe you're even more incentivized to identify as one of these and so then you play this out and you're like okay we'll wait so yeah 2005 i walked around and my identity was the clothing i wore 2021. um even if you're not in the metaverse you know everyone has been trained now to understand a profile pic and that that was another thing i took for granted so 2005 i deliberately did not have a profile pic in the designs for reddit simply because we had usernames we felt like that was good enough i did want to put snoo in took took a little longer than i would have liked but um it was important not to have people upload photos because facebook at the time was so strident about a real photo real name policy and so it was easy to be the exact opposite just say no [ __ ] it you can have a username whatever you want and don't use a photo but over the next 15 years as everyone was building social networking sites social media sites whatever you call it 99.9 of our attention and product was towards everything other than the profile pic because that was so ubiquitous it was an afterthought you're building a social network of course let people upload an image you can't play xbox or playstation without having a profile like your netflix account has a pro it is such an afterthought to account creation that i realized only after apes started moving that this is it makes sense this is the first place to really take hold for again this minimum viable community idea because yeah your most basic the atomic most basic atomic unit of identity online is your profile picture everyone's grandma has one chosen and and has some opinion about about it and in the same way that a bunch of redditors in o5 were excited to buy some merch people are excited about the potential of these communities based on nothing more than an image and the potential for what it could unlock for them and i i love this idea maybe we're workshopping some live thing that we should actually do because i am such a true believer here and and i can think of you know a few other people who understand this as deeply as y'all do this all this stuff that's the man this stuff has never seemed nothing i've done in tech has seemed as obvious as what is happening right now and that's the part that scares me a little bit yeah because it shouldn't feel this is the [ __ ] we learn about as kids uh and you think of oh there are all these really formative moments right in in history whether it's technology or society and you kind of think it would be nice to be a part of that like i wonder what it had been like to have been there for those times but we're actually i really i really do believe and i wasn't talking this way until like a year and a half ago i really believe we're in the midst of that right now and that's a wild feeling i was flying to new york um a couple a month or two ago and in front of me were these two people wearing board a hoodies and from a distance i saw them kind of come together and just like hug and i was like oh these must be like they must be like brothers and i went to the bathroom and i and i was like oh like i started i was like oh nice hoodie i was like are you guys friends or you guys going to something and they and they were out there like no we we literally i just saw that he was wearing a board a putty yes and i just like gave him a hug we're all going to make it man we're all going to make it that so here's what's special that would not have happened at a reddit meetup okay that that is what you're talking about is a very special encounter and i think the reason ownership matters so much is because what you're talking about now is we are all in this together and the more that you and i believe the more value it actually creates for us like value that we can buy a house with right cash money value and i keep coming back to this as an idea because if we know it works without value assigned like beyond the merch um you know i borrowed from video games to think through like leaderboards on reddit or even the awards the awards i ripped off from goldeneye if you remember at the end of the goldmine matches you'd have these awards and you didn't always know what they were for like most cowardly and but they were they were helpful because even if you lost right there's four people playing only one of you can be the winner but the other three get something to feel good about or maybe feel bad about but start a conversation so i'm like okay we need awards on reddit every day because now the after maybe three months the leaderboards like if you were a top redditor you were posting every day trying to be the top that day that week all time and so eventually you know the first couple people hit a hundred thousand two hundred thousand karma points a new user shows up and says i'm never gonna get to two hundred thousand it's not worth it there's no incentive enter daily awards and these little badges became really special they still these trophies for like best comment of the day or n year club become a status symbol again in a community where it's purely just for the vibes and it feels good and i meet people to this day who don't introduce they don't introduce themselves with their government name they don't use their reddit username they say i'm a 12 year editor i'm a 14 year editor and batch became a status symbol right and it tran it even transfers offline but all of that is not real like there are no real points there's no real ownership and so when some board ape owners see one another in the wild and know that they are in it together and they see another sale that increases the floor price they actually know that the value of the thing that they own has gone up as a result that is powerful dude and it's it's not just axi infinity in the philippines it's not just like oh hey there are a lot of people in the developing world who are making more money playing a game than they would in their jobs like this this is going to affect and radically change every layer of society and i there is not a precedent for it it looks weird to the average person is someone who does not someone watching this who doesn't understand internet communities is going to be like why in the hell would someone if i if i saw a fan the closest parallel is like a fan of your favorite sports team all right and you saw uh i gave up on the washing you saw an angel city fan uh i wouldn't i wouldn't hug them i mean i'm an owner in the team shout out to kristen stafford one of my classmates let's go i mean we could not have done better with the first first pickup um but like i wouldn't even if i saw someone in the wild wearing i mean i would say something to them like thank you for repping the team i wouldn't give them a hug right i wouldn't feel that close i mean that's that's a boundary right but you're seeing this emerge now among these communities because it's it's changing lives and here's what gets wild okay so i go through this thought exercise what would it take someone not okay like i have different economic incentives i'm never gonna why would i sell a crypto punk to look for my wife like i have no economic incentive to ever do that but someone who owns one of these apes and where this is quickly become maybe one of the most valuable assets they own today they don't want to miss out on the community it creates they don't want to miss out on the utility that it's starting to have like access to parties different things like that that's all still like that's sort of loss of version they don't want to lose that but in the not too distant future let's say they want to go buy a house and get a down payment borrow money against that ape they'll be able to do that there's an entire financial services ecosystem that's going to be built as derivatives of the value especially as stability forms i mean there should be an index fund of nfts where i can take an s p 500 of nfts yeah it literally just tracks the floor of the top 500 projects and i can go buy that because i don't have time to go focus on the million different things and understand rarity and all the different stuff but i know i want to participate in this ecosystem this building i should be able to go do that yes and and that will happen we are i backed a company called alt doing this around trading cards and other like physical alternative assets we're already letting people borrow tens of millions of dollars against their collections of trading cards that are vaulted so we have ownership we believe our pricing our valuing is is best in class we know the value of these assets and we can let them borrow money against it now here's what's wild right wealthy spoiler okay and i didn't learn this until pretty recently i i did not learn how to i wish no one knows what you're gonna say no one gave me a book when when i sold reddit i became a multi-millionaire which was earth shattering like it was a revelation right no one gave me a book that was like okay you're rich now here's how rich people do stuff that normal people don't know about yeah they're just talking about those because you know this this was more money than my parents made their entire they were ever going to make their entire working lives and it's not like they could be like all right son let me tell you what to do there was no blueprint right so i mean i learned this [ __ ] as i go and i keep going down the rabbit hole and i'm like man this is this is ridiculous so to answer your question or to actually get to the point i only learned after accumulating some wealth that if you have a portfolio of valuable stocks you can borrow against that portfolio of stocks so that the money you use to live your life can come on especially these days really low interest rates and you never pay taxes and you never pay taxes because you never have to sell so you're incentivized to hotel to hold these assets and it works because people believe in the stock market people believe i mean it's easy to sell and and they believe that it's valued reasonably accurately because the market has so much liquidity okay but that is just a byproduct of the first mover advantage of the stock market having been around for a while and people trusting it my i will argue my my very high caliber serena williams uh trading card collection is very valuable asset gonna appreciate over time um and that collection has value if it were art like traditional art like a bunch of picassos i could probably borrow against it take a little bit more work but i could still do it but you have all of these new assets that have just showed up that are really valuable that have way more incentives to hodl like yeah if i have a picasso i want to keep it up because it's a nice flex when people come over but i don't get any utility from that picasso not like i get from a board eight so here is what no one is prepared for it is inevitable and on the order of of months and lots of years if not months um for all those board ape owners to never have to actually sell so if you're already incentivized to hotel for all the reasons we talked about and now financially you don't have to do it why would you and so if that's gonna happen what happens to the price like the and this is wild because i know stocks don't only go up zoom out and they do but fair fair and now i'm looking at this and i'm going okay we're breaking the models for how these financial systems work and we're on a very and i'm i i want to be a little cautionary here like i still i believe in business cycles as a concept i'm not saying this just breaks the whole game but i'm looking at enough examples of things that really do not apply do not have any precedent yeah dogecoin still has a 30 billion market cap it is literally worth it's a joke cryptocurrency invented on reddit to make fun of bitcoin but it has enough value i think about it as um it's gartner hype cycles right like we've all talked about that we've seen it on twitter it's all over the place like you have these hype cycles but the cool thing about with web 3 and with crypto with it is the hype cycle actually drives the future growth and value of the ecosystem because the hype cycle drives a bunch of greed which pulls a bunch of capital flows into it all the vcs are like you know they took creator economy and like threw it on the ground and now web 3's in every vc's bio i and it's like all this money flows into the space there will be a pullback at some point inevitably because that's how these things go but that money is now being deployed towards building something in the future it's not just like cashing out whatever there are people now that during that darker period that's going to come are going to be building whatever the next wave is and the same people that after the crash in late 2017 early 2018 were still building in the darkness of 2018 those are the people who are now profiting mightily in 2021 and no one wants to talk about that it's not like this overnight success no actually infinity was being built in the dark they were grinding in the dark we have jihao coming in actually super stoked for that right and that's it's such a that is such a perfect example right all of these success stories you're seeing now so rare grinding in the dark for years uh there's another company that i'd back i haven't announced yet uh well that's fine coin tracker okay which is about as unsexy as you could get taxes right yeah i love great but like such an indispensable business and for years just said like okay we're going to build this because we believe long term in the value of this asset class when you all see the announcement about their fundraise they'll be like well played but but well-earned because they grinded for years when no one cared and when we did that seed round i i actually had a couple lps ask like you're really sure it's a good time to be investing in crypto and it's like yeah no it's the best time to be investing because the the serious builders who are building right now are building for the next it's a good transition to talking about 776 actually because that was something i wanted to ask you about which is as a builder and now it applies to you as an investor the idea of variant perception you have a variant perception of what the future looks like you get paid when you're proven right for what that variant perception looks like toby at shopify had a very perception of the future all the e-commerce so he built a product that would exist in our future it kind of seemed crazy at the time 10 years later he seems like an absolute genius because he was and you did that as a builder you were community first with reddit you did everything you did there now you're trying to do the same thing with 776. you're building a different venture capital ecosystem something that is fundamentally different it seems like than what most vcs have been doing can you talk about that what your vision is for it and where you're headed i am glad you think that i still feel like we're a year in so i'm trying to keep perspective here to be like all right look we still haven't done anything yet but the the foundational work was first and foremost taking all the experience i have designing product and marrying that with a deep understanding of community but also broadly you know people and culture and that's something my partner caitlin who we had hired loretta had like 50 people no one wanted to work there and she became our vp people and culture took us to like 600 700 people and the reason for that is ventures somehow all these vcs we all talk about investing in startups disrupting antiquated industries using software that's what we love investing we do that all day long yet most venture capital firms are run devoid of software there there is no one has looked inward and said hey wait shouldn't we be thinking about ourselves as something that needs to get disrupted and as a software builder i can just think okay well let me think of all the things that we do that constitute work as a venture capitalist build software so that we have literally an operating system we call it cerebro because we're really into the x-men that makes the work we do collaboratively as a team but also with our founders way more efficient so like don't ask me hey do you know someone at shopify that is a waste of my time as a human human brain is not good at that query a database is great at that query so instead every founder gets to log in anytime they want to and run that search amount i think of 44 000 contacts right now that's dope and just type in shopify or or type in whoever or type in whatever characters can actually see the not only all the people that we're connected to and the depth of the bios but then with one click get an intro that intro gets routed to the partner at the firm who has the best relationship with that person and that's because after you know in every meeting those notes tag individuals and companies so that data stays forever in cereal no no one human should think like hey uh when was the last time i met with so and so i'll do the intro or some other partners like no no i met with her last week i'll do the intro no it's a waste of time and so when i think of the entire job of venture capital it is a people sort of network driven business and so how do we spend as much time as possible getting our people spending their time doing the things that humans are great at and letting software do everything else and i think it does dovetail into wherever this thing is going because i keep seeing more and more people in rounds that i i mean we're i i love leading rounds i want to be that high conviction investor that i dreamt of as a ceo as a first timer like who just says i'll do the whole round i don't care like i don't i don't want to know who else you're talking to i don't want to know who else is involved i don't give a [ __ ] i make up my own decisions leading this round but in the last three years in particular more and more folks have shown up on cap tables where it's like oh hey i've got you know 50k from blah blah blah 100k from blah blah blah i'm like okay they're real like they do [ __ ] they will actually be valuable whether they have operational expertise or like distribution expertise or ideally both and that framework is where i see this this model keep keep going because look the world is a washing capital right now especially as we move into more and more token-based companies and the best founders with the best companies are going to have their pick and so as a venture capitalist i think the onus is now on us to prove why we are exceptional why we're differentiated to be building actually with software and then be prepared for the fact that this is going to be a much more collaborative effort right like i don't even if you look at i don't know some stuff i can't announce yet but the the not only will vcs have to get comfortable having other folks on the cap table who are let's say individual investors they'll have to get comfortable with like a bunch of random strangers on the internet who have just bought into the token yeah who are totally synonymous exactly and again i just feel like i feel like bane in batman when he's like uh you merely adopted the darkness batman i was born in it molded by that's pretty good that but that is that is how i feel because i feel like i've been born in this darkness like that this is what this is this is what made reddit work the idea that i mean i i've i've funded companies where the founders met on reddit in in dms just going back and forth with one another um that's literally what we're trying to do by the way with what we're building here is like a community where we talk about an idea in here someone in the community might want to go start that and we can go fend that we can go form a dow to go build something with people in the community and go actually execute against it and i think that is so powerful and it's so lacking in what we're currently seeing and what's wild is all of the the precedent for it exists and again i i know you're a student of reddit so you know this especially greg but like we have seen versions of this play out before in the internet in the social internet for the last 15 years like my my favorite first example was just in 08 when reddit pull bombed uh greenpeace for mr splashy pants and that was just purely hey let's all troll this thing so that the funny name wins but over time in the last decade we've seen everything from i mean communities trying to pull well successfully pooling money together for philanthropic efforts hundreds of thousands of dollars raised for donors choose just to get stephen colbert's attention in like 2010. right we've seen examples of this but they're using they're using off-the-shelf tools they're kind of hacking it together it's it's the perfect example of people finding that way to just make it work because the best tools weren't available and in many ways i think reddit will be looked at as a kind of proof of concept for a lot of the stuff that web3 is just gonna run away with in the next few years we're gonna form a dow to take a twitter board seat we were just whipping before just to make sure to go fix twitter what would you want to do to fix twitter oh so many things king of twitter what would you do so many things what would i do to fix twitter um okay let's actually go through it i would um first off like probably bring in a bunch of new product people who would radically hasten the pace of new product testing and delivery so that you could actually drive more signal through the platform because right now like their ad platform sucks because there's no signal being drawn out of the whole thing forget that forget about care about products the stock is gonna be two hundred dollars just drive more direct response if i was a pm at twitter i've spoken to kvon about this okay um first of all messaging the messaging product yeah pretty broken it's pretty broken yeah like even if we look at it a lot too yeah in spite of the fact like our entire relationship yeah twitter exactly exactly so like it's true if we think about you know even like the web 3 ecosystem [Music] twitter owns broadcast right so you broadcast out and you try to attract people and you bring them into discord where you have these intimate conversations yeah what if twitter owned that whole stack and used messaging to expand upon that so fixed messaging expand into intimacy yeah is really interesting yeah all right it should be where twitter should exist as the central point for all like knowledge creators information creators if you're not a visual creator where like tick tock snap could be your center point twitter should be that you should be able to take everything from massive discovery of like viral content threads things you're doing drive down to more monetizable streams like review super follows ticketed spaces you should be able to take to messaging for more like group chat and intimate messaging i mean it should all exist there and you should be able to do it as a super app and they haven't been able to execute against that vision i love i look i agree with the things you're saying i love how unsympathetic you are to their large companies i look at twitter and i still say like wow they actually ship and try new products compared to their peers i agree i mean i went on cnbc last week and literally said that where they were like asking me about this uh walmart uh live stream that they did this past weekend they did like a shopping live stream with jason derulo and it was this big deal and they were like oh it seems kind of stupid and my whole point was at least for the first time in 10 years they're doing something they're shipping new product they're trying things they rolled out blue they rolled out some new things and so they're actually showing some willingness to do things it's just the pace of it is still so slow relative to it startup and this is why i [ __ ] love this job because that word or that phrase hopefully has never come out of my mouth which is like well what if twitter does this or what if google does this or whatever because the there is nothing that can compete with a focused relentless team building to solve a specific problem that's not being addressed by an incumbent like they're just i would never bet against that and as like as successful as those incumbents have been at a certain point you just get good at like one or maybe two things and then all the bureaucracy all the everything fills up around it's still a great business potentially but the reason this industry is so amazing is that a new entrant can show up with something 10x better and win market share really quickly and that's before crypto that's before the earliest adopters have an economic incentive to bring more people on so if it worked before but man it's going to work now yeah this is like the clay christensen model of disruption like you go in and provide the best solution for that niche sub segment and you just use that to go like just penetrate the entire space and if you can build if you can build the community yeah and and that is that is i think the greatest blind spot that exists right now among the incumbents whether it's yc or others that discipline does not exist and it didn't it's not again it's not their fault it's just that skill set has now gotten really really [ __ ] valuable and a lot of the other historical ones um whether it's around product or you know sort of traditional growth marketing drivers all that stuff again they're not commoditized entirely but they're sort of table stakes you need to have those skills you need to have that discipline you need to find that expertise uh this i'm telling you this minimum viable community thing is a thing it's a thing i like that you all are thinking this way so i know we're running up against the end of time i need to hit you with not a lightning round but like you live in the future okay what's your he was he it's first of all this history i didn't know your background was in history history major history major research but just before you get into that do you still are you still like a history buff uh no just a future buff now i mean i i i mean i love a good documentary but i don't i don't spend nearly enough time reading do you read books most of the things i read yes but most of the things i read are just like non-fiction geared towards i mean it's business a lot of business books the last great book i read uh it was like a few months ago now i've lost all track of time because of web three hot hand oh yeah great one yeah but it's fun it's like it's you gotta read there's a little you read sci-fi i should i project hail mary phenomenal if anyone else is so good um sci-fi plays a very important role might i add yeah uh so i actually into the future all right but the um the whole idea of just like my hot take on reading and consumption in general goes back to a lot of things we've been talking about which is like our as content has increased and there's been just like a ubiquity of content attention spans have gone like this and so like what i channeled into honestly when i was building twitter and i was writing and trying to build this community was that exact fact people don't have time to go read a 10 000 word article so i'm gonna deliver the like most dilute like just super concentrated value in a very short little that's why i told you and that's why you can skip because if you can do that i think it's really valuable someone in five minutes or two minutes can leave feeling much smarter they didn't have time to go do the long form thing so okay so i should say then when i read read books i'm listening to the audiobook on audible usually at one on one on netflix this is the thing people aren't reading books they're using their own audiobooks and they're great the experience is great if they're read by a good person i've heard the new will smith book is awesome and it's read by him and it's supposed to be awesome it's not the same though i do audiobooks too but it's like you know what's the equivalent of it's like i prefer eating in a restaurant and and and like that's fair versus delivery although delivery's so convenient yeah it's there's still god there was just a what the hell was the book that i just ordered on amazon oh it's the 60-19 project okay so i'm doing a little bit of history i order every now and then i get a book that's like hardcover because i'm going to make an effort to read this thing because i feel like i want it's a meal i want to enjoy in the restaurant 80 of the books that i read i'm listening to while walking my dog yep what three books would you make mandatory for your daughter to read as she grows up whoa oh someone asked me this recently i didn't know you were going there this is like a great question someone asked me this exact question so i'll give you i'll give you my my three while you're thinking all right um uh when breath becomes air has been one of the most impactful books in my life it's about stanford neurosurgeon resident who gets diagnosed with lung cancer terminal lung cancer and he finds out he has a few months to live and how he rationalizes an entire life spent building to the future and then the future is taken away from you and it's true and he's writing this book and he has an unborn daughter it's terribly sad and the woman next to me on the plane as i was reading it had to ask if i was okay because i was like sobbing on a plane reading it but one of the most impactful books of my life so that's one man's search for meaning incredible uh frankel uh survived auschwitz wrote the book while there and i don't mean to get like super happy with all this stuff but hugely hugely impactful um i need to think about what the third is maybe something a little more positive that's hard to follow man yeah i think okay um i just like i i always find it interesting like when you think about raising a kid i'm having my first child soon i know but you also have a baby you also you also i mean i appreciate that there's lessons in there i would also i don't know i i'm such a positive poly kind of vibe like i'm just like i don't know i feel like something positive but knowing your mortality i personally like memento mori the stoic philosophy of like knowing your death in order to live your life i think personally i find death to be one of the most motivating the like inevitability of death to be one of the most motivating things in my life i it's funny so i i would definitely class myself as a positive person as a high school kid i had a thing because you know high school kids do this stuff on my wall that was uh lives remaining zero uh because it's like old school video games before they were easy which they are now like you'd have a limited number of lives and then when you're on your last life i always felt like i played better because i knew like okay it's the last one back against the wall and i had i had that on my wall as an angsty high school kid and it's something it's a thing that i come back to over and over again so i i vibe with the stoicism of it for i mean i have a four-year-old so we're just trying to work on sight words right now but uh when i think of books that had a huge huge impact on me um the uh last sort of in the vein of um the breath book which i need to read because i should read it it's short the final speech final uh by randy pouch yeah butchering the name that that is something i actually feel like i should revisit now that we're having this conversation um because along the same lines of like okay what is at the end of the day life well lived what's the what are the things that are going to matter to you yeah when do you get that sentence and from 8-1 0-1 is amazing peter peter has a lot of things right in that book and and i think although he didn't i guess it was he didn't write about yourself it was just his lecture um the from a from a business standpoint or a okay from uh i want you to be aware of the world standpoint uh influence by um god it's been around forever it's basically the like the shorthand for how marketers manipulate your mind and and it's a great book that i revisit every few years just to understand and re-remind myself how i'm being like [ __ ] with um because at the end of the day like all of these things matter so much it's not just like don't think just dom draper it's it's all the even subtle decisions that are made uh even around your favorite web3 project that are giving you some sense of i need to be a part of this uh that i think drives more of our decision making than most of us would like to emit especially folks who are maybe overeducated would like to admit i love hearing folks who are like i'm not motivated by brands i don't believe in brands i'm like [ __ ] you absolutely are i just saw you pull out your iphone and where you're all birds get out of here you're thinking of gucci and versace but no no everyone is making even even the profile pic you chose is you being influenced by branding or or the design of it or the the instagram photo you just posted like we're all all influenced by it um and then gosh okay the other one that comes to mind which is not a book i'd recommend necessarily but like the one that i think about a lot um because i didn't for like 15 16 years of my life is um science of sleep oh so good why we sleep why we sleep thank you matthew uh yeah i took his class at stanford actually amazing class i blew my mind too i that that's the other one that during covid i i ended up reflecting on a ton because i think like a lot of people was like doing an inventory of myself and realized like if i'm really thinking about longevity here i'm not not team baby blood so i want to do it the old-fashioned way um turns out sleeping yep actually one of the best ways to do that so eight sleep is a sponsor of this show actually i'm a huge eight sleeper here we go shout out to matteo uh he's been a game changer for my sleep as well but yeah why we sleep was amazing he's he has an amazing podcast that he just did with um hubermann on hubermann lab that was phenomenal where he goes deep on that stuff if i were him i would end every podcast with like a soothing uh sort of outro where you can sleep yeah so good well i know we've taken what was the lightning round yeah like oh okay no i actually do want to hit that now you're reminding me i know we're getting up against you and i'm lightning round you might as well be a producer give me your give me yeah you can be an investor in it if you want we'll bring you in wow that's after it we're going to pitch you on this afternoon we're going to pick yeah we're going to do tokens we're going to pitch them on and after uh that's going to be off screen um lightning round you live in the future give me one to three things that are your predictions for where we're gonna be in the future well how future you define like five years about five years um i think everyone in five years will participate in a dow they won't know it necessarily i don't think that branding is is whack um but they it won't get right user experience triumphs over everything so yeah i think it will be pretty commonplace not maybe not everyone but like for all intents and purposes it'll be a pretty normal thing for people to participate in dao's um five years uh people will in five years agree with the statement that a famous vc asked me like 10 years ago what's something that you believe that the rest of the world where and uh and i told them that people will care more or do care more and will care more about their online identity than their offline one they'll care more about some pseudonym they made up than their government name and so i think in five years that will be true uh and then give me a play to earn one oh great one okay in five years no one 90 of people will not play a game unless they are being properly valued for that time and so the idea if you're messing around you're on candy crush right now you're listening to this thing in the background i caught you you should be paying attention kev got caught and and i caught you because in five years you will actually value your time properly and instead of being harvested for advertisements or being fleeced for dollars to buy you know stupid hammers you don't actually own you will be playing some on-chain equivalent game that will be just as fun but you'll actually earn value in you will be the harvester yes yeah it says the harvesty yes and you deserve it you deserve it you've been crushing that candy for too long uh for free or you're actually getting charged for it so amazing that's good i mean i feel like those are clips that in five years yeah you could do a nice retrospective and we are we're gonna check the recipes wrong yeah wrong wrong one right but you got paid for it yeah we're gonna check the receipts on it in five years i loved it this was awesome thank you so much i'm very very excited to see what's happened down here and i'm just again i'm still like i'm still trying to be cautiously optimistic about this whole thing but guys it's this is this this very much feels like we're on the verge of something that's drastically going to change what everything stuff or what oh no one three man dude i thought he was talking he said he was trying to be cautious about it i thought he was talking i'm trying to be cautious about the fact that like like people usually you're supposed to get the like you're supposed to have the comeuppance yeah when you're really feeling you know this time it's different all the other [ __ ] and so i'm trying i'm really trying to be [Music] responsible here but it's hard because i'm watching [ __ ] happen that like feels it feels like i see the matrix right now yeah and the thing that is changing is affecting every major institution we know totally and the fact that it's changing the one that drives like wealth creation is the the game changer because everyone needs to [ __ ] pay their rent at the end of the day and yeah yeah we're we're working with like so many major brands like on web three mm-hmm so and everyone is calling wait for for not for this for late check out which is because we have like an agency that and it's it's crazy like everyone is trying to figure it out yeah and but now they're taking it seriously like i would say over the last like 60 to 90 days people have been like nike fortnight you know all the like the big boys are kind of like what you know you know what's our role in this future man i mean some of them just need to hang on and some of them and and some of them it's like you know the req like the recommendation is like it's not in your dna yeah i honestly don't think that you can make the leap and in which case it's like okay let's incubate our own let's just incubate our own product oh yeah no that makes a lot of sense i i really we talked about one company in particular at the start i this is this is innovator's dilemma times a hundred because it's such a different way of thinking that i i just don't think incumbents have a chance and it actually the irony is it becomes a liability to have had or to have the uh incumbency so like you saw with discord i think jason's a smart dude they're they're the de facto home of real time web 3 conversation yeah and look at the reaction yeah to a minor feature yeah like that's a liability and and and i i think they'll still navigate it okay but like holy [ __ ] like when has there been like if facebook if zuck had done the famous hey only show me mockups that are mobile because this is a mobile first company now and every or you know a loud enough cabal of users were like no desktop is everything we need we don't need mobile web or mobile apps um like that would have been a really difficult thing to navigate but thankfully users shouldn't really give a [ __ ] and okay i mean stayed ahead of the curve i don't know what you do as an incumbent if you have this kind of sort of i mean frankly baseless opposition to a thing that's as world-changing as like desktop to mobile and you know you need to make that shift and i don't think every ceo has the courage or conviction or the understanding of community yeah to know how existential the threat is yeah but they're gonna find out six months to a year totally like if you're a ceo and you're not spending 20 to 30 percent of your time in a discord server yeah you're not going to make it you're not going to make it you know oh for real yeah like you're not yeah and and the irony is some of the ceos who ostensibly should know this stuff don't yeah and and i yeah like i said i think the good news is man technology the market does not care about your feelings yeah uh people just move towards where they get value and it's gonna happen quick man so yeah i mean we fundamentally believe that podcasting is broken the traditional first off because of kovid the minimum viable product of podcasting has come way down because you can just record it on zoom and so everyone went down there and there's a bunch of cool innovation happening riverside's a really cool product are you an investor in that super cool product and like being able to it's so we were talking about this last night so are you all you i hope you're using riverside for we use riverside for all the people oh right you're in person yeah yeah yeah we're in person but for the people like we have gary v tomorrow like we use riverside for all the stuff that's remote but we basically believe that the conversations the minimum viable community of it has come so far down and so the opportunity here is give community access to this so that they can feel like they're a real part of the conversation give mike's to more people and open up all of the opportunity that comes with that and so that's what we're trying to build this this reminds me here's a little gem from the time capsule you remember when serial went viral i remember early in you know that community on reddit was like the the epicenter of all the conversation on that podcast whether the podcast wanted to admit it or not like that was what was driving all the interest all the extra content like articles were being written about the conversations from within the subreddit and i remember reaching out to the team there saying hey you all should really engage with this community like this whether you know it or not is the most valuable part of your podcast no offense and to say that they were dismissive was an understatement and and i think of the really exceptional sort of breakout podcasts that have existed whether it was sort of a limited run window like a particular season of cereal or whether it's the more mainstay ones like the joe rogans of the world you're talking about community at the end of the day that is where all of the value was was it being properly accounted for in most cases not really and i do think i mean look earliest investor in patreon i think they cracked an important part of it but did so at a time when the on-ramp was still fiat right that was just the way to do it in 2014 or whatever patreon launched and so this is an opportunity for sure i think to get that right and it doesn't even have to just be podcasts yeah i guess audio is just a it's a good gateway in gateway it doesn't have to be but the whole i mean the whole idea of like right now the revenue of this is our sponsors who we love and they're great and they respond sponsor revenue for the podcast but think about the value that could be created out of a community of 10 000 people who are all motivated around these ideas deeper in the conversation what are they going to go start what are they going to build what are we going to incubate and the fact that we can then create a community and because of web 3 we can create shared value and the value that comes out of that community that's insane and that's not hundreds of thousands or like low seven figures of value from maybe having sponsors that's like there could be tens hundreds of millions of dollars of value that come out of this community that is being built around amazing future looking ideas and just replicate that with so like yeah just create pillars to it different verticals right people with audiences yeah bring them to a community space yeah have a media asset which is basically an excuse to a ritual and then create on-chain revenue that is unchanged yeah and nfts for ticketing access to special events and you create a special channel that people have access to where we can share deal flow and syndicate things create a fund around it i mean there's like almost endless opportunities and just like what's our run rate on this show uh i mean over a million and a half probably pretty pretty much yeah anything yet if we could just do that in different verticals with an add-on chain yeah it's pretty crazy to think about the the opportunity that exists here but the coolest thing is like we haven't done anything yet and there's a community of 2000 people that are hyped and talking about talking about the things we're talking about because people love these ideas and they want to be a part of the discussion so when we release this episode and we're like we talked about a bunch of cool [ __ ] about the future let's go jam on it go deeper on it what are the cool ideas people have what can we be building around this and we can actually go support those people it's a super democratizing and empowering idea yeah and we can even build like eventually like tooling for this like just like you're building tooling for adventure yeah like why wouldn't we build yeah tooling yeah for other creators the barrier to entry is that no one wants to do the hard part of it which is so true we're here in miami we have we had to pay for all of the film crew to make it really high quality to build the community and spend the time on it like the messy part of building community is that you actually have to come early days hours i spent building out twitter commenting on things responding to people dms like full-time jobs all of that i mean it's really messy and it's like the um you know it's like the pogram like do things that don't scale early on and um that's the messy part of it and i also just think most of the people that try to do this stuff are not community native they're just what they're grounded in you know think boy stuff they're like really smart probably much smarter than we are think boy i like that but it is like the tech think boy thing but they're very smart probably much smarter than we are but we understand community yeah and that's where we're going to ground all of you reddit was built in the comments i mean countless hours i used to play a game where because i got all the contact at reddit emails for the first like five years and i would play this game where because there'd always be [ __ ] emails but just random stuff customer support stuff and i would every now and then respond but starting from the top of the inbox just so that someone like the first i know five ten people would get replies that happened within like a minute so that they would feel like superheroes like oh my god i just got a response from reddit.com from the founder like this is amazing just to create that experience even if i was just saying no we're not going to do that feature or maybe one day we'll do that feature or whatever those in the trenches stuff no one wants to do but has to happen that's how you if you're hosting the party you're the first one there you're the last one cleaning up like that's the part of the job that's not sexy but mandatory and i can tell you from years and years of doing it the roi the way that compounds is amazing it is amazing well let's talk okay all right let's cook i'm gonna go yeah you gotta go to your next event man thank you so much all right takeaways from the episode with alexis finally by the way got alexis into the room which is crazy because he hasn't left his house and compound in like two and a half years he said to do a live thing so crazy that we were the first ones that got to do that with him which is awesome yeah that was incredible what was the one big thing for you the one big takeaway i mean there was a lot i will say but i think i i was happy i got to go through that tweet that i did a year ago about the you know what would yc look like if it was invented today and despite you know his allegiance to yc and how much he loves yc he kind of was like yeah like it makes sense that you know a web 3 version of yc should exist it makes sense that it should be remote it makes sense that it should be global so um my big takeaway was you know we were i was on the right track and uh definitely something i'm gonna explore so my big takeaway is gonna be a slightly tongue-in-cheek one um but after we got done he was like hey hit me up i actually want to invest in this and so we're going to have to have a conversation with alexis about potentially investing in the future of community-based podcasts so if you're tuned in and you want to be a part of this we're going to keep building this thing to the moon you're going to love it you are going to love it the saying used to be let your game speak with common stock it's about let your gains speak i

yourself out find your phone sway i'm still trying to get it like every day humbleness is hard when you start receiving praise guards here but some words can never be taken away good morning good morning [Laughter] dude so big week we've had a lot going on we uh both in the last week became a meme we became names we became names and probably a lot of people that are listening to this or watching this saw something around this but i wanted to talk about it because i thought it was a pretty interesting case study of the new internet in this new age we live in man all right so tell me your meme story so i'm going through the airport and by the way i'm going to preface this by saying this is a true story so like i got a lot of flack for this and everyone was giving me [ __ ] saying it wasn't true i'm gonna walk you through it so i'm going through the airport i'm at john wayne airport in l.a going to going flying back home and it was like a week after i dropped that evergrand thread the thing the chinese company where you were giving me crap i'm saying i was the evergreen guy so i'm walking through the tsa checkpoint and the tsa guy is like talking about evergreen and i overhear him and my first reaction is like oh i'm gonna chime in here i'm gonna come in and say yeah oh yeah evergreen interesting story interesting situation whatever and as i'm about to do that he says yeah i read about i read about it on twitter from this guy sahil blue and i was like damn super cool life moment overheard some guy that had seen about this wait stop there best part about that is the saheel bloom i thought it was hilarious it's also how my name is like so commonly mispronounced everybody that's like the first thing that first way they pronounce it so anyway he says it i grab my bag i walk away i don't say anything about it and then i tweet it out like there's a cool life moment for me it's like an interesting thing and so i tweeted out and within 30 seconds it is becoming an internet meme and i've never experienced that but like everyone over the course of the next 24 hours is tweeting out like the exact same format tweet with their own thing trolling me and so it was basically like i'm sitting on a plane and i'm flying back and my my internet is just blowing up with people like tweeting at me most of it was like good fun some of it was not and just like people openly just being mean about it but it was kind of a wild situation like how viral did it get pretty [ __ ] viral i feel like i saw it everywhere man it was everywhere yeah i mean there were people ran and it was it was so viral that there were random people saying it not citing me as like the original source of it and then people saying like oh this is a really hilarious thing in a hilarious way and did you feel bad no because i knew it was true because people were making kind of making fun of me yeah i mean part of me was just like i know it's true so i don't feel bad and i'm just gonna wear it and like if people want to make fun of me for it it's fine but dude i just leaned into it i basically said like it's fine if you want to make me a meme i'm going to donate money with it and so like i got a bunch of new followers from it because a lot of people saw my page and like the domikong sue the nfl player who we're going to have on uh in an episode in season one like came and said he would donate money and match me on whatever so we ended up donating 10 grand to a charity associated with it like i said i would donate a dollar for every new follower i got from becoming a meme and it was kind of cool but basically i had to just lean into it because the internet is just permanent man you can't like run and hide from stuff the way you might have used to be able to where you can just say oh yeah i'm just gonna delete it walk away whatever and so i leaned into it four sigmatic is the secret sauce behind the where it happens podcast you know how much i've been talking about that hot cocoa the one that's jam-packed with the reishi mushrooms it absolutely has been transforming my mornings i have it at night completely chills me out takes out all my stress and allows me to have a good night's rest after those long days of tequila on the set i'm sure that's helpful i mean it does help the sweet vanilla plant-based protein is the one that i've been going to after my workouts in the mornings it's been a game changer 18 grams of plant-based protein adaptogens jam-packed with mushroom goodness it's been a complete game changer for me so to go check it out go to 4sigmatic.com and use code the room at checkout great why do you look so tired i look so tired because i did not sleep last night have you never slept well or is this a new thing it's not that i can't fall asleep i fall asleep like right away but i wake up a couple hours later and i'm just sitting in my bed and i look at the ceiling and i can't fall back asleep and i don't know what to do so i was literally you and for the longest time i was this like hustle culture bro sleep when i'm dead didn't want to sleep didn't care about my sleep and then i honestly i started reading more of the research and realizing how impactful sleep is to your longevity to your health all of these other things and as part of that i found eight sleep which has completely revolutionized the way i sleep i've heard of eight sleep can you tell me more about it think of it as like the future of sleep all of these mattress companies have created these mattresses they're just stuck they're stock mattresses eight sleep is technology plus sleep combined so the whole product is built around optimizing the temperature that you sleep at and so you read about sleeping cold is the key to sleeping and it's not quite true everyone has a different optimal sleep temperature and it changes throughout the night which is the crazy part about it so you might need really cold to fall asleep and then you might need it to be a little bit warmer to keep you asleep and the eight sleep actually transitions your temperature through the night to keep you at the optimal sleep sleep temperature at any point during the night it keeps you asleep it helps you fall asleep faster and i actually since i started using it have been sleeping better and feeling so much more energized during the day as a result sounds like i need a nate sleep i think everyone needs innate sleep so if you're tuning in right now and you want to try out the eight sleep to completely change the way you sleep rest recover so that you're ready to take on all of life's challenges check out eightsleep.com where it happens to get a discount on your first product here's a tip don't be like greg eisenberg be like sahil bloom went with it there's basically two things you can do right you can either lean in or delete yeah and we have a friend who yeah he would totally delete it right yeah he was panicked that whole time he was texting me being like dude what are you gonna do this is awful your brand is shot right and i don't know man i just think when you have something like that especially if you can stand behind it just lean into it so can you double click into that for a bit like why didn't you decide to delete it like we were just like it's true yeah i mean dude i don't care it was true and i didn't think the numbers were that ridiculous by the way the thread had gotten like 7 million impressions i'd gone on tv talking about it and so i had actually been around talking about it so i actually didn't think it was that low probability of an incident to occur either and so i was just like i'm just gonna stand behind it it's real it is what it is you wanna hear my meme story yeah quick i'm gonna start pouring us drinks while you do that okay while you do that i posted a thread how you know i'm just like obsessed with nfts and web3 and i'm i did this thread on why nfts are the future and the first day i i posted i'm getting so much love by all these people i respect like the top people in like the web 3 community are like just sharing it and and just talking about how it's such a good thread and i'm feeling really good i go to sleep at night the world is beautiful i wake up in the morning and i have thousands of replies and retweets and likes on one portion of the thread that is just people meaning it so i just pulled it up um [Music] 30 there's actually 3 800 quote retweets which is basically just people it's bad you wake up and it was 3 800 quote retweets and i was the tweet was most people who make fun of nfts don't own don't own nfts they've never minted i remember this yeah they haven't staked their nfts they've never earned an nft playing a game et cetera et cetera like the the basic idea was that like there's a ton of people dunking on yeah and nftv you're not in the game they're not in the game they're not in the game exactly yeah i got i got it i actually didn't understand why it got memed yeah but you did really become a meme and our friend same friend was freaking out that whole time i remember that yeah because he was so i was everywhere yeah um and i like you yeah was like what do i do i i mean it goes in it's it's only natural that it goes into your head you're like should i delete this yeah but i'm kind of like this is what i believe yeah you got to put yourself out there yeah i agree man and it's a good segue too because our guest today yeah we're going to have in has had his fair share of internet trolls and hate so he's going to have some interesting perspectives on that as well obviously we've got a little ways that we need to uh dive into before he comes in but it'll be fun to talk about with him yeah so let's get this drink going and dive right into it let's do it hudson whiskey four part harmony special edition man hudson like hudson new york hudson new york okay yeah it's a beautiful bottle i've never seen what we got i never have you had this no i haven't had it keep in mind it's nine in the morning right now so we're really committed to this whole drinking thing that's good it's sweet it's sweet right sweet it's sweet it's good so what are we talking about today i want to talk world's fair if that works for you big world's fair energy uh i'm into it i'm into it so let's talk world's fair i want to set the stage for set the stage for this a little bit um so the world's fair i first read about i'm curious where you first heard about it i first read about the world's fair in the book um devil in the white city this is the name of the book um eric larson one of my favorite authors actually it's amazing it's like narrative non-fiction is his is his archetype and devil in the white city's about really about the first serial killer in history effectively it's a true story based on a true story but it's based at the 1893 chicago world fair i think it was called the colombian exposition then but it's the world's fair and the whole thing with the world's fair is like a gathering of the entire world culturally industrially et cetera you bring people together and share all the amazing things progress that's happening i think it started in like the late 1700s i think it was in bohemia in prague they did the first one and over the course of history it's become this big way that basically countries went and flexed on whatever their progress was and so it was like you know early days you'd go and flex on some industrial progress like at the 1893 one in chicago the ferris wheel the first ferris wheel was like the massive thing people showed up and there was this enormous circle there that people didn't understand and you can imagine the first time you see a ferris wheel that's bananas right see that going you're going to get into a thing that's going around this 200-foot circle that seems ridiculous and so people would use it these countries would use it to flex on their progress and it was people and it was also countries and it was there was like a romantic aspect to it you would go and there's people from different cultures and they would do dances and it was like this amazing amazing thing and for a lot of history it was like the one time per each year every few years where the world would actually come together it was like an intellectual olympics like cultural intellectual olympics sort of rather than being sports it was people coming together okay so you know about this guy because we've talked about this but there is someone out there today who is pitching the idea of bringing back the world's fair basically making a new world's fair right yeah because this is the world's fair already exist like it still happens there was one that you buy recently right now right now so dubai was supposed to have the 2020 world expo i think they were calling it it was this massive thing covet obviously got in the way of that so now they're doing i think it's it's still called 2020 world expo but it's due by 2021 through 2022. but the whole idea is like six months extravaganza people come in it's this huge economic boon et cetera so we recently got pitched on um the idea of the new world's fair bringing it back bring back the world's fair go and do it bigger better than it's ever been before and i want to talk about it because i think it's interesting okay so let's talk about it okay hit me what do you think i mean so i've known about the world's fair my whole life because growing up in montreal the world's fair it was called expo 67 yep it was a big deal and i actually the montreal expos by the way the baseball team and baseball guys so i gotta say it montreal expo is named after expo whatever yeah that's how they got their name so everyone in the city everyone in the city knows about you know how important the expo is yeah where you can go out on the street and just be like what is the world's fair what is an expo and people will tell you is that like the moon landing for canadians it's like everyone knows where they were when the moon landing happened in the us is that like where were you when 67 expo happened pretty pretty much so recently i actually went to i don't know if i told you this but i went to a hotel in montreal and it was world's fair themed and you walked into this hotel and everything like all the walls had like things about the world's fair all the rooms uh like were were unique and different and they all had like you were maybe in like the chinese room or the japanese room or different all that sort of thing and you put on the tv and there's like you know you don't get like cnn or cbs you get like videos old school videos at the world's fair yeah and i actually learned about like i watch this like i turn on the tv and i watch the making of the world's fair and it was just in montreal and there's this beautiful moment where i think like in 1963 they were like we want to do this world's fair um and they built an island in four in four years and they did the impossible it's a story about how they did the impossible and how all of canada came together to make it happen yeah this is like beautiful story and it's very romantic it's very romantic and i think like the more that's that's the common thread of all of um [Music] expo stories or world fair stories is that it's the coming it's the coming together of people and it's the showcasing of these different cultures and there's a lot of nostalgia for that yeah so on one hand i love the idea around like showcasing cultures promoting other cultures bringing people together experiential stuff like i think there's a huge business opportunity there like i'm sure you've seen like museum of ice cream and stuff like that um but on a bigger scale yeah um on the other hand like isn't the internet that like isn't the internet where you like go and like showcase stuff like if i'm coming out with a new product i don't like i don't need to showcase it at like a physical event yeah you know what i mean like that's kind of the bearish case for this yeah i mean i have a lot of thoughts here so basically look i i think this is either there's something i really like about it i love the aspect of nostalgia i love the aspect of bringing people together i think the cultural blending i think it's amazing and a lot of cool things happen when you bring a lot of people together cool businesses i business ideas get formed there's intermingling of thoughts i mean amazing things can happen at something like this but it's got big fire festival vibes too like this this whole idea feels a little bit like okay we're bringing 50 million people together we're gonna you know it's like events are not easy to do i mean i know a lot of people who try to do events our guest today has one of the most successful event businesses in the world i mean it's really hard to do there's a lot of little nuances to doing something like this it's not just like oh yeah slap an idea on a page we're going to go create this massive event 50 million people are going to come we're going to make 20 billion in the first run and to give him credit i mean this guy is clearly selling a really cool story and vision and ambition and it is romantic and it brings up nostalgia he's raised a bunch of money there's real people that are coming onto it so i'm either like in love with the idea and i want to just be a part of it because i think it's going to be really cool or i think it's just like the dumbest thing i've ever heard in my life there's no middle ground for me on this and i don't know where i'm landing on it i think like what's smart about what he's doing is like he he picked a business idea or startup idea that like is called like there's a lot of connection culturally yeah you know what i mean like he's not and in those types of businesses you can raise tons of money because like you're pitching let's say people like me like you know i brought this this is an asterisk it's an asteroid from the expo world's fair 1967 in montreal and like people like me i you know get pitched on it and it's like yeah like it was cool you know maybe i would invest maybe i want to see a new world fair you know and i think like um there's like from an actual business standpoint starting and running something like this is insanely complicated it's it's not like a lot of business ideas we talk about here and some of the things we've talked about in our first shows you could go spin up in a weekend like vp for this there's no doing a 50 million person event yeah even if it's one-tenth of that five million person is a ridiculous undertaking and it needs to involve governments it needs to involve all the municipality like if you're gonna do all these pavilions there's all the building involved i mean there's like a crazy crazy um bunch of coordination that has to happen in order to make this work and so like that's the part where i just like i guess i can't understand the idea because it's so hard to actually execute something like this at a grand scale and in a good way i mean like billy mcfarland right right great fire festival was a great idea i would give him credit for it he's like fraudster and yeah you know did a lot of things that are really bad but the idea of it if he had executed it would have been dope here's what i would do if i was the world the new world's fair guy go for it so i wouldn't raise a lot of money and like go and build a bunch of events from the get-go i would think about how can i build it like how can i do community first internet first validate the demand and then build events cause like right now what he's gonna do is like he's gonna have to go work with cities he's gonna have to get space he's gonna have to like get vendors he's gonna have to coordinate it's a lot of stuff yeah i would you know if i was him i would kind of just build you know start with discord start with facebook groups start you know start with like no code solutions build it out build the demand and then go to like the city of yeah you know miami and be like hey i have a million people who are interested in this thing and there's like a lot of like real digital activity let's translate that into like the physical i like this a lot the way you're thinking about it it reminds me have i ever talked to you about the um the mental model like the map is not the territory have i ever talked to you about this so this is this whole idea that you are fundamentally the map is supposed to be a representation of the territory that you're looking at and the more you abstract the territory into a map the worse it is like the lower fidelity the map is and so if you have you know a massive stretch of land and you're trying to create it into like this tiny map it's gonna be a pretty crappy map because you're trying to boil down this massive piece of territory that's very complicated into something very simple we all create maps like maps or mental models you're going around the world you're trying to create different maps of everything you're looking at and the challenge is when you're using a map that actually doesn't match the thing that you're going and trying to create and do and i think this is a perfect example of where that can come into play which is basically to say he has created a map based on what the world's fair is and it's based on what the past looked like so what world's fairs looked like in 1893 the devil in the white city in chicago this amazing hundreds of pavilions etc and he's using that to play out how you should pursue and build everything when the reality of what you're hitting on is that maybe the world's fair of 2025 2030 looks a whole lot different than what it looked like in the past i mean maybe certain like certainly certainly yeah and the pursuit of building it looks a lot different than what it would have looked like in 1893 or in 1950 or whatever year it was maybe it doesn't have to be like physical at all to your point maybe you end up building a digital world's fair where people can come together because how many people the thing that i push back on with all of this is there aren't that many people that are going to be able to or have the means to travel to these things and in a digital world one of the most exciting trends that's happening is that we're breaking down the barriers to anybody having access to these amazing cultural and intellectual experiences and learning experiences and so if you could build a world's fit like if his idea um can become the genesis of either him or someone else building something really unique that becomes like a hybrid physical digital world's fair-like experience that's pretty darn cool to me i think he he hit on a really smart insight around like people want to connect countries want to show off their you know their stuff and i think that there probably is space for something like this but i think what we're saying it sounds like what we're saying is maybe like the entry point yeah is kind of a bit of a miss yeah and and maybe he's changed and like maybe yeah he's he's going digital first i mean i love the ambition i love the vibe that he's putting on let's talk raising money for let's talk about things we love about this and things we hate about yeah so things things we love you know what do you got i love the ambition i think it's a huge idea which i think is really cool and if you're gonna go build something you might as well build something big i think i can think like steve schwartzman the blackstone guy talks about that where like it's just as much effort to start something small as it is to start something big so you might as well go big and this guy is clearly going pretty big as he talks about the idea and i love that can i just edit that for a second okay so i i totally agree with that sentiment but you don't need your your mvp doesn't need to go bit yeah right minimal viable product doesn't that's true your vision could go big go big but the entry point needs to be covert it has to be tactical it needs to be super smart it has to be intentional and you need to test along the way to your point yeah like i just don't know if there's 50 million people that would want to go to a world's fair today right i don't know is that your kind of bearish hat like no my bearish hat is you just can't do it this is so hard i just think there's so many nuances to doing an event business i mean we like again we'll we'll talk to our guest when he comes in and talk about the nuances of running a an event business but there's just a lot that has to get coordinated around it and when you're talking about on the scale that he's talking about you have to involve national governments municipal governments i mean it's everybody it's insane what do you think happened to this business in 15 years what's your what's your prediction my prediction would be it gets boiled down to something more manageable and doable and that like i think his ambition and his energy is amazing and i never like to bet against people that have good energy so i would guess he ends up getting something spun up that works yeah that's that's that's my vibe with it too is it's rare you meet people who have like that ambition passion and like i think he was able to raise a lot yeah it's not a venture bet like i just i don't understand it as a venture investment though i really don't i just am like i don't know what what's the valuation of a right i mean he's pitching it like it's 20 billion dollar revenue i don't know like dubai world expo is supposed to generate i saw some projection this morning when i was looking this up like 20 billion dollars for the dubai government it's just i like how can i possibly how can you project anything out i think my prediction is he ziggs and he zags yeah and he you know he kind of trojan horses his way in yeah and he makes something happen yeah he seems like the type of guy that can do some ziggy he's gonna make it work man and like i i'm all for that i love people that do this kind of stuff so i i feel like we're at a good spot on it i want to bring in our guest and get his perspectives because he's actually built event businesses and he's actually done the nuances and the details of trying to build something like this out and he'll have a lot more interesting and informed perspectives than we will on it so anthony has a really long career he's done a bunch of stuff he is the founder of skybridge which is one of the most successful fund of funds in the world has done a lot in crypto recently as you know very very cool also the founder of salt which is one of the biggest conferences in the world within the financial world in particular has been very successful but as we all know he's most well known for his 10-day stint as white house head of communications under the trump administration was famously forced out of that position and has been a active critic of our former president since then so really excited to have him man he's very opinionated and a lot of fun to be around as both of us know uh so very excited to welcome into the room where it happens our friend anthony scaramucci the mooch do you mind being called the mooch you call me the mooch you like that cheers just so everybody knows it's 7 a.m these guys are already drinking yeah we're degenerates right that's what we're that's what we're known for so so we were talking before you came in about the world's fair and there's a young man i don't know if he's even a young man he's probably 30. going around raising millions of dollars right now to try to bring back and rebuild the world's fair but you've actually done this [ __ ] like you've gone you built salt one of the most successful financial conferences conferences in general in the world and you built it from the ground up can you just talk about like is this ridiculous is it possible what do you think well your generation is your age i'm assuming you're younger i would never doubt anybody in your generation i think you guys have uh balls courage conviction uh you're more mature than my generation i think we had more fun by the way i i like being the oldest person in the room because i walk in i'm like okay i definitely have more fun than these guys in college because you're not allowed to talk to people anymore everything's politically correct you could end up getting canceled for saying something stupid that didn't happen to us okay we were all reckless and totally fine and there was no social media so there was no record of me being an idiot it just happened to be a full-on idiot so when was that the 80s yeah that was in the 80s yeah right yeah let's let go two-four exactly 60s bloom okay but here's what i would say um a project like that is probably different from a conference right because now you're talking about global exhibition and you're talking about figuring out a way to get at least the 15 or 20 industrial nations involved and so you're creating a mini epcot yeah and so that is a massive undertaking having said that if he can raise some money and he can get the ball rolling and if he's smart enough to do what somebody like a jeff bezos did which is delegate farm out create a uh collaboration with a group of people it's not impossible and you can probably get it done the number number one thing i tell people is you can't do everything yourself but if you got a team you got a great really good group of people and you're willing to collaborate you can get unbelievable amounts done and in my organizations that i've run people work with me they don't work for me see the distinction is very important because if you're working with me you're now empowered you're my partner we're collaborating if you're working for me and you have that ordinance structure it can be limiting and sometimes it could be suffocating so i don't know the guy um but he could be he could be on to something he could pull it off you want to talk to him you want to invest uh i don't want to invest but i definitely talk to him i like mentoring people what advice would you give him you know he's just starting out he's raised a bit of money he's got you know great ambitions oh look i mean they've done the world's fair in a lot of places they did it in knoxville they did it in seattle have you ever been to one the one that i went to in 1964 i just might add i was in the stroller by my mom and dad okay out here in queens those people are probably you know long gone in terms of those planners but i would go to the most recent ones and i would identify people that have planned this thing before and get them in the loop you know we were talking about the small conference i'll take you back to 2009. every major investment bank was leaving las vegas because of the tarp money and so what was that the government gave all the banks money to help defend their balance sheets during the crisis and so they all felt compelled to cancel any high falutin conferences because they didn't want to be seen spending the government's money in a place like las vegas i think president obama didn't do it on purpose but he was like hey now's not the time to go to las vegas and so all these guys canceled and here i am as a small-time entrepreneur seeing that opportunity so wait a minute you know we shouldn't be giving up all of our conferences i'm a smaller company i didn't receive tarp money i'm going to put a stake in the ground and fill that vacuum but i couldn't do it on my own so i called the mayor of las vegas i called steve nguyen i uh you know went to people that have built conferences before michael milken he's my first keynote speaker and so i would tell him you got to think like that you've got a you got a great idea but you're not gonna be able to do everything find people that can help you do the things that you need to do what do you think i mean you built something incredible with salt you just ran i know your most recent one it was in person which was a huge um thing for new york to bring that back and do something in person i know people were really excited about it was a great event by the way i really enjoyed it thank you um what do you think the future of these events looks like post covid do you think it's going to come back and all be in person or do you think it's going to be some kind of digital hybrid experience well i think it's coming back i think we need each other and i think we need the physicality where social organization social organism if you will and i also think that one of our problems is that we're we're always tied into a screen and so we're always here and we're interacting with each other here or over zoom and so we're losing that physical connection so i actually think the conferences are going to be bigger and weirdly better because it's like a concentrated dose of human personal contact so um in the case of our conference we did it at the javits center we ran those air conditioners and those hepa filters over time we paid the money to do that very high ceilings scott gottlieb a friend of mine who's the former fda commissioner came in and gave me a safety protocol which we followed we had a vaccine mandate which i feel very very strongly about and a result of which we had little to no breakthrough covet and people could wear masks or not wear masks because that was the health guidance and of course we had big outdoor spaces for networking so it worked i think people were happy you were there yeah it was great people enjoyed the same event and so i think we're going back to that and i think as we start to normalize and this pandemic becomes an endemic situation which is treatable i had the opportunity to go to the damon runyon cancer research foundation breakfast this morning ken frazier was being honored the former ceo of merck and we had a chance to connect before the breakfast talking about these anti-viral therapies that are coming uh it's gonna be very promising for us you know that's why the future is always bright just people like you guys that are gonna be running the future but you don't wanna think linearly about our society you can get very pessimistic you want to think exponentially about our society and that's where you get very optimistic about technology and things we can do to solve our problems it leads to something really interesting because one of the things i've been most impressed about you as i've learned more about you and as we've gotten to know each other and become friends is you're someone that's come from a different generation you've built in multiple generations different businesses and yet you've been such a massive proponent recently especially of cryptocurrencies and a bitcoin and of web 3 and you're supporting it investing in it with sky bridge and doing all these other things how did that happen like where where did you come from on that what got you so excited about the exponential potential so i have kids your ages yeah they are pains in the ass [Laughter] i'll judge that after the podcast but here's what here's what happens you have to make a generational decision so i can remember my parents thinking that we were naive large generation gap they couldn't learn anything from me and by the way i couldn't learn anything from them and i think that is a very big mistake that generations make you know you guys are in the future and you guys are doing things that i have not experienced you know when you got to college there were computers you know when i was in college believe or not there were no computers we had a mainframe you had to sign up for it and i had to go and wait to get on a terminal that was hooked into a digital equipment mainframe and so if i was typing up a report i had to send it to the mainframe and then someone would print it out for me the next day okay that that's how i grew up just a frame of reference so um but i have life experience i've been through market cycles i think people your age could learn from me in terms of that perspective you know bitcoin is at an all-time high this morning as we're speaking but it could crash by 50 how do you weather those storms how do you think about it so i think my generation can offer that perspective so i want you guys to be open-minded to listen to that but the flip side i've got to listen to you guys i got to listen to what you're working on whether it's programmable biology the blockchain cryptocurrency uh things that could be related to the ecology of the planet we both all three of us know that the planet is not doing well if you look at the diagnostics of the planet the carbon emission the fires the pollution in some of the big cities like beijing as an example we we we don't need to be debating whether or not we're hurting the planet anymore i don't think i think we've litigated that we're hurting the planet we have to figure out how to solve for that so your generation i think is going to come up with those ideas those innovations i've got to be listening to that and so you know what's interesting about my son aj he went to stanford business school bright kid running a venture fund he's a crypto skeptic he's not the crypto bull okay one of his partners happens to be a crypto ball uh but what got me into it is speaking with guys like anthony pompliano uh taking the time to understand it uh one of my intellectual mentors is a guy named charlie munger who's that he's 97 years old he says that bitcoin is the worst thing that's ever happened rap poisoning we've had holocaust we've had earthquakes but bitcoin we've had a lot of bombs go off but bitcoin's the worst thing that's happened civilization and it's surprising to me because when you learn about his life he was a lawyer with the harvard law school uh looked up to him i still look up to him but what did he say know the other side of the argument better than your own argument and so i have found that anybody that studies the blockchain studies bitcoin cryptocurrencies uh a guy like ray dalio a brilliant guy a bitcoin skeptic studies it he buys bitcoin paul tudor jones a skeptic studies it buys bitcoin and i can i could name it yeah ten or five people so once i started to understand it i said okay well wait a minute this is a technological de-layering mechanism for our society we can take the middle men the middle women out of our transactions and we can start transacting peer-to-peer and it has unbelievable long-term ramifications the blockchain is going to allow us to trust each other without knowing each other we don't have to go through a jpmorgan or you pick a firm or wells fargo whoever we can go to each other over the blockchain and i want you to think about the eco-friendliness of that the efficiencies that that will create and it'll free us up to do other things in a society so so for me once i got that once i understood it and i had this conversation with michael saylor yesterday he's become a very good friend of mine is i'm like okay i'm not long enough okay how do i get more long this and then of course i'm dealing with my generation which are pooh-poohing it uh and they're all institutionalists and they don't want to be embarrassed by being wrong as you guys know i've been fired from the white house i got fired from goldman sachs i've been torched in business i don't mind being wrong okay i'm like a human crash dummy i have no problem being wrong what i would encourage your generation to do is take risks hit the pavement and be a super ball you don't want to be bone china okay you don't want to be the guy that went to stanford it's like oh my god i went to stanford so therefore i can't fail i've got to do everything perfectly and i've got to please my parents and i have my career arc's got to be a 45 degree angle take risks be willing to fail because if you're willing to fail then you can get exposure to bitcoin i've got buddies of mine they're like man i i hear what you're saying but i can't be embarrassed if i'm wrong well what do you mean well if i put three percent of my portfolio in bitcoin at eight thousand dollars a coin and it goes to zero now i've embarrassed myself i got huck stirred and it was a con but i'm not at that guy i'm willing to take that risk because i see what you guys see in the future yeah and i think we're all going to be right about it and and but even if i'm wrong about it i have it sized in my portfolio from an allocation perspective where i think it's going to be fine and and i have to deal with now clients of mine yeah that hate bitcoin so i created a etf called crypt crpt it's got unbelievable correlation of bitcoin but it's in coinbase strategy right marathon digital you said i mean so now i can go to my fuddy duddies these old farts and say okay you don't want to buy the bitcoin but how about these companies that are growing at 50 percent a year it's equivocating it's good it's smart yeah you have to like flexible be flexible early plastic you hit on something i mean the super ball thing i've never heard it referenced that way and i think it's amazing you're someone who you've learned how to take a punch really really well and pivot and gather yourself practice and through the last time but like there's something amazing in that and it's probably one of the biggest signals of someone that's going to be successful is the ability to take a punch gather yourself pivot and still fight back after that what taught you that like what what you know what in your life remember i grew up in a blue collar family okay i you know my father didn't give me a lot of advice because he was wearing a green uniform when he went to work uh he was loaded with grease when he came home and uh he got he got up at 4 30 in the morning i can remember my mother putting his lunch pail in the refrigerator at 9 30 at night he came home with 3 30. i mean god forbid you weren't at that dinner table at 5 15. you got your ass kicked by him and but if you were in sports then it was okay but if you weren't in sports you had to be sitting at the table with him and he was a hard guy he was very honest guy uh and he couldn't give me a lot of advice but he said to me something that i'll share with you and you should think about when i got my job at goldman okay so i i graduated from harvard law school my parents think it's hartford law school i mean they have no idea they they're like they want to take me to hartford connecticut i'm like mom it's harvard law school why the hell would they call it hartford law school if it's not in hartford because it's not called hartford law school right it's like everybody loves raymond sitcom right right so i'm coming out of school i got my job at goldman i'm buying myself some suits and my father says to me i want you to never complain about your job and i said what do you mean he goes just remember something about your job you're indoors you're out of direct sunlight and there's no heavy lifting okay i just want you to think about it every second my dad spent 42 years on a crane hot and cold weather uh working the crane crane broke down you got to get out of the cabin fix the crane he did that for 42 years and so here i am blessed with this opportunity to wear a suit you guys dressed like [ __ ] by the way we'll talk about that on our fashion podcast i can't believe the way you're you're launching a pat i can't believe the way your generation dresses it's like unbelievable to me but that's fine these are the billionaires of the today's podcast i'm the pauper but it's fine but i just want to think about that so my expectations were here okay so when you get hit and you watch your father get up in the morning at 3 30. okay this is no big deal okay just got five big [ __ ] deal let me dust off and get back to work oh i'm getting fired from goldman okay fine let me go find another job turns out i found a job at goldman right so this is another funny part of my life they gave me an 11 000 severance check they fired me on february 1st 1991 i'm looking for a job i get a job offer back at goldman the personnel director she's a lovely person she's like him we're going to mark you down as into departmental transfer you'll never have to tell anybody that it got fired can we get the 11 000 check back i'm like no way i need the money i'm paying off school debt i said you can tell the whole plan that i got fired i don't give a [ __ ] you see what i'm saying i mean why would you give a [ __ ] right so now i'm back at goldman working and i realized that i got to start my own business because i don't fit into their culture i don't have the right personality and that's another big lesson for your listeners is don't conform you don't want to be a conformist okay because your life will suck every day will be dread and every day will be work and so you got to figure out who you are and be who you are and be comfortable in your own skin so i realized that i couldn't be there and so i wrote down on my book if i can pay off my school debt the day after i'm leaving goldman sachs to create my own business so i paid my debt off in may of 1996 at the age of 32 i left goldman sachs on december 1st at the end of their fiscal year so low expectations accept failure be willing to pivot you've got to have a sense of you know when you're getting your ass fired from the white house and they're lighting you up on saturday night live and you run into lorne michaels at the met yankee game you know you say hey a little more hairspray please okay the tie wasn't tight enough you gotta roll the exact thing we were talking about at the beginning of the show you gotta lean into it like stuff happens in your life you get embarrassed do you think you're going to last a long time in the white house i said longer than a carton of milk in the refrigerator i think i was going to get blown out like that do you think do you think our generation is softer no i think your generation is self-conscious i don't not softer no you got very tough remember i've been on troop support missions to iraq and afghanistan you got some killers in your generation i don't i don't think they're softer there's a layer of your generation that might be a little entitled where they have high expectations um but there's self-consciousness that you have to do away with so in other words i'm gonna start this company i'm gonna go to the cocktail party i gotta be able to brag about the success of the company and i've got everything figured out i got to tell everybody that that i think is a weakness that's not a strength the strength is telling people authentically what's going on in your life because the minute you can turn to that and you can express your vulnerability people start trusting you they say well how are you doing you said well this is how i'm doing you know we just had a set back here i tried to launch the website it blew up all of a sudden someone looked at you say this is a real guy you know because everybody's dealing with that everybody's got problems and when you're trying to gloss over your situation or paint a perfect picture to me that's a sign of insecurity so i know i think you got very tough people in your job i'm very impressed with your generation i have high hopes for your generation that frankly are going to solve a lot of the problems that my generation cost you know we were kneelers smoking pot they're going to woodstock they're buying people are still smoking pot of course they are but i'm saying they're good they're going they're going to woodstock that then they're driving around in bmws with yellow ties in the 80s now they're peeing on each other in the politics you know you you know it's not enough for me to be 100 right i have to beat your brains in on cable television and that's hurting the country we have to figure out a way to focus not on left or right but what's right or wrong that's why i like reading your stuff because you're looking at it from a heuristic perspective you're looking at it from a clinical perspective what's gonna make somebody successful what's going to make a kid motivated to read and write let's focus on things like that let's not focus on the politics and the unions and also stuff how do we get a kid and give him a platform of equal opportunity i'm all about unequal outcomes i want you guys to both shoot yourselves into space in your own rockets okay like bezos god bless if you can create public good and make that level of public profit and you want to shoot yourself into space and a rocket you know go for it bring captain kirk with you okay but but we have to have equal opportunity you know we have to have a platform of equal opportunity so if i'm born in harlem or if i'm born in an inner city and you know maybe my parents haven't figured it out is there something in our society that can help me figure it out i grew up with a modest amount of money in a middle class environment but they were strong people and they were hitting me to go study and they they wanted us to go to college they didn't know what [ __ ] college it was but they wanted us to go okay and we have to do that for our our young people and you guys are going to figure that out i have high hopes you guys this tech these technologies are going to allow for brilliant educators to enter everybody's classroom if our politics and our policies and how we deal with unions and all this other stuff allow that to happen and that would be transformed it would be very good yeah i think that's what i mean if i were to have a take away from it i think that's what i find so exciting about web3 about cryptocurrencies is that it's not the rich kid that grew up and went to goldman and you know has been an md at goldman for the last 20 years that's getting rich off this it's anybody i mean there's a massive generational transfer of wealth that's happening right now and the incumbents don't like it insiders don't love the fact that anybody can get onto these on rails and operate in this system but it's such a cool thing some some of the incumbents yeah you know some of these things i always say all of them you know listen that's true i love it you know i'm a product of a blue collar but you're a little different i want the society to be flatter i want i want good things you know i was with uh you didn't grow up in a country club culture though going and playing golf on the weekends you've made yourself into what you are that's one of my best stories now we make ourselves into what we are you never do it on your own trust me you need mentors and professors and you need uh parents and you need siblings when somebody tells me they're self-made i did it all on my own i'm like okay it's not possible not in our society right but i'll tell you guys a funny story i'm at the charles hotel boston in boston uh the goldman sachs has set up an interview room and i walk in there and this is the 80s i'm in a hundred percent polyester okay i got a polyester black suit okay i'm like a young funeral director i got a polyester shirt okay i'm literally glowing i mean this [ __ ] can come out of the dryer you don't have to even bring it to the dry cleaner i got a black guido tie and i'm wearing these capezio dance shoes we used to call them cockroach killers because they had points on them you could kill cockroaches in the corners okay and i got them laced up my hair's blown back but like tony monero from saturday night live and i'm in the interview and there's two guys sitting there like you guys are and they're asking me questions about the ted spread and the euro swap and the petrol dollar and i'm hitting every question and and you've got and one guy gets up he says can i can i see you for a sec i said yeah i gotta tell you you're a smart kid you were the worst dressed person that we've ever met at the harvard law school what are you doing in this outfit and i looked at him like i thought i'd look great i had no idea okay and i he says this is my best clothing it's okay listen to me saying i can't bring you to goldman sachs dressed like this you got to go to brooks brothers or j press go buy yourself some like natural fiber clothing okay i was literally fully flammable for my first goldman sachs interview and why am i telling you this because it's a rite of passage you know you don't go from my neighborhood with my family members never hitting a golf ball never swinging a tennis racket never seen the inside of a country club never seen inside of an office building and it's easy you know you go and you have tremors of embarrassment and self-consciousness and doubt as you're trying to find your way and try to try to make that transition so anyway you know that's why i think you guys are dressed like [ __ ] we're not flammable yeah exactly natural fiber it's probably a sign of intelligence though that like i'm dressed like this all cramped in my suit 10 pounds heavier than i need to be and you guys are dressed comfortably and casually it's probably a sign of intelligence i'm gonna have to put on a suit later yeah when i if i go on youtube you're gonna go and talk i gotta do something that's another big thing for me like if you're gonna be on tv generations watch television young and old yeah and older people like seeing people in suits yeah they they don't they get turned off by the other stuff i like looking nice my my profile picture on twitter is still me just being you just do that what's going on with the hair though i got it honestly i know you like looking like but what is this whole thing with the floof and then right there is it yeah low expectations high performance that'll get you along with low expectations yeah the world doesn't owe you anything yeah okay you got to make it happen well yeah but what i'm hearing you say is also the mentality you know your mindset is so so important and almost like your mindset is the difference between 100 of course yeah i also think i mean my biggest takeaway from from some of the stuff you're saying too is you can't do it on your own you said it as it relates to the world's favorite help if you you know what did ben franklin say if you want to make a friend ask a stranger for a favor right that's how you make a friend the beauty is how many times i've done that yeah i wrote about this once yeah of course you got to ask people for because let me tell you something human beings have a nature good human beings where they want to reciprocate reciprocation is a six continent universal language if i do you a favor you are inclined to want to do me one yep and so i ask you to do me a favor now you feel good about yourself and now you know you got an ozy from me yeah you know and it's not linear i'm not making it a quid pro quo you want to do non-linear favors and you want to be a karma bank for people you want people to know they can call you if they're in a pinch and you're going to be there for yeah okay you do that you're going to have a very happy life and you know you wrote about this recently and i tell my kids okay i can only give you two gifts you want to hear me yeah the only thing you can inherit from me are two things forget about the money because the money's not going to make you happy it would make you comfortable two things number one celebrate the successes of your friends and i've seen you write about that i can't emphasize that much you want to be the first call for your friends when something good is happening to them they're flying themselves into space hey mooch i'm flying myself into space that's awesome okay let's go drink champagne together right and then the second thing is find what you really love to do and do that don't do anything else you know what it is i don't know what it is i know what it was for me i like selling at a paper route as 11 years old i love people i like meeting people i like connecting people that's how the small conference came about i like building businesses that are on teams i was a you know played a lot of team sports as a kid that's me that's manifestation of my professional life as a result of the things that i love and that's what you have to do with your life okay and you got to relax like mel brooks says relax none of us are getting out of here you look very relaxed but you're not getting out of this thing alive so you better enjoy drink whiskey you know yeah well what for for what it's worth i you have definitely embodied those principles in my interactions with you i'm super excited that we were able to get you in here and honestly really excited for what your next act is as well yeah and you took my fashion and haircut shots pretty well okay it's a sign that you guys have some personal resilience okay well i appreciate you coming in thanks so much thank you in the room where it happens anthony scaramucci thank you thank you guys all right that was awesome thank you so much seriously it's awesome this is you're the man hell of a discussion man mind blown yeah i love him honestly i know he's gotten a bad rep for some some of the stuff trump administration and his experience favorite man he's a great guy he dropped knowledge tons of interesting insights what were your big takeaways what was the one big thing you took away from that conversation a few i can't i can't give you one well hit me with your first one though i mean top of mind is how important it is when you fall down to get back up and how important that mindset is and yeah he talked a lot about that i think it's just it's okay to you know we talked about that actually in the beginning with that you know some of our memes right like falling that you know if you're gonna if you're gonna walk you're gonna fall he hit me different with that super ball thing that was good yeah i never heard that you need to be a super ball and you need to be able to bounce off things i love that i um you know for me the one big takeaway i had was that you just can't do it alone he referenced it in the context of um of the world's fair actually like bringing it back to our earlier conversation if you're gonna go and do something really ambitious you cannot do it alone and i think that's such a powerful framework for thinking about starting something because the reality with anything when you're going and doing something big you just need to have people you can count on you need to reach out to people collaborate with different people etc and so my call to action like when we think about this community and what we're building we have all these people that are coming together all ambitious all want to learn all want to go do things we should collaborate with each other we should be in the community talking to each other interacting we'll be there to do that alongside you guys it's an amazing powerful thing when we can bring each other up raise each other up and work together to get [ __ ] done yeah and i think uh the beauty about the internet like he was talking about the 80s right you had to like be physically in a place right and now it's just like you don't you know go on your iphone hop into the discord hop on twitter meet people do good things and good things will happen to you and it just compounds he talked about the karma thing and just continuing to help people raise other people up and the benefit that that creates for you and we're creating a platform for that and what i hope we do with this community is continue to build a place where you can do that where you can help each other out where you can look out for one another where you can support one another connect someone with someone else it might not be you that knows the specific thing but if they have an idea and you know someone that might know something about it help each other out connect them we're happy to do it reach out to us but there's something really special here i'm really glad he said those things i'm really glad we had the conversation around it i thought it was a blast i'm gonna do some good things today that's super fun well cheers man cheers and and cheers to you cheers to you guys right why do you look so tired i look so tired because i did not sleep last night have you never slept well or is this a new thing it's not that i can't fall asleep i fall asleep like right away but i wake up a couple hours later and i'm just sitting in my bed and i look at the ceiling and i can't fall back to sleep and i don't know what to do so i was literally you and for the longest time i was this like hustle culture bro sleep when i'm dead didn't want to sleep didn't care about my sleep and then i honestly i started reading more of the research and realizing how impactful sleep is to your longevity to your health all these other things and as part of that i found eight sleep which has completely revolutionized the way i sleep i've heard of aid sleep can you tell me more about it think of it as like the future of sleep all of these mattress companies have created these mattresses they're just stuck they're stock mattresses eight sleep is technology plus sleep combined so the whole product is built around optimizing the temperature that you sleep at and so you read about sleeping cold is the key to sleeping and it's not quite true everyone has a different optimal sleep temperature and it changes throughout the night which is the crazy part about it so you might need really cold to fall asleep and then you might need it to be a little bit warmer to keep you asleep and the eight sleep actually transitions your temperature through the night to keep you at the optimal sleep sleep temperature at any point during the night it keeps you asleep it helps you fall asleep faster and i actually since i started using it have been sleeping better and feeling so much more energized during the day as a result sounds like i need innate sleep i think everyone needs innate sleep so if you're tuning in

special episode time state of the union buying the x games a lot has happened since friday want to bring everyone up to speed we're doing this in public what has happened what are some of the challenges and where do we go from here it's going to be a great one i'm really excited to talk you all through it so basically to bring everyone up to speed friday was a crazy day friday morning we released the episode where i pitched greg and apollo ono on my idea buying the x games and reimagining it completely and basically to put it simply all hell broke loose after that i'm sitting here i post it it starts to get a little bit of traction all of a sudden a couple of big athletes start reposting it the domikong soo jumps on it alexis ohanian jumps in there and then all of a sudden my phone just explodes lindsey vonn is in my dms i'm getting [ __ ] texts from dez bryant who by the way like was on my fantasy team for years look up to that guy crazy athlete insane uh salima masakaela who i grew up watching host the x games is super excited about it there's all these people going nuts i'm getting messages from red bull rockstar monster energy all these big agencies huge investor groups reaching out with interest basically all hell broke loose complete insanity totally unexpected but clearly the interest in the community was vibing on this idea of buying and completely reimagining the x games i was overwhelmed by it so basically had to spend the whole weekend diving into this figuring out what's the path forward what does it look like and what is the real opportunity here so i pitched an idea basically to web 3ify the x games to go and acquire it form a dow to go and buy the x games and then completely reimagine it both in a web 2 sense with uh more traditional media cultural moments uh creating the like drive to survive for the x games but then also bring these web three components nfts special access dow community so that you're really involving the athletes involving the community this fervent community who has driven this culture of these sports for so long involving them in the future of what the x games look like it's such an amazing nostalgic set of events one of the things i was really taken by when i posted this was all of the random people reaching out who you might not consider extreme sports fans or skaters that were reaching out with all of these memories of having watched the x games as kids experienced it these amazing memories they had of tony hawk or these other individuals sean white whoever it might be and these incredible moments that just rang true in their mind as memories and that is so cool to me because it tells me that it extends so far beyond the cultural centers of these sports into broader society i mean candidly what kid did not play tony hawk's pro skater as a kid every single [ __ ] kid played that game because it was dope it was amazing and it was very cool and so there's an opportunity here and i'm further entrenched in my belief now after seeing how this weekend went to go and rebuild this to go and completely reimagine it four sigmatic is the secret sauce behind the where it happens podcast you know how much i've been talking about that hot cocoa the one that's jam-packed with the reishi mushrooms it absolutely has been transforming my mornings i have it at night completely chills me out takes out all my stress and allows me to have a good night's rest after those long days of tequila on the set i'm sure that's helpful i mean it does help the sweet vanilla plant-based protein is the one that i've been going to after my workouts in the mornings it's been a game changer 18 grams of plant-based protein adaptogens jam-packed with mushroom goodness it's been a complete game changer for me so to go check it out go to 4sigmatic.com and use code the room at checkout greg why do you look so tired i look so tired because i did not sleep last night have you never slept well or is this a new thing it's not that i can't fall asleep i fall asleep like right away but i wake up a couple hours later and i'm just sitting in my bed and i look at the ceiling and i can't fall back to sleep and i don't know what to do so i was literally you and for the longest time i was this like hustle culture bro sleep when i'm dead didn't want to sleep didn't care about my

the way you sleep rest recover so that you're ready to take on all of life's challenges check out eightsleep.com where it happens to get a discount on your first product here's a tip don't be like greg eisenberg be like saaho bloom so let's bring everyone up to speed on where we are what's happening and what are the next steps so basically there are unique challenges with buying the x games relative to say buying the constitution and i want to walk people through that because i've gotten a ton of excitement around the dow idea people are like already clamoring to send eve contribute to it get commitments going get a discord channel going all of that stuff and i think that's great the excitement's amazing but there are some unique challenges here that we have to think through and we have to be cognizant of prior to this prior to what i'm doing right now i spent seven years working in the investment world doing deals buying companies i'm on the board of a big company in the motocross space fox racing amazing company and i know what it's like to actually go and buy a business and it is messy uh there are so many layers of complexity here that go beyond what anyone would really imagine when you think about just buying an asset i mean there's employees employee contracts pension liabilities all the media contracts that they have legacy contracts things that are screwed up there's a bunch of liabilities that are sitting out there i'm sure so there are all of these layers of complexity that are so far beyond what like a constitution dow would have had to deal with we're not buying a piece of paper we're buying ip and a business that is really meaningful and really needs both a capital uh structure to go and actually acquire it but also an operating structure to go and do it and that comes with a lot of complexity so when i was having conversations over the weekend the biggest thing that jumped out to me was we need to be very very deliberate about the strategy here and what to me that means is that a hybrid approach to acquiring the x games is the smartest way to go about doing this what do i mean by a hybrid approach in a you know fully dow approach you raise 50 million dollars or 100 million dollars whatever the number is and you go and just buy the entirety of the x games why do i think that's challenging here um as much as i love that as a cultural moment for the future of web 3 i don't think it's a viable path forward to actually getting this done why first off this isn't like a christie's auction of the x games espn and disney bob iger is not going to be at a christy's auction saying oh 50 million i got who got 50 million 51 million i got 52 million here who going once going that is not how this deal gets done espn and disney uh believe in the legacy of this business espn incubated this started this it means something to them they know it means something to the community and so they're going to be very deliberate about who they sell to now what does that mean it means that the top dollar doesn't necessarily win you might have a dow bid at 75 million and if someone comes in at 60 but they're a very credible investor group they have an operating team and there's less kind of legal hoops to jump through because it's not a dow buying a company espn and disney are likely to go with that other bid and what that means to me is that the best path forward is this hybrid approach which is partner with um a very credible investor group investment fund who has executed against reimagination strategies in the sports and media space there are several of them out there there are a bunch of funds that everyone would know there's the churning groups of the world the reigns the um the people that did ufc sold it to wme all of these groups have done a ton in this space and are excited um you know would look at something like this would be excited about it and that is a really interesting thing because if we can partner with a group like that and do something that looks more like a joint capital structure maybe it's a dow taking a minority position in the future capital structure of this business that is really interesting and the reason i think that's interesting is because now you have an opportunity to actually go and get this done i think it's great to go and get excited about the full kind of dow bid to buy this i don't think it's realistic that you could go get that done and so if our interests are to go get this done and to go actually execute against the future of this and make it this amazing thing that we all think it can be i believe that this is the path forward to do it and so what i've been doing over the last several days is having conversations with a variety of investment funds and investing groups who reached out they saw this go out it reached a ton of people the thread did over 2 million impressions a lot of people saw it and i was contacted by a bunch of these groups why i think a lot of these groups realize that there is a huge opportunity to bring in a community bid athlete and community group uh to partner with them on a transaction there's a bunch of advantages to doing it that way beyond just the web three ification and people who really understand the web three angle of this the earned media that would come from having the community involved in this is immense you would have so much excitement around going and executing this transaction if there's a dow component if there is a community component versus just another private equity fund going and buying a media asset this becomes much more exciting for the media it becomes much more exciting of a transaction and the execution would generate a ton of interest and probably create a wave that you could really ride into the reimagination of all of this so i think there's a really exciting opportunity to do something there i'm having conversations with a bunch of these groups this week seeing who is most viable who's interested who's far down the path there are rumors swirling around in the space that somebody is getting close to a transaction here need to understand that figure out if there's an opportunity to collaborate to be involved to get the community to get the athletes to the table so that's really a big next step here is to figure that out and understand what is that path forward to getting something done and then once we figure out what that path forward is go out and actually execute my future vision of it is still i would say a little bit amorphous i think we need to figure it out but having a dow involved in the cap table in some way shape or form i don't know what the legality is of it yet i think we need to jump through the hoops on that front but to figure that piece out and maybe it's just that this dao the community uh the athlete bid that comes in as part of the capital structure is in charge of the web 3ification maybe that's kind of the core owned piece for this future you allow the investor group to kind of run the broader strategy with an operating team that's executing against the cultural moment the media side of it all the contracts all of the complexity there and the dow is in charge of reimagining the web three iffication it could be a very very real credible thing um to create so as i'm looking at it today that's how i'm thinking about it to me this is like a man on the moon moment for web 3 if we can go out and execute this and i don't really say that lightly i really do think that web 3 and having a dow or something that looks like a dow uh acquiring a share of a large operating business with the potential to be a billion dollar plus ip franchise is a huge huge step forward for the space i mean maybe man on the moon is dramatic uh call it the four minute mile moment maybe it's the four minute mile moment roger bannister breaks the four-minute mile suddenly everyone within within six months a bunch of other people did it within a year a bunch of other people did it because all of a sudden it was like oh the four minute mile is no longer this thing that holds you up maybe this is that moment for web3 maybe we can create that as a community we can come together go out and execute against something like this and really create that special moment that vaults the entire space forward that vaults the idea of community ownership community governance forward and participation from the athletes from the community from the fans and allow the future athletes to participate in the value that they create for this as well so i'm super excited about it i think there's a ton to do there's a bunch of athletes we haven't heard from a bunch of people i really want to get involved i mean tony hawk if you're out there if you're listening to this you got to get involved in this man this is a huge huge moment for the space you would be the perfect person to have involved arnold schwarzenegger i've heard you're interested would love to have those people involved sean white i mean all of these athletes that are out in the space that have been driving these extreme sports forward for so many years this is your opportunity to have more ownership for this and to create a legacy that extends well beyond yourself to allow the future athletes of your sport the legacy you guys created to persist in a really meaningful and in a beautiful way so i'm extremely excited about it i hope we can continue to push this forward i'm going to do this whole thing in public i said that from the get-go i'm going to add this episode to the tweet thread i'm going to continue to provide updates there as i learn more obviously there's going to be certain things that are confidential in the process who's involved but i'm going to share absolutely as much as possible and we're going to go do this thing and i actually think there's a real path to going and getting this done and i wouldn't have said that on friday when i put out the idea so it's pretty exciting that i'm sitting here on monday recording this and in the span of four days three days whatever it's been we've completely flipped this entire thing on its head and we have an opportunity to actually go and do something special here so stay with me super excited about this and to close out this episode i want to bring in a good good buddy of mine who is extremely credible to talk about this stuff it's my buddy sam shortstein he was in charge of the reimagination of the xfl so prior to covid vince mcmahon over at the wwe uh i think he put 500 million of his own dollars into uh restarting the xfl it took off it was totally insane if anyone watched it it was awesome the content coming out of it the virality was [ __ ] phenomenal uh unfortunately they only got like three or four weeks of games in before covet turned the world upside down and because of the stock market crashing vince mcmahon pulled the plug on the whole thing so sam was really in the trenches for a year and a half two years when i was starting to ideate on the x games idea i called sam um and bounced it around i was basically he was the guy i called to say tell me i'm an idiot um what what am i missing here so i want to pull them in we're going to riff for a couple minutes on how you might actually reimagine this and then we're gonna put this out to the community and we're gonna get it out and let's keep this thing rolling forward i will continue to provide updates as we push this thing and uh let's go buy the x games so i'm gonna pull sam in sam welcome to the show there he is sam shortstein the man the myth the legend uh sam i just gave you an intro um i hyped you up i gave you i gave you uh a good good plug i need you to tell the story very quickly of um bud light seltzer um and how you guys integrated that because i think it's a very unique story to think about as we think about reimagining the x games and the future of sports and media yeah absolutely um thanks for having me on sawho uh you know when we were at the xfl we had to reimagine everything that we were doing and we were looking at different spaces and how they do brand integrations right how do you mix the corporate with the culture right and people can tell it's almost like the uncanny valley when you're not doing it the right way so seltzer bloodlight seltzer came to us they just launched their competitor to the white claw business and they're like hey we want to we want to put the seltzer you know we want how do we get this in your players hands right um because that's really what they care about they don't want signs they want in players hands so we said we'll put in the locker room right i can't tell them to drink it but you know i can't influence them to drink so what i did is we just put it in the in the locker room and uh we've tried it out with the hey the winning team is going to get the seltzer the salt separation or whatever and uh this team time the away team won uh in our facility at ballpark in arlington that we had helped convert to a football stadium now and the couple of guys are looking at the seltzer like what is this like what are we doing here like it's you know normally a beer drinker guys are you baiting me are you trying to [ __ ] me you're trying to force me to drink this seltzer they look at me like what am i supposed to do with this i'm like do what you want with it and because of the connection to wwe it's funny you know taylor heineke who's now the starting quarterback for the washington football team he starts doing the stone cold celebration he didn't play it down he was the backup quarterback you know at least our stone cold celebration the other backup quarterbacks getting on it the kicker's getting in on it um and it was viral moment viral moment we had a bunch of players commenting on it former nfl players tori smith were commenting on it and it and it kind of brought this new brand integration um you know my my my buddy chris seglia he runs one of the largest esports streaming companies uh tenno media and he was like you gotta get in their hands get it in their hands get in their hands and that was a unique way of us like how is seltzer aligned with football well through that post-game celebration yeah it's crazy to think about all the opportunities that exist like that i love that story because it's basically just like go do something different and you create all these unique earned media moments that all of a sudden you're like replicating personality right everyone wants personality around these things that's what i said on the original episode when i released it was drive to survive was so great not because of the production value or anything they were doing it was because they put [ __ ] faces behind these cars it used to be a car driving around a track which is great formula one was a great sport but it was niche all of a sudden my wife is watching drive to survive and she's like oh lewis hamilton versus this guy and that personality and i like oh how's that guy doing i want to watch him because now you have a face like i've put a name to the face it's no longer a car and for the x games there's such a unique opportunity to do this exact thing you put personalities behind this because you and i have talked about this there has not been a really big face or name around extreme sports in a long time in the way that there used to be when we were growing up the tony hawk the sean white they were like cultural icons and you can go and recreate that by doing something unique on the media side here yeah you know i i look at um nigel houston is probably better than some of the guys that we grew up watching but and his clothes are even better than what tony hawk had but it's not the same type of getting people there it's the streets it's not as it's not as high flying as what we used to travis pastrana jumping over 50 monster trucks doing evil knievel stuff you know so yeah that's another good point though it's like the espn has focused so much i think disney and espn have focused so much on the like bigger faster higher stronger of the x games rather than on the personalities and the people and creating a face to it and it's always been like oh this guy's gonna do a you know 1080 you know flip mctwist whatever like it's some insane jump my eyes literally cannot process that number of spins like when i watch that um i remember when tony hawk did like the 900 and it was a huge moment beyond a 900 i literally can't process and at some point you can't spin like your body literally won't allow it to happen and so the spins are you can't keep getting higher and higher on that what you can do is create personalities around this create a face to all of this and basically create something unique that people want to engage with that they want to go spend money on in person that they want to share on social that they want to go put money behind merch nfts all of the web 3 components of it get access to these personalities i mean you can recreate cultural icons uh totally outside the context of the actual event you know another thing about it is the age of the people so ryan sheckler at 13 tony hawk was a prodigy it can steer younger traditional american sports like even in my league we had technically no restrictions we didn't have a collective bargain agreement uh but we still didn't go after players more than three years out of college right ryan scheckler was 13 when he hit the scene in skateboarding and there's a and the young guy just hit a 1080 right and he's like 14 years old it steals younger as we get younger and you can create stars that way versus traditional sports you have to go much older route and there's people waiting to identify you know ryan shukla had a tv show at 16 years old this these types of things can be recreated through different mediums now distribution the other thing that's come up to both of us is prize money and i think it's a brilliant point that i hadn't thought of but you can create this virtuous cycle if we buy this um you know if we partner with the right people and we can go start to reimagine it you can create a virtuous cycle that makes it more and more relevant for the athletes for the fans and that's around prize money right like the prize winnings right now are like 25 grand 30 grand someone wins if they win the x games and that's insane um that's like the olympics right like these guys are making no money for a lifetime's worth of work and there's a real opportunity here because if you create more media around it if you create these cultural icons more revenue starts coming into the business the ip is worth more the athletes are generating more revenue because they can do these web 3 things they can sell nfts for unique access they're able to profit from their likeness more than just like the instagram brand deals and the things they're doing now all of a sudden that prize money number goes way up uh you have more revenue coming through this thing it just creates an engine right all of a sudden you start having a quarter million dollar prize winnings you have a million dollar prize winnings and that's a moment now all of a sudden the athletes are like this is my goddamn super bowl um i'm really going to focus on training for that because this is a huge moment there's create much more culture around it there's much more excitement around it and you create this virtuous cycle that i think just just self-replicates it's a self-fulfilling prophecy for a lot of people that that really excites me you know i'm in the same boat because of the xfl we had a pay to play pay more to win right and so i paid my guys a thousand bucks a week and then every game they played and they got a thousand bucks but then they got a a bonus of two thousand dollars and or two thousand twenty one dollars why right because we're going to the 2021 season right like our 2020 season right and pay more to win and so that's why you know when there's a interview with taylor heineken that's why he's celebrating so much is he just made two thousand dollars right the grand scheme of things is not that big but when you add a prize money to the competition it makes it different the international for dota 2 their big tournament they are they do a really good job integrating uh units bought in the esports space in dota gets a revenue split with the championship the winner so they're the largest prize pool in esports not even the biggest game but they can get up to 11 million dollars wow prize pool and that's the attraction there versus i think league of legends might be three million dollars for the team org that doesn't cover one player's salary but you know dota 2 you're going really high up in that price pool that gives a lot of people hey this is why i should be watching this is why i should be competing in this game versus another game and it really gives that opportunity we all can rally around money now yes there's going to be exposure opportunities here and hey you should come compete in the x games versus other action sports competitions because we're on espn that doesn't work anymore you need to get people in by people and then like you saying with community engagement it makes even more money uh impeccable for your fans when they can directly compensate the athlete instead of going through a middleman totally it also just as the athletes have direct ownership in these things as the community has direct ownership and so they all have a vested interest in seeing it continue to accelerate and grow that's so powerful and it's what web 3 i think is figured out in a big way is just this idea of community ownership and you know the progressive um decentralization the progressive kind of communitization of a lot of these spaces is really interesting because all of a sudden not only current athletes but future athletes have real skin in the game to see this continue to accelerate and grow and i don't think it's a zero-sum game of like you play in the you know you participate in the x games versus in something else i want this to be like totally open source you know um you know like interoperable with other events other series people are doing they should the athletes they should really want to participate in this because it accelerates their value they're given the resources they're given the tools to go and execute against um you know real brand building for them personally that they can extend anywhere i think one of the things that's you know the biggest disservice to athletes broadly is that they have these short shelf lifes as athletes and they haven't been given the tools and resources to really capitalize on being top point zero one percent in the world at something during that window there's a couple athletes and it's like survivorship bias thing you hear about the guys that make fifty million eighty million hundred million dollars you and i both have some friends that have done that um not that they're happier than other friends who have made less money than that but they were able to capitalize very few do that and so i think if you can create a world where these athletes have the tools and resources through the x games to brand build to extend the lifetime of their value and to really engage directly with the fan base and profit from that direct engagement with the fan base there's something beautiful and really brilliant that can happen here so i'm super fired up about this i'm also just really excited by how much community engagement came in since posting about it i'm excited about the athletes that want to get involved i'm also excited about the athletes that haven't responded yet that we should be able to go out and get because they should be on board with something like this so i think there's a really really interesting opportunity here i want to as i said earlier in the episode i want to go run down the traps on the investor groups that are looking at this i want to figure out who's most excited about the strategy who is most excited about you know having a uh dow involved having a web3 angle to doing this whole thing because if there's someone that's going in to do this and isn't thinking about it in you know the right way or in our view thinking about it in a you know in a truly inclusive way for the community i don't think that's an approach that we would want to take so partnering with the right people and trying to go get this done and you know showing disney espn etc that there's a vision to make this a really really bright future for the x games and for this ip that they incubated is a key part of it so i'm really excited about it i think there's a really bright future here and looking forward to seeing next step so appreciate you joining sam you're the man i'm going to continue riffing on this with you for sure because i think you're one of the brightest minds on on reimagining the future of sports and media and going to be involved no matter what here when we go get this done so let's um let's keep plugging along and uh let's go buy the [ __ ] x games awesome man let's arm the rebels as greg says let's do it arm the rebels i love it i love it all

talking about that hot cocoa the one that's jam-packed with the reishi mushrooms it absolutely has been transforming my mornings i have it at night completely chills me out takes out all my stress and allows me to have a good night's rest after those long days of tequila on the set i'm sure that's helpful i mean it does help the sweet vanilla plant-based protein is the one that i've been going to

go to 4sigmatic.com and use code the room at checkout what's going on man not much uh what there's a bunch of [ __ ] i want to talk about today so i kind of just want to dive right into it but i saw this really cool thing the other day this i think it was the wall street journal there was this article about chess and ever since queen's gambit on netflix i've been like sort of into chess and um it was this article about magnus carlsen who's like the most legendary i think now considered the most legendary chess player of all time and um it's about his like new nemesis who like right now i think as we speak they're playing in dubai and the like world chess championship it's like a best of 13 or something series and they keep facing off um and the cool thing about the story and like the human interest side of it was that this guy ian nepo something it's a very complicated last name uh was basically a prodigy like he served as the second they call it for magnus carlsen like seven years ago at this event which is the person that basically like shadows you and kind of like plays the opposing role to you and so it's like at the time people were saying oh wow this is kind of crazy uh magnus carlsen's using this guy like this guy might end up being one of the best players in the world he might have to face off against him and then it would have been an advantage and now like seven years later they're literally facing off against each other in the championship and this guy apparently is like the best chance at taking down magnus carlson that has happened in the last like 10 you know 15 15 years whatever since this guy's been around that's insane so it's kind of cool it's like a um it's this cool story of like something actually coming to fruition and like the prodigy like is actually coming and going to take down the mentor the student has become the teacher yeah it's kind of cool so i was like reflecting on it and one of the things i was reflecting on with it was like why do i even give a [ __ ] about chess i had never played chess that was my next question well yeah i like never played growing up really i dabble but queen's gambit was my connection point to chess it was during covid yeah queen's game but if you haven't seen it as like this show on netflix freaking amazing it was so good so engaging and when i looked it up to do some research for this episode i saw that like chess uh play and chess purchases skyrocketed after queen's gambit hit and so it was this very cool example to me of like culture um and media driving some like esoteric uh nuanced niche sport or game or whatever it is into mainstream and that got me thinking about an idea that i want to talk more about and that idea is i want to buy the x games i like where this is headed so just to set the stage for anyone that doesn't know the x games were an extreme sports event not dissimilar to the olympics um there was like a winter and a summer started by i think by espn in like 1995 providence rhode island was the first x games um and became a kind of a mainstay like for the 2000s when i was a kid the x games were kind of dope like yeah the winter x games sean white was like the big guy snowboarder red hair um you had you know like the tony hawks of the world and the skateboarding on the x games it was a big deal it was a big thing um and then somewhere along the line in like the 2010s and beyond it started to languish and it declined i don't know whether actual uh participation in the sports declined or whether just espn and disney after they acquired espn did just a poor job kind of amplifying um the games or what it was but somewhere along the line it started to decline and it's not like extreme sports declined it was just i don't think i don't think that was the case i don't think so i mean i'm on the board of some companies in the space and it's been like gdp growth low single-digit growth generally speaking in these extreme sports but fervent you're a community guy fervent communities people just love the sports are very very into it um and so it got me thinking about the x games and what's going on with them and so i did some research turns out espn last year said they were trying to sell them they're prioritizing streaming and other things at the disney level and so espn is trying to rid themselves of this originally they wanted 100 million dollars and they were going to keep producing it no one took them up on it and so then they were offering the x games you could buy all of the ip of the x games for 50 million dollars and i want to go buy it and i'm very i'm quite quite serious about it and i want to like i want you to tell me why i'm being dumb or why this isn't going to work so my vision for the x games is you go and you create a cultural moment so like what did queen's gamut do so well with chess what did drive to survive the formula one do so well that vaulted formula one it was that they created a personality a face that actually went with these sports um drive to survive previously it was watching a car on a track and it was like you're just driving around all of a sudden you watch drive to survive and you know the faces of all these athletes suddenly i'm looking and it's like that's not just a car that's lewis hamilton that's max verstappen and that completely changed the game formula one viewership through the roof now in america as a result crazy why can't you do that exact same thing with the x games amazing personalities with big cult social followings good looking people in general that are very athletic and working on really cool things you have the base of this fervent community all you need to do is suddenly like expand that with a cultural moment and i think you could do that by creating one of these like kind of follow along like rags to riches type stories where you're following people and the personalities and you create these personalities and this tension that then you can play off of in the games so so much i love about this sometimes i like to just disagree with you on please do but it's hard to on this one i think like the question for me really is like beyond the content production of hey let's let's commemorate these people and create these moments um what else is different in in in this new version of the x game so for me like what what i would do is i would web 3ify the x the x games right like give people a vote um let's do this let's do this exercise this is a great i love that you went this direction i hadn't thought of this i was thinking like you just go do the x games in a new way with this culture moment let's do the what is web 3 x game what does the web 3 future of the x games look like well i think the first is to your point you start with the the athlete and you reward the top 1000 [Music] fans of each athlete with an airdropped nft or token and that token gives you you know certain access and and you could vote on where this person can go or what they can do you can go to different events i think like i love the idea of like if there's 5 000 athletes um on on the x games like f they should be throwing there should be an event every single day that these athletes are throwing and that are bringing like local communities together it shouldn't be that these athletes play just for one week in this the summer and the winter but that they're like like musicians they're touring you know two-thirds of the year and i think with your idea around content and creating content which are just essentially excuses to talk about things and web 3's ability to reward fans and give them certain levels of access and and voting i think that you know that version of the x games is yeah interesting yeah so what you're hitting on is super interesting which is when you go and do this the x games ip doesn't give you access to the athletes you need to give the best athletes in these extreme sports a reason to be a part of this and so part of the whole pitch i think web 3 actually creates a really good pitch here which is we're going to give the athletes and we're going to prioritize the athletes with immense tools to become monetizable in a much deeper way and to create way more access and we're going to build ip around you as an athlete that we know is going to expand the value of the x games and the property we're building but it's going to arm you with ways to monetize that you never previously had you have big social followings now we're going to give you arm you with ways to leverage nfts for specific access to events to amas to different things you know super fandom around you we're going to go we're going to go do an interesting like series tour rather than just having it be a summer and a winter games where it's like so event driven and it's a couple of weeks we're gonna make it a much longer thing we're gonna do this show around it maybe there's nft access to the show where you now have uh people that are kind of directing and pitting matchups within it so that it's like creating and stoking intrigue the same way conor mcgregor kind of created um you know ufc in a big way i mean actually ufc is a great case study of this because i've seen an interview with dana white where i was just talking to my friend who launched the xfl sam schwarz dean as his name he was at stanford with me and he launched the xfl it unfortunately fell apart due to covid but it was an incredible case study of going and trying to do something innovative he was telling me the story about dana white and dana white talks about basically ufc was on its last dollar and they threw a hail mary and that hail mary was the like ultimate fighter series thing that they did where it was like a reality show of trying to make it to the octagon and like go make it to the top and that was fundamentally like going and doing something that kind of created personalities and created a vibe around it and we're going to go do that for these athletes it's going to create immense value for them and make the games much more valuable also make these athletes much more valuable the other layer to this which i have to say is i think we should form a dow to go buy the x games right and it would be the first time that like a large uh games property ip was owned by a government you know collective body and a community and it would be so cool because the games themselves and the sports have such amazing communities and so to be able to involve the communities in the decision making around what these games look like what these properties media properties look like what the web theorification looks like it would be such a cool example and case study and like constitution dab just went raise 40 or something like that to go try to buy the constitutions a piece of paper no utility to it the x games that's like real utili i mean there's an event there's things you can go to there's like real business value to that and so i'm staring at it like we should we should go form a dow to go buy the x games yeah i think uh what i like about this idea is there's there's so much trust that's been built between athletes and viewers already and the communities exist and it's just about like you mentioned kind of like stoking the you know giving the tools or arming the rebels for athletes and it's also about arming the the audience like it's give you know supercharging the audience so that they could be more involved and get involved so um i like this idea i also it gets me thinking about like will traditional sports leagues like the nfl and hl mlb start embracing web3 or will there have to be or will there be like dao's buying the xfl the x games whatever or will there be like brand new web 3 sports leagues and esports leagues that come out and we're starting to see this i think there's one i forget the name and esports um i think uh that's the question and i believe that we're probably like number three and number two are more likely to happen yeah it's an interesting question because um sports are a great place for this to happen because fundamentally the community is creating the value and it's like green bay packers what is the value of the green bay packers but for the incredible fandom that's built around it and when i think about the x games that's what i think about that's why i'm so excited about this idea honestly and so i want to do it i'm actually being fairly serious about i don't think 50 million dollars is actually i don't know whether it's a dow or if you go pitch an investment fund on going and doing it and going doing it but if i can't get excitement around a dow i don't know what i can get excitement around um and so i'm actually pretty serious like wag bxg wag bxg we're gonna buy the x games that's what i'm coining um but we should bring in our guest to talk about this because our guest today is this is crazy for me he's like someone that he's like your hero well i hero i don't know maybe it's a strong word i've looked up to him for a long time grew up watching him um compete win at the highest level two olympic games you look up to yeah i think he's amazing um and i've recently connected with him in this new life context and we've become friends and that's crazy to me yeah that like how the world like the universe and the way this has all come together and now we get to sit down with him and chat absolutely we're gonna bring in our guests apollo ono and we're looking forward to the conversation we're gonna buy the x games first time that uh we've interviewed someone with multiple gold medals yeah first time maybe the last i don't know we might get michael phelps on the show but for now most gold medals ever won on the where it happens show so enjoy it wag bxg did you guys go to the yacht party yesterday no i heard about it though it was like a lesson in marshall yeah so dude i just left before they even performed yeah and then someone was like asking someone's asking me they're like why would you do that and i was like that's a good question and then like i came to the realization i was like i just i personally don't really care yeah exactly i understand music i love marshmallow i've done events with him before um you know like i love alesso i've done stuff with him in the past but i guess like you know when we have like different career paths or different things that are what we believe to be important those times yeah we then like carve out time necessary you're also able to make better decisions around stuff like that when you're sober so like the fact that you don't drink i actually think helps i'm making a bad decision while i'm sober imagine if i wasn't yeah like seriously i mean like i have a really tough time making a decision to leave something and like make that trade-off when i'm like past the point of being a bit drunk like i just that's when i'm like someone comes up and says like oh come on it's marshmallow and i realized later i'm like i don't care that marshmallow's here i don't even know who that is right that's it that's my my take is that there's so much noise out there and that there's like i see people on twitter saying like i need to be an art pass i need to be arpes so it's like you don't actually like you might have a really good time at arbazel and that like it might be super fun but like from like a career business perspective my take right now is that new world that we live in like just go and build the thing that you're building be in the discord just yeah like it's probably more alpha yeah and like get a good night's sleep yeah i do think i mean like when you're first trying to get into it immersing yourself in it in a few different ways like i had never really spent time in the like crypto nft web 3 world until nft week and i spent that whole week going to events and that was the first time i was just like i was just holy [ __ ] man like there's the the techno optimism of it the like positive sum mentality of people all being together and all of the like cool things that were being built and just like the wild [ __ ] that was happening around it i found amazing i just thought it was so cool to see um and so for me that was like that was definitely worth it the second it's diminishing returns right the second set of events you're like this week i'm not quite as motivated to go to the full slate that i went to that week that's awesome that you feel like um it's a good perspective well because i'm gonna see the same people for the most part right to your point the same people one thing i want to add because bob back just my friend just walked in one of the reasons i left that party was it was like one of those like big lines guest list bouncers yeah and like i had a plus one but they didn't honor my plus one very la new york yeah exactly and honor my plus one so my friend couldn't get inside i heard he was very strict very strict and like i kind of don't want to be in the like i don't want to be in that room straight up i actually do not want to be in that room because you don't believe in that like exclusivity unnecessary i don't like that vibe like i don't know it's something i guess i grew up with like i just don't i don't like the vibe where it's like there's some people who are excluded i don't like that exclusionary vibe where they make a line for no like no reason yeah yeah that's interesting yeah it's interesting it's also web like crypto and web like it's i personally i think of it as like open access meritocracy borderless anyone can do it a kid on the streets in india has the same access to that discord channel as a kid growing up in greenwich going to a country club i keep using that example but it's very true and so then when you like stick a line in front of something and it's like guest list oh you're not on this list you can't come in it actually does feel anti the ethos of what we're all here for and what we're trying to build that's why i like fwb so they're throwing a party tonight except the party is you just need at five five fwb right what is that how much does that cost what is five fpv tokens now i don't know 50 bucks maybe okay we're talking you know so it's like nothing crazy and they allow people to go and buy it which versus like hey i'm gonna select who is on and this is not a you know i'm not trying to like this kygo like i'm sure you know he's a great guy and like the people who through the event moon pays like they're great i love them i love that team it's not like a knock on them it's just like a knock on like yeah the list like culture yeah yeah um so i think we were are we rolling okay yeah he hit us with the cold open so we were yeah we're good but i think that's like very human though yeah but like so i think you know like right now we've got these like layers right and everyone's like trying to put these like you've got this bottle of bottle of like liquids that are like in chemistry and every like layer is like labeled something right and right now it's like all shaken up everything's mixed up right and over time that [ __ ] just goes back to normal right because humans are still operating in the same kind of neanderthal like ego based still chasing the same thing and i think we like to hide behind this idea that we're here for maybe a greater purpose and cause and i do believe that is the case like if you really zoom out but still i think in the acute moments we're still driven by the same things that we want desire want to reflect upon i mean it's the same cultural phenomenon that's existing we're just using different tools to exemplify what we believe we should be hiding behind or represent in certain perspectives i don't know that's that's my take i like that unpack there i agree with you in principle i do think i think humans are status signaling monkeys the exact same way we were 10 000 years ago and i think we're seeing a lot of the new manifestations of that and i do i agree with you there's like there's nothing i'm not a particularly religious person so i don't particularly believe in like some you know brilliant afterlife i sort of just believe that you're here to procreate and you're here to hopefully have fun and smile along the way but that the reality of it is like your purpose is what you make of it and if you can you know create and rationalize a purpose and something that motivates you and makes you happy then that's great i like that's also why i just believe in being nice to people and i like being around people who are just like you and i only recently met but the first time i met you i was like this is just like i admired you and looked up to you for a long time as a kid because of your work ethic and the things you were doing and what you were about the things you spoke about and then i met you and i was like oh this is just as positive a guy as i hoped and that's not always the case that you meet people and you you feel that same way that um they just you want other people to succeed and you're happy and you just like that vibe and that personality i think is infectious and so it bums me out when you then meet people and they don't have that or they're kind of a dick and you're just like why are you being an [ __ ] we were talking about this last night with a famous investor that we all know it's like why are you a dick there's absolutely no value to just being an [ __ ] just be nice to people it doesn't cost you anything so anyway it's a weird transition but i um well i mean the transition i will say because i don't know you we just met like a second ago but i will say that we've done this is our fifth recording today and [Music] three out of five people when we've said that you're coming in they're like oh that guy's such a good guy that's such a nice guy oh tell him i say what up yeah you know so what you know i feel like you're leaving a trailer you're leaving a trail and i feel and i think well so first nice to meet you nice to meet you yeah it's the cold open man i love the cold open but it is um this whole thing is very funny to me and um we're gonna die i swear we're gonna talk something like interesting life in business though but the whole i do need to track the course of this because as i said i grew up watching you and really admiring your career and everything you were about and your work ethic i was someone that was driving for something athletically and it was very um empowering to me to see someone that had worked at something so hard and your grind and the effort you put in i thought was amazing um what i now think is amazing is we live in a world and we're doing things where somehow our paths have crossed and we've connected and now i'm sitting here and i'm having this weird like holy [ __ ] life moment of someone that i like grew up watching admiring all of a sudden i can sit have a conversation with and learn things from and be present with and hopefully other people can listen to it benefit from it in the same way i felt i did so there's this crazy thing happening at least for me in my mind of like the universe and the way all of this stuff comes together and so i'm just personally very grateful and excited to uh excited to get to chat about tech business web three your ethos on life um can we start with your idea you're talking about yes i do want to start there i do want to start there so the way the way the show works is super casual we just like to jam on cool things with with friends and it's not an interview per se but we want to like go deep on cool topics and so one thing i was pitching recently and that greg and i just spent a little time jamming on is sort of at the it's something you're going to understand because it's at the nexus of like cultural movements and sports um so you're familiar with the x games yep okay so the x games been around for now like i don't know what is it 25 plus years like it's been around since 1995 espn owned it for forever has languished they haven't you know they've kind of disney has gone in a different direction and they're not doing anything with it last year they basically tried publicly said they were trying to sell it and so initially they said it would cost 100 million to buy it no one wanted it they came down and they basically said they would take a 50 million dollar offer for the access for all the ipads together i want to create a day read my mind i want to create a dow to buy the x games you buy all the ip of the x games and basically completely reimagine the x games for a web 3 and crypto enabled world nft access special events athlete nfts so that they can further monetize and have and capture more of the value that they're creating with their social presence video games licensed peak is [ __ ] like skateboarding video games are rock and they were so tony hawk pro skater was so sick so an x games video game i think would be amazing with all the different sports sell the rights to the broadcast make it more of like an event series like ufc rather than just like two times a year like the olympics which you obviously participated and know about and just do so much more with the ip than i think what what disney was able to do and what you know what espn did um so what do you think um where am i wrong tell me like tell me why i'm being an idiot about this i don't think you're being an idiot about this i think people do the same thing when they're trying to buy michael jordan's old house sean courier those are like fractionalize that idea i think it was actually a really interesting i mean in terms like monetization i think there's some friction points there i think the idea in essence is still strong right like there's still a strong community that loves extreme sports um just like people love michael jordan as do i like had i known about that opportunity i probably would have come in much earlier just because i think it's cool to have like some piece of history about someone who i looked up to when i was a kid yeah um but uh i i think so here's an example that i thought of a long time ago so i think nbc you know who broadcasts and buys like they spend billions of dollars to have the access to the olympic games to broadcast them um i think that those numbers have been somewhat going down over time because the cultural shift is changing where i think the olympics is trying to figure out where it lives inside this next generation's like day and is it important and why is it important i think that conversation is kind of an important one but um something they did was they invested into snapchat and i i don't know what the amount was it might have been like 500 million bucks some like absurd amount of money that i thought it was crazy in hopes that that would attract the next generation of viewers and i thought i was like well why would they just give the money to a public company versus going directly to the creators themselves the top top 50 creators in the world right speak different languages and saying we're going to give you all access rights we're going to get a whole crew with you each and you're going to go experience an olympics like you've never even dreamed of doing we only ask that you broadcast this daily to your fans right and if they did that how much would that cost to get 50 people in the room to give them this incredible experience the creators themselves would love to do this because they're always looking for cool unique pieces of content nbc has never had an ability to counter to directly communicate and engage with an audience that they feel really really behind to so i i thought about that i was like why would they do that and i just figured out that like it's i mean it's obviously much harder to do but i mean that's what i would have done so like take that idea and then instead of going to the traditional broadcasting rights like go to the twitches go to the existing streaming networks and say like hey let's build like an entire like worldwide phenomena kind of like what sean white did with his kind of like what's called um air and style i think it's called um and then he sold it right to a chinese-based company so like i look at stuff like that and i'm like this is pretty it's pretty smart right so you can definitely create something it may not even have to be the x games but i think the branding is definitely an accelerative tool there uh i think it's cool man i do think so i think you're hitting on a lot of the things i've thought about with it too which number one i think you need to reinstall it in culture so you brought up that kind of culture that shifted away from it i see things like culture is now creating movements around all of these topics drive to survive what they did to formula one and viewership of formula one with that netflix show the secret sauce of that was they installed personalities behind the car so when someone's watching it's not a car anymore it's lewis hamilton right or it's max verstappen and you're watching and now you're like invested in that guy because you've seen him without his helmet on and you really see him and you could do that same thing like an x-games drive to survive or an x-games like queen's gambit did it with chess chess all of a sudden during covet became this cool thing why not go do something like that where you install personalities you played a somewhat esoteric sport or you competed in an esoteric sport but you were a huge personality you weren't probably able to in the way you could today profit from that as much if you had nfts if you had all these things that you know could have provided unique access giving you the tail of value associated with it today we live in a world where these athletes can they have huge social media followings a lot of like cult community followings that they could grow and build from and so you create some sort of show or ecosystem whether it's streaming or something unique that installs personalities behind it and then on the back of that give those athletes a way to monetize it to incentivize them to be a part of the new x games that we're creating and i think you could i mean 50 million dollars just doesn't feel like that much to me for something like this you could probably go sell the streaming rights to it for the games and finance part of the purchase price of it because espn's not going to do it so you can go do something with them but i i just have to believe there's a way with all these new tools we have to give the athletes a reason to do it to give fans a reason to want to come back and be involved in it i'm on the board of an action sports company fox racing which is this amazing motocross mountain bike business and the community and the fandom around it is insane people have tattoos of the fox logo on their bodies like that's a next level thing you see bumper stickers tattoos on their cpu you go to the races and people have like oh yeah check out my box tattoo and they show it to you it's nuts and so if you can channel that that's that's the crypto right i mean that's web 3 is community yeah i mean i think what we're not talking about here is that in sports and by the way preface it i'm like the most non-sports guy even though i did drain a couple of three pointers outside he did that's not on camera but someone saw it someone saw it right today fans don't have the ability to really have any say in professional sports like you like for example like baseball is how many games like a 162 it's 162. so boring and i bet you if fans had the ability to vote on that decision maybe they'd make it 62 instead of 162 or maybe they'd change it from nine innings to seven innings i don't know but giving them the ability to vote web 3 in a web 3 oriented way makes a lot of sense to me i think that the fundamental shift that's happening is that people especially younger people don't want to be passive consumers of stuff and that's why i think web3 3 is so interesting from like an entertainment and community perspective is if you could you know actually enable two-way conversation um great things could happen have you seen mad realities have you seen this new thing yes have you seen this no you'd be interested in this so it's um i don't you might have seen it when clubhouse happened there were these um group of women out of nyu that did like nyu chicks roasting tech bros i think was like the name of it it was this hilarious thing that went pretty viral shoot your shot yeah like they would come up and pitch something and it was like a dating thing sort of and it was very funny and they went very viral one of the women from it who i actually went to high school with incidentally has started this company called mad realities which is the first nft uh reality dating show and so anyone you and i can go buy an nft for a rose and then we can vote on the outcomes and actually drive the outcomes of this reality dating show that they're going to film in new york and it's kind of a cool version of exactly what you're saying and the application of that towards this x games idea could be cool you can involve fans in like who are you staking head to head in some event because now the personalities matter and you want your athlete to be going against someone you can kind of like pit people head to head i'm i'm meeting somebody on saturday who's raising a a series b basically a fan controlled community economy around sports that was really cool invest in it yeah yeah it's it's pretty cool yeah i'm seeing a lot more of it that's cool and i think that's the that's the shift right is going from like one single entity now saying like you know creator economy and then now you know like your fans should be actually voting and staking based upon what topics and direction that you guys are talking about how much time you spend who you shouldn't do next how you reach out to that person are they incentivized to and why i think that's where the concentration happens out on sports specifically i think that's going to happen a lot more i've seen many iterations of it on the kind of gaming side so like online kind of gambling side i've seen a lot of different kind of conversations around what sports looks like and how people can interact and so just i think that now we've got like the tools to really actually produce those things in real time and that's cool right like i don't know i mean it's never going to happen for the olympics right that's such a centralized controlled entity i mean at the beginning of this year in january i remember having a conversation with some friends of mine um and saying like hey like why don't we produce a dao to see and identify where the next olympic city should actually be held aside like a radically transparent way where communities and participants it's tough right because i think theoretically people don't usually vote when it comes like mass scale but what if they could and what if there was like an economic trail where you could see like hey this is going to benefit the local economy in a way that's really really beneficial and also this is really important from a societal perspective so that your daughter son whoever can see the impact of having olympic games here or maybe you don't think it's important maybe you don't want this here and you should have a say versus like six people who are controlling a particular entity so you were an olympic athlete yeah how many gold medals did you win two two gold medals insane gold medalist uh how would you reimagine the olympic games like if you could change things about the olympic games make them more athlete friendly make them more fan friendly like what would be the things that you would envision changing about that um that's a great question that's a long uh that's a long question i think i love the fact that like the world comes together um i i would like to just see more access right that's that's my biggest thing so nbc does a really good job of like providing like all different ways to consume the content like they're really good at that but i still think that they i mean it could always be improved right so like how do you get more people participating um it's it's a bit of a catch-22 right because the olympics as a whole as a business like if you take the uso c for the usopc the united states olympic and paralympic committee their business model is to generate metals which then in turn attracts sponsors so that they can continue their jobs and have trickle-down effect to supply the training and resources for olympic athletes that's the cycle that's the feedback loop right so it's tough when like we talk about like how what do we want to change because even like with mental health and sports today we want athletes to be open and vulnerable around how they feel um simone biles did something that was perhaps previously unthought of by dropping out of an olympic games i think it was four out of the five events she was competing in um and saying like hey this is i'm not okay this is not okay and then we saw the backlash of sensitivity around which polarization view you were taking as an individual saying hey i believe that my strongly held um you know conditioning says that you should act a certain way respond a certain way as an athlete because that's what i always believed in and i get that like that's how i was brought up right but then on the flip side there's a new era that says well she's still a human being i have no idea what she's actually going through why should my opinion of how she should represent herself actually come into play at all she's one in one individual person so like all these i think about all these different kind of fragments of what's happening in the olympic space and how much sports has changed and where it's going and why it's important but i say that because the cycle and the commercialization of the games is all-time high and they're just adding sports like esports will probably become an olympic sport at some point whether i believe that is valid or not it doesn't really matter right i think there's enough people play esports to say like it should be a sport and we should have some kind of control mechanisms around who should be crowned winner and receive a gold medal now like traditional stick and ball sports uh american sports we'll probably say like that's stupid we don't believe in it just like people will probably point to equestrian or curling and say that that is dumb hey i was on the curling team so i take personal offense to that trigger i had to be a part of a team sure in in high school yeah and it just felt like the easiest i mean i grew up in canada okay side story i can't believe i'm you know we can cut this out but nice or keep it in um but basically fun times biggest game of the year he like didn't he he was supposed to be it's harder than you think it's harder it's a cool sport but what i'm saying is like yeah because it doesn't replicate the athletic belief that i think should be going into like wrestling for example like to me wrestling is like one of the hardest portions right that's my conditioning and belief because i used to live with those guys i watched them train i know how crazy they are right and i learned a lot from them but then someone who plays chess like who it's not that much of a physical sport although it takes like a lot of mental brain power like you know someone might say like that's not a sport but it kind of really is right so i don't know we're just like what would i change about the games dude i changed so many things yeah i think that the uh i can't even give you the straight answers the uh the ability for the athletes what one of the things that like broadly bothers me about sports is it's a very short-lived career you have an extreme peak of your relevance and your fame and all of these things and the olympic athletes it's even shorter an olympic um gymnasts sometimes get two games but a lot of these olympic athletes the sprinters they get one game for the most part where they are like for three weeks a hero of their entire country and they are not able to capture that value for the long term and i do personally think like i know everyone always like the bitcoin fixes this web 3 fixes this i really do think there's an angle here where like michael phelps is an extreme example you're an extreme example but there are people where if they minted a hundred of their gold medal as an nft and you could own one of a hundred of whoever apollo's gold medal as an nft there are a lot of people that then like oh okay you get to go to an annual meetup or something and or you get on an ama and you get to chat with people if they have access to this ticketed events things like that with it it's sort of a cool way to like provide these athletes with more of a payback on all of the effort that they've put in for quite literally their entire lives to get to that point and i think that there's something beautiful there because so many of these athletes they're they're literally relevant for two three weeks and then they go back into anonymity and not able to profit from what has been an entire career of crazy sacrifice and like debilitating injury in a lot of cases so i've been having this conversation for years last year i started having conversations with the usopc around kind of reinventing the way that the distribution of payment to athletes has handled and how they can monetize their own branding so like with every influencer that's on instagram or tiktok or youtube or wherever the distribution channel is there's like ample ways to monetize that right um and audience is typically the number one way to do that whether it's your merchandise or whatever you're kind of selling and shilling it's great with olympic athletes it doesn't work that way so if you look at like nba top shop right they have the kind of athletes commissioner so to speak right um that controls effectively all the rights so all the athletes that are competing in the nba they almost like relinquish their rights because they're playing in the nba and they're paid like handsomely to do so but there is like a give and take there right and because the players association oversees all of their rights they can effectively work with what's happening with dapper or you know top shot or whoever the entities are that basically say hey like if these things are sold on our platform you basically are only receiving a fraction of what you normally would receive and then when you see someone like gronkowski go and do his own he scrubs the image of all the kind of likeness and ip and all these things does it have relevance does it have value what's happening the challenge of giving that context because with the olympic space you've got nbc you've got the ioc you've got the usopc you've got getty images you've got the individual athletes you've got the other athletes in the same race then you've got the individual sponsors that are also there and then you've got the ioc sponsors there so like i originally had this idea of saying like hey i want to go create a repository of all of the greatest historically significant olympic moments in time jesse owens right muhammad ali michael phelps like whatever you want to do right like tommy on the stand you know like holding his fist in the air like really historical significant moments in time and have them as a part of like a virtual intra real life museum like that should be here wynwood walls right is here's how you bring sports to an audience maybe that doesn't care about sports and you bring it through culture through music through politics whatever that is and i had this idea to create all these moments as nfts and then have like a museum and only like you could have like a proper museum like this in place like abu dhabi where like they're willing to pour like billions of dollars into this like cruelly cool like ar immersive experience um and the challenge that we had that i ran into very quickly was that the athletes actually don't own the rights to their own [ __ ] damn i was gonna say this sounds amazing a little over a year ago i started having this conversation and i was like really really hardcore because i was like look and then the way this benefits is like the the platform can take a small sliver right of the fee and then we can have the majority go towards the athletes or the athletes families or whatever the the entity or the estate or whatever it is or like some like organization that helps oversee also we could pocket like a side over here to say like 10 is going to go towards helping athletes transition beyond sport so that they can communicate to the world that they have extreme productivity they just need to be kind of given guardrails again outside of the olympic realm that's the biggest we talked about this when i saw you last was that like the reinvention for an athlete is this like closely held identity to one side and then all of a sudden there's this great divorce that happens and the identity that they love that was that they taught him everything i'm writing a book about this so i'm like i'm so passionate about it it tells them like you're no longer good enough i found someone younger who's better and no matter what you do you can't come back to me so you either go be a coach should be a part of the team somehow but you can no longer compete and be the star light star athlete again in the olympic space it's a very short window and so the athletes then like [ __ ] like what else am i good at what do i do like what skills do i have i've like pushed off school i pushed off social life i'm like this like very narrow isolated person that has incredible attributes underneath this layer but i've never really expressed them outside of leaning on the levers of like my fears of failure or like rage or you know like insecurities and self-doubts to prove myself in my sport because i could physically do that now i have to do that against if i'm trying to work in like web 3 or i'm trying to become someone who's a new creator i've got some 17 year old kid who's faster smarter or more experienced than i am and i'm 25 or i'm 26. so like there's this like uh letdown that happens and so i had this idea about creating all these little pockets of like i deeply believe in the value that athletes can bring to society and to to to economies because they do contain really cool life lessons that are usually taught later on in your life and they have them right out of the gate and the work ethic the discipline like the the being coachable all those things are natural they got punched in the face punch in the face many times but they need to be kind of molded and still held in the same way and mentored in a new environment in a new career and it's like really frightening and like very visceral in terms of the breakup that you have with that first identity and so like this nft platform or this like nft museum was like my my way of basically funneling this other idea around something that i cared about and it never took off and i i was like very sensitive around like pursuing a project um that i wasn't going to be able to spend like a ton of time on um who owns the rights the rights are owned by like a whole series of people so the ioc has like the ultimate say over what's happening but then the person who took the picture for getty images also has the rights um then the athletes that are also there also have a say and then the above the athletes is the u.s olympic committee body so that's like the u.s speed skating right the u.s olympic committee um yeah so it's so basically what i'm trying to say is it's really complex and it's convoluted and it should change because there's like a lot of value there like to me when i think about sports and like the pinnacle of achievement in the olympic space um it is quite unique right and whether you watch sports or not like there's something cool around someone dedicated an entire lifetime around a moment that lasts nine seconds or 40 seconds and in that moment of time whether you're in a saint bolt or michael johnson or michael phelps or whoever that person is like the difference between first and like being off the podium is like fractions like hundreds of seconds and because it's like that what happens that person who's in fourth who's in fifth i watched this like really cool documentary i think it was a bbc documentary on the only person who beat floyd mayweather and it's just i think it's i want to say it's this guy who's somewhere in like eastern europe and it showed the two dichotomies of lifestyle difference you got floyd right it's like crushed it like super flashy like all you know like money money mayweather you've got this other dude who like lives in this like localized town that looks like it's been bombed like 10 times and he's like known but he's like had like his own bouts of like depression and issues associated and he was a celebrated hero in his hometown because he won a medal right in his in his for his home country and i just think about that stuff all the time and like why do two different like people go down different roads it's typically because they've been celebrated by one i'm very lucky dude like i know that i'm very grateful because i was chosen by nbc to be a spotlighted athlete but why me just because i was winning there's like other people who in the olympic space that have crazy cool stories that you've never heard about and i know because i live with these guys in the olympic training center like coming out like you know being like imagine being olympic gold medals i'm gonna say the person's name but winning a gold medal for like a really hard sport and then retiring for like 10 years uh going and living your life getting married having kids then falling into depression and then having like a drug problem and then losing your family losing your kids no longer have access losing your job you have nothing and then coming back to the sport because the sport is the only place that you've found that gives you some semblance of feeling important or some sense of like purpose in some capacity and then the first match that you have against the number two in the world you beat him after 10 years it's like really cool right um i have no idea where that guy is now but i remember sitting in this like olympic training center and seeing like an unfamiliar face that could definitely could tell he had been through some [ __ ] in his life and then sitting down with this dude and being like dude like what's up man like i've seen your picture in the halls in the training center because you're a legend but where have you been the past 10 years i mean like just for like three hours tells me his life story i'm like [ __ ] no one has told this story like why is nbc not commenting on this so but that's the power of streaming and that's why you guys can bring cool people here it is just the i have so many thoughts on that i mean i've as a former athlete on a completely different scale than you but i played at a high level in college sports we were the number one team in the country a number of times and i think about the thing you said about a few seconds feels like a light you've spent your entire lifetime preparing for a few seconds gives me chills thinking about that because i have a moment like that in my career where it was one game and i was out there and i had to get the last out of this game and it was a big crowd and it was a huge game and i think i thought about that while i was out there like holy [ __ ] i've literally my entire from little league the first t-ball field i was on to like this moment this is it and it's either gonna go one way and like this guy's going to hit a 800 foot home run off me and we're going to lose or it's going to go the other way celebrating i just was sitting there and i was like and i was it was like a 2-0 count on the guy was a pitcher and i remember thinking like am i really going to walk this guy we're going to lose like this is it my entire life of like training for this moment that's what i'm gonna do and it went the it went a good way luckily i ended up it was a celebratory moment but that transition you talk about and the mental health of athletes and the ability to manage that transition the lack of resources to help them manage that transition i mean i've had i'm sure you know hundreds of people like it sounds like you're writing a book about it which i'll eagerly look forward to i've had one of my best friends in the world was and i don't think he'll mind me saying this he's one of the most talented baseball players i've ever seen on a field um he was a first overall pick in the mlb draft like got paid six million dollars insane one of the most talented people ever has not made it to the mlb was called the biggest bust in mlb history in mlb draft history and dealt with serious struggle as a result of that just like defining who you are because it was for your whole life driven around this one persona who you are and he's br and i've had to spend hours talking to him you're brilliant you're an amazing person it had nothing to do with baseball that was one iteration of it but there's a whole new life out in front of you and we don't do a good job having the resources to actually tell those people that like the things you learned and the lessons you learned weren't so that you could go throw a ball or so you could skate quickly or so you could wrestle well it is so broadly applicable to what you're going to go do next but we don't have institutions resources to go have that conversation with those people at that next level and it's it's not just olympians or professional athletes like think of um you know u.s veterans or or veterans in general like failed startup founders there's millions of veterans who come out come out of training and and service and [Music] they're like okay like what next and then they fall into depression and they fall into you know a lot of dark places but they you know like you know training for the olympics or like training for uh you know high-level sports they've got they're rooted in a lot of um great skills it's just how do how do we transform those people into the into the real world i know there's some people trying um there's organizations right yeah i think these are all a lot of this is like psychological on a lot of its conditioning you know i think a lot of people when they come home from service they probably feel alien less appreciated like no one knows what they did what they went through and no one can relate because that's how i felt right i felt like you don't you have no idea what it took i wasn't even genetically gifted in my sport like i had to go to places like you don't even know about like that was my thought right um and so we absolutely need like real transitory like just transition mechanisms to help a lot of these people because uh they're powerful man but like i think people go through this all stage in your life everyone has to reinvent and pivot at some point you know like when i finish the book which i like when's it coming out what's the book called it comes out in february it's called hard pivot okay and it just talks about like i think our all of our human struggle with reinvention adaptation to uncertainty um and how to how did i figure out kind of my own personal way as i'm figuring it out and just like kind of transparently give like some tool kits some things that i've had to go through both on a personal development level where my own micro traumas have come from um and all these things right like i grew up in a single parent household where you know my father was japanese i'm i'm half japanese and he had like extremely high expectations for me right so very tiger father driven like amazing love like super lucky to have this but also like no matter how bad i failed he was like oh like you can always you can always pick yourself back up no matter how i even if i won it was always better so like that like level of fear of effectively letting down the one person that i sought the most love from my life which was my dad was like deeply rooted at a very early age and so it drove everything that i did everything like everything was always i think and i didn't know this too much later in my life but i think a lot of people go through that process of like the micro traumas and the experiences that we've had as kids in school relationships through work they affect you unless you deal with them in some capacity and that's why like during the beginning of the pandemic like 18 months ago i was like man like not only athletes are going through this i think a lot of people are going through this and there's got to be a better way um it's never easy but at least if we can embrace parts of this journey and know that it's not easy and know that there's perhaps a different avenue for us to grow like at least it makes life a little bit less like sisyphus you know what i mean yeah where it's just so painful to like always go back down again and i don't know and finding the communities to have that outlet to talk about it with peers because i always find these things are built up in your mind more than they're real like for me that pivot away from baseball i was hurt it was very clear to me abundantly clear to me that my career was over and that i needed to hang it up and the hardest conversation you bring up your dad the hardest call in conversation was to call my dad and tell him and i still i mean i still think about it and feel like emotional thinking about it when i called him and i was like dad you're gonna be so disappointed that i'm having to hang it up and he didn't care at all he was just like you've accomplished so much i'm so happy you know that you feel that you need to call me but there was no like these people love you and you have so much support out there and you we need to create systems where people realize that that there is that support that you have that community right like the team rallies around you the people that you've trained with your whole career rally around you but you need to not be afraid to seek that out because when people go inward and you just retreat into the shell that's when you end up with the real struggle i found when you're when you're able to just say like hey i'm really sad about this i'm having to change and make strongest prison is right between your two years oh that's great like it literally is yeah you can have the most and we see this with like crypto and web3 and everything that's being created today like it's the most powerful tool in the world it's also like the most damaging tool if it's used against you in the wrong way and i lived in that space for a long time like many athletes do where like you are literally your own worst enemy and if you listen to that voice that tells you often that you're not good enough and it's not good enough and it's never going to be good enough you're not tall enough you're not attractive enough you're not smart enough and other people have more than you and you know like that's a really like uh confusing and also can be really really um i think just destructive you know and you can sabotage yourself and i think that you know i i for years used that as a lever to like get me up early and keep me up late at night it was a very motivating tool but it also kept me like in a little bit of my own prison in a sense like where i wasn't fully able to accept myself and also love myself for my own inconsistencies and self-doubts and beliefs and just like being human right it was i wanted to be a machine and uh that's the uh that's the scary part for me about web3 and crypto like the dark side of it is you know it's a financialization of everything and everything is liquid and while that has a lot of benefits it also means you you're playing a game and you're playing as [ __ ] mccormack calls it the great online game and you want a high score and you're just it's 24 7. it's not like the markets that close on holidays or the weekends and there's a public score card it's a publix everyone sees it everyone sees it so i think you know for people playing in the game the people listening like set your own goals and it's f it's great to like hit milestones but i think that you know there's gonna be a burnout i predict a burnout uh and i'm already starting to see some individuals that are just they're taking it too far yeah it's uh but i'm talking to a you know a two-time gold medalist you're looking at like a one-time jump shot not even bronze medalist in curling it's funny there's levels to it right you just we all struggle with the same things just in different ways and iterations i do think athletes it's a very very i'm so excited for your book because i have so many friends i went through it personally i'm super excited for it i'm like share it with a lot of friends because i think colleges should be sharing that type of context with their athletes ncaa had all those commercials like 99 won't be going professional we'll be going professional in something other than sports and for some reason we didn't hear that message in college enough and i i mean i went to one of the best sports schools in the world and we didn't hear that message and so many of my friends were feeling lost after i felt lost there were times when i was like how am i going to have done this and like accomplish what i feel like i've accomplished and not have a job or not be able to go make use of the skills i feel like i've developed and now i have a lot of friends who've gone and played a few years professionally in whatever sport football baseball and they're like holy hell if the rest of my life and they might have made i have friends who have made 80 80 million dollars playing football or whatever it is and now they're like well [ __ ] i'm 28 and yeah i have a ton of money but like i have a whole life to live i need to find some reason to get up in the morning it doesn't matter if i have a lot of money um those transitions are just so hard it doesn't matter the money doesn't fix it on your point with like the burnout and there for sure is an incredible unique opportunity that is existing right now in in in all online activity whether it's crypto whether you're jumping in you're being a creator or you're trying to develop a community economy like whatever the iteration is that you are latching yourself onto i think something to make really important for anyone who's building things in the space where yes there's a small window of opportunity and i'm i'm definitely never one to tell you not to jump out of the airplane with no parachute because there's a lot of power in burning the ships so to speak but also you can't have so much external abundance in your life but then be in like severe internal poverty and if that is what's happening where if you're a trader in crypto and it requires you to be so glued to your devices all the time and if you can't disengage for periods you're you're actually no better off than the guy who's working 18 hour shifts like you're exactly the same your number on the scorecard is just slightly different but your life is the same there's nothing that's inherently different so like again like i get it right like everything needs to like in sports we use the gas principle and in tech you know you go through like short sprints and you know you go through sprints right okay the next two weeks the next week the next six weeks is going to be a sprint everyone hands on deck it's going to be not balanced at all and i think that is important but i also think it's important to be able to disengage and also be present right because this this race of what's happening in in web 3 in the development it's we're like at the tip of the iceberg like where we're heading in the direction that it's going and the opportunities that exist on the other side are the ready player ones like that is literally what we are creating in many iterations and if you are participating in this in some way to reinvent reimagine and um just just change the way that we think about our values between each other between the different games that we're playing between the content that you're producing and consuming between the financialization of products um i always ask myself like why does this need to exist at the end of the day like this is this actually really important and if it is amazing if it's not then i'm still playing the game so you know like like i've done so much like personal deep work and especially like the past like i would say eight years on like why do i act the way that i do why do i operate the way that i operate what am i chasing what do i believe life wants for me and what do i actually really want out of life are those things aligned in some capacity and then i sometimes find myself still being the hamster in the cage right just running running now at least now i know that i'm the hamster i know that i am still on the treadmill and at times we just have to get off you know and so like right now we're doing this at art basel and it's the most insane thing that i've seen in years we kind of talked about that earlier right like you showed me your calendar yep and i almost puked and and i say that with like i i i feel i felt for you because i was like i think that you shouldn't go to you have two through two how many dinners two to three dinners four dinners four dinners tonight they're all at the same time yeah i don't know like what's the yeah and humans should have one dinner and [Laughter] i don't think enough people are hearing that message everyone's hearing the message around and by the way i'm the biggest like the future is web3 the future is creator the future is community person and i also don't sleep a lot so i you know but at the same time i i pull myself out of it and i'm like do i really need to do this right now or can i go and play the guitar or whatever or go and just go for a walk in the park or go do things that are quote-unquote mundane can i ask you something about that because i i think that's i think it's really profound and interesting that you're saying that do you feel more free do i feel more free when i when you're able to tap into that yes i've learned that from him and what does the freedom give you like in terms of i think of two things right fomo and fopo right fomo we know of that exists everywhere in especially in crypto fopo is like fear of other people's opinions which is sometimes directly correlated with fomo do you feel none of that i feel i mean i'm a human being so i do feel some of that um but i think i've trained myself to not care what people think and just do you know we were just talking about this this right before where i was yeah i was wearing this t-shirt and it said snowden deli on it which is this jewish deli that was like right next to my place growing up and i wore it to like a famous person's new york fashion week party and this like well-known hip-hop artist came up to me and he said are you wearing a jewish delis t-shirt to a new york fashion week party and i was like i guess i am because i'm here you know and it's like and he couldn't believe it right it was like celebrities everywhere and everyone was dressed in and i think that the freeing part of it is you have yeah do to answer your question do i feel free i feel free when i when i'm able to do what i want to do isn't that the definition of freedom yeah it's awesome i by the way i love that you do that exercise i think it's really important for all of us to go through that process um i think there's times when we when we when we we decide not to we say okay this is i believe this is important or maybe i don't believe it's important but i'm gonna do it anyway and it doesn't mean you can't work hard right like i now you gotta work hard you gotta work hard pre-requisites yeah right like you got to work hard and like when i'm working i'm working right like i'm all i'm dialed but when i'm not i'm not that yeah that i mean i i think about that is like just being like really just authentic man if you can be authentic to yourself and then kind of catch yourself at least be more mindful of kind of your own internal emotional thoughts that are pulling you or directing you in certain ways maybe that don't directly are in alignment with your true north of what the ultimate goal here is or what the next chapter is in your life like it's it's hard to have that perspective ongoing because we do buy into the external signaling of society telling us what we should have what you should be doing which dow you should be participating in which new token launch you should have which new game you should be participating which new play to earn learn to earn whatever it is um and when you're not you're less than yep right and that's the biggest issue here is like because you're not in the club because you didn't get in at this round or because you didn't buy it at this price you're less than you're less than smart you're not you don't have as much access you're not in the club and those things are true right maybe in some instances but they're also just like made up so iron man it's a i think it's like an age-old conundrum that we are facing right is like how to balance i think psychologically between what we know to be externally signaling to us as the new wave of this conditioning is happening which is to be con you know connected 24 7 all the time and always available and always ready um versus like still being human and then like balancing that it's tough yeah i mean it's funny it's like i'm in between you two sort of on this where i came from a sports background and i had the like very similar mentality that i think you had from what i've read about your background and listen you speak about it i was just like complete balls to the wall like i'd wake up at four go to bed at you know 11 like i had to work harder than anyone else because i knew i wasn't that talented and i was just like i just have to work harder than everyone and i took pride in that and it was like this deep i almost had a bitterness about the fact that i wasn't talented and that drove me like you were better than me but like [ __ ] you i'm gonna like just do better than you because i'm working harder and i took pride in that and then i took a job in traditional finance and that was like a great breeding ground for that mentality where if you just worked harder and you worked more hours you were like okay that was you took pride in how many hours you worked 100 hour week it was like oh great you're doing this and now i'm like in this sort of new world where i'm getting to do more creative things and i'm sort of able to work more like a lion than like a than like a cow to use the naval thing of like more in sprints and real creativity and trying to drive things forward and it's important to how i think for me to actually be able to think clearly and not be foggy all the time because i haven't slept and so i'm somewhere in the middle of that transition now of like i still have that deep-seated feeling of like being an underdog and wanting to go figure these things out neither my parents were in finance like i want to go make money and do a bunch of cool things and like make my parents proud my mom's indian i come from a mixed race background as well and you know indian parents it's like the old thing of like why you're not why you not doctor or like why are you not you know now it's like why you not ceo of big tech companies like all the ceos now but i still have that but i'm trying to like fight against it to some extent to adopt more of these things but the secret is if you end up having in this new world that we live in which is like creativity based like we're creators right we're creating in order to be a great creator you need to have balance like that's what you're going to go on that walk and you're it's going to hit you hey i should you know i just had an idea for a startup i got to go launch it or hey like you know you're you're playing tennis or something and like something hits right with that so i think like the more out like the more hours to a certain point like it's a lot of diminishing returns and like i think people need to figure out what that is for them is it 35 is it 45 a week is it 50 is it 70 and like pick something that's less than 100 ideally and uh and like i like how you put it right be a human like i feel like that's a good thing to end on right like just what makes you happy man we're all on like a rock hurtling through the universe in space like we're all going to die and so like i just i think it's so fun that we get to have conversations with really smart people and get to meet people on a daily basis that are working on cool things that motivates me to want to work a lot it's cool because i can go and have conversations with smart people this week you're here you're meeting all these people part of what's motivating about that for you i imagine it's like there's a bunch of cool people that are building the future and you get to go have conversations with them and be a part of that and that's [ __ ] cool no matter how you slice it that's a cool thing to be in it you're in i mean we call this where it happens it's like being in the room where it happens that's what we all want to do we all want to be a part of it and that's like the brilliance of all of this and why i feel so lucky i also think it's a great place to cut off our time here because i know we're up against the end so yeah man that was uh thanks for having me that was awesome so excited where can people find you so i know we have pivot coming out in february hardcover coming out in february where can people follow you on social you know i'm on ig uh i don't post a ton if i'm on twitter obviously yep um the only apology out there i'm not on tick tock i don't do snap okay um but i think twitter's probably the best place yep um to communicate yeah awesome well thank you so much and tribe crypto um doing amazing things so excited to see what you guys built awesome team yeah it is an awesome team i can definitely vouch for that super exciting thank you so much man real real honor wow um that was far-ranging i felt like we covered i mean he sat with us for a lot longer than i thought so we ended up getting to a whole lot of stuff which was crazy to me by the way just like it's not a takeaway but getting to sit down with a guy that i've admired as long as that who's become a friend just super cool life moment for me so i'll let you go first what was your one big takeaway i mean i'm impressed with i mean i'm impressed with you about this too you and him is just the ambition and and how you you guys are like machines like you there's something about sports and professional sports that just teaches you really really uh to push it to the limits and i admire that but there are is also some downsides and we talked about it and i i think uh i think that push and pull is healthy but i i really enjoyed that yeah i mean you've pushed me to think a lot on those things and it's made my life better so i'm like i'm thankful for that personally that i have a counterpoint to like be a sparring partner to help me kind of ease up on things a bit so they appreciate it so the takeaway for everyone listening really is just uh don't push yourself too hard yeah and also push yourself well it's hustle but no one to rest yeah you gotta know when to rest it's like work like a lion yeah you gotta sprint when you're sprinting and really focus but then know when to rest and like a lion knows when to sleep after it sprints and then i can't leave this episode without my one big takeaway which is i love this idea of buying the x games and i like i'm gonna sing it from the rooftops i want to go do this and if it's still literally on the block for 50 million dollars i think we could do it i think there's a massive opportunity here like enormous opportunity for the x games so if anyone's interested we're going to jump into discord wag bxg we're going to buy the x games four sigmatic is the secret sauce behind the where it happens podcast you know how much i've been talking about that hot cocoa the one that's jam-packed at the reishi mushrooms it absolutely has been transforming my mornings i have it at night completely chills me out takes out all my stress and allows me to have a good night's rest after those long days of tequila on the set i'm sure that's helpful i mean it does help the sweet vanilla plant-based protein is the one that i've been going to after my workouts in the mornings it's been a game changer 18 grams of plant-based protein adaptogens jam-packed with mushroom goodness it's been a complete game changer for me so to go check it out go to 4sigmatic.com and use code the room at checkout greg why do you look so tired i look so tired because i did not sleep last night have you never slept well or is this a new thing it's not that i can't fall asleep i fall asleep like right away but i wake up a couple hours later and i'm just sitting in my bed and i look at the ceiling and i can't fall back asleep and i don't know what to do so i was literally you and for the longest time i was this like hustle culture bro sleep when i'm dead didn't want to sleep didn't care about my sleep and then i honestly i started reading more of the research and realizing how impactful sleep is to your longevity to your health all of these other things and as part of that i found eight sleep which has completely revolutionized the way i sleep i've heard of eight sleep can you tell me more about it think of it as like the future of sleep all of these mattress companies have created these mattresses they're just stuck they're stock mattresses eight sleep is technology plus sleep combined so the whole product is built around optimizing the temperature that you sleep at and so you read about sleeping cold is the key to sleeping and it's not quite true everyone has a different optimal sleep temperature and it changes throughout the night which is the crazy part about it so you might need really cold to fall asleep and then you might need it to be a little bit warmer to keep you

that much time what are we drinking yeah what are we drinking ah all right well it is 10 a.m so i feel like a little bit of a degenerate here we've got a hibiki japanese whiskey today are you a japanese whiskey i love japanese whiskey i'm gonna pour you a little bit it's okay let's get myself a sticker okay so you're saying that you you know you get the stiffer pour and i'm a lighter guy look at you man you're six nine 135. cheers well i'll drink to that i'll drink that that's good it's pretty good it's light it's a good taste it's smoky it's very smoky yeah yeah it's good um so i've got an idea i want to run by you today okay what do you got um it's related to this whole thing that's happening in the world that's changing with the home economy okay you know like airbnb happened i don't know i honestly have no idea when airbnb started 10 years ago say it's a 100 billion dollar company now massive business everybody's like doing the whole home sharing thing it became this you know it became this reality now you have covid happens all these people leaving the cities buying new houses especially young people so this whole new generation of homeowners like you know 24 to 30 year olds going and buying new houses interest rates at the floor so it's almost free to go buy a house have all these new home owners but there's a huge issue that's happening with it what's the issue so if you're like me you have no freaking idea what it takes to actually manage a home you have a house i do have a house i just got a new house my biggest issue with the entire process it's not like buying the house it's not mortgage like all that i get it it's kind of a pain in the ass but the reality of it is like the gutters what the hell do i do with gutters in my house i don't know when they have to get cleaned i don't know like air filters all of this random stuff that is around the house that i'm supposed to know how to fix as an adult like our generation we never learned that stuff it wasn't like we sat in schools or parents taught us these things like i knew how to mow the lawn and do some basic stuff around the house but the reality is most of these things our generation has no clue how to manage i mean i live in miami in miami and i just found out that you have to change your ac filter once a month literally once a month ac filters i don't even know where they are yeah i do not know i had a house in california owned it for 18 months never changed the ac filter once and when we moved out it was one of the things when the buyer was buying the house of like how often have you changed the ac filters and i had no clue what to say dude i was literally on youtube like how to change an ac filter and i'm watching like these youtube videos i don't know when how you know i'm like embarrassed i'm like embarrassed to call my parents and be like how do you change an ac filter yeah so yeah so tell me what's the idea what do you think okay so first off there's two ideas that you one just that you sparked for me someone needs to do like some sort of paid newsletter youtube something that just like teaches you how to be an adult because i have no clue how to be an adult and we don't learn anymore like there's all this random stuff that happens but okay here's my idea and i want to pitch you on it i want you to tell me if it's stupid too okay because like i'm super high on it i want someone to start it if it's not me and i'm gonna go fund it so all these young people moving out buying houses when you're young and you live in a city we're in new york right now if you have an apartment in the city and you're living in an apartment when something goes wrong there's just a portal there's like a website you log into for the building and you go type in what your issue is you have ants say you find dance you go type in hey i got ants the next day you go to work someone has shown up and fixed this for you you literally just had someone that came in and while you're gone an exterminator showed up and fixed it because the building has some provider and they deal with it and there's a portal and you have like your owner your home manager that basically just does that through this portal that does not exist for home ownership and i've looked into it i've tried to find it for myself literally doesn't exist there's no central body central authority where you can just have someone that runs all of these things for you so break down to me like how it would work like how much money would it cost what would you get out of it so here's walking through it yeah so what i want is a home manager like i literally want a concierge who runs my entire household and i don't i mean it in terms of like both the proactive stuff like we talk about ac filters gutter cleaning uh i don't know like lawn landscaping if you end up having a pool like pool person all these things are proactive that you know you have to do once every three months you just have to go do them i need that done i also want reactive if i have ants if i find cockroaches in my house i need someone to show up asap i'm not i mean my wife's not messing around with that kind of thing neither am i actually i'm actually more scared of bugs than she is but if i have something like that i need someone to show up right then and i don't want to have to spend all the like energy and stress figuring out in my new town who is the best ant guy that's not going to overcharge me or like a sewage backup who's the best plumber that's going to show up and do this so you need both the proactive and the reactive and i think what you do is you set up a business where you basically say we're going to charge like it's like an amazon prime model charge you making up a number 500 bucks a month and that is just to have access to this service and then basically you get access to via this service all of their primary providers that get you all of these things so you have someone that's automatically coming and cleaning your gutters doing the filters doing the like monthly or quarterly checkups that you need done and then also if something ever goes wrong and you need the like reactive asap sunday night sewage backup emergency you can plug it into the portal and you have your single point of contact your concierge that just shows up and they will go get the person for you you know big angie's list is as a business it's like it's billions right yeah is it owned by isc or is that a separate business i don't know all i know is it's big it's insane it's old school so are you are you talking about like basically a modern-day angie's list that you know is more curated you know what i mean i haven't thought about angelus it's an interesting one to point out so i've experienced angie's list uh my experience with it is that it sucks my experience with it is that you go like i was trying to find someone to clean our house and i went and plugged in information on the house whatever and basically what happened was i got a bunch of spam calls because they just i don't know if they sell out your data or if they just farm you out for quotes but basically you end up with a hundred people contacting you sending you quotes doing all this stuff and the quality of it is just not controlled you might have the reviews on the site and stuff but it's not the concierge experience that i think young people want i just think our generation what makes me so excited about this idea is that our generation is used to curated concierge-like experiences and we're willing to pay for it in general and i think you could just like price tear something out depending on where it was and depending on the level of the offering where people would pay i mean i would gladly pay for just a single person that i knew i could contact to handle anything is this a rich person's problem like is this one of those business ideas that are is just going to be for wealthy people and not for regular people the first time i thought of it it's a good question i think it's a fair question i think it would crush it in really wealthy markets like if you went to the hamptons where i said i'm going to do this and i'm going to charge 2 000 a month for people and it's like their second homes that probably exists if i were to guess i would guess that the second home version of this exists and there's people in um there's people in the hamptons that do this i think the most interesting thing and the most interesting way to pursue this would actually just be to go to like home builders and do it in the mass markets where you have a home builder like a richmond american or like a toll brothers and they're building 500 houses in one area you go to them as a sales strategy and say hey you offer this for free for one year you pay us but you offer it for free as a sales incentive for one year and all of your customers are going to be on it they're going to love it they're going to value it at some amount or it looks like you're giving them something and now i get a ton of customers i'm super happy your people that just bought your houses are super happy because they're getting this amazing service really quickly i think it's really cool dude i have an idea okay what if you cut in the ho the home builders into the deal yeah that's the idea right yes you give them like i don't know 10 points on it for a year two years three years it's basically what you're saying is basically like hoa like homeowners what's that homeowners association i think that's it right association for you know homes right so it's like that 500 a thousand dollars a month yeah and then you're just like okay homebuilder you're about to you know build this whole community of 500 homes a thousand homes yeah give them some incentive yeah and it's just like additional revenue for them i i totally i like that i like that piece too yeah i think it's just like the the idea that people will pay so much money to not have stress when you think about like as a business and you're launching a business you're trying to solve a customer problem fundamentally it's like what problem am i solving and what are people willing to pay to have that problem solve for them the problem here is stress i don't want to have to think about all these things on a weekly basis and right now i do right now if someone comes to me and says like oh your gutters whatever there's something wrong we had a sewage backup brand new house we got this brand new house and a sewage backup on a sunday night at 6 00 pm and that is the worst headache you could possibly have you're about to go into the week and there's something there's stinky water all over the basement like it's a terrible experience and i don't know who to call i'm like google searching how to find a plumber right now it's a pain and so to just have someone that you know you can text or call and it could be like a fake portal but it's literally a sas business that i think you just have services tied on to and so if you like really went down the rabbit hole on it i think what you do as the company is you have this 500 a month or whatever it is a pure profit coming into the system you take that and you go to all these service providers in the different regions and you say we're going to pay you 20 above what you get on a market rate because we have all this profit coming in we're going to pay you way more but you have to be on call for us and so if you get a call from whatever this company's called you're turning down everything else and coming straight to our place because then you effectively guarantee capacity within a region which is so critical to this model like i need it to be the case that i'm paying this 500 a month that person shows up right now when i go and call okay so let's just say you wanted to do this idea yeah like how do you get it done like where do you start you know like um what's your what's your thinking like so that yeah there's two approaches to this type of thing i think you could go the like vc-backed extravaganza you go and try to raise a ton of money and go blow it out nationally i think the more interesting way to do something like this candidly is to go ultra regional and say i'm going to start this in westchester county making up a place could be wherever it could be marin in california it could be i'd probably start in an area that either had a lot of home builder density or it had a lot of affluent um affluent people and basically say okay i'm gonna start there i'm gonna build out because the key thing with this it's like it's an operations challenge you have to build out the provider capacity really really quickly and sign them up to these type of deals because without that like you can build the whole portal you can have it look nice it looks fancy it's sexy it's great but if it doesn't work with actually getting the providers out when you need them out there it just doesn't function but i think it's like an operations challenge i think you really just need to get these pockets of regional density and you can expand pretty quickly because it's profitable from day one so would you do the vc model or do you think you'd sort of bootstrap it yeah get one city like to me it feels like this is one of those businesses that i read on like techcrunch that like raises you know goes from like it goes from zero to you know billions really quickly yeah so if it's a billion dollar business i should not be here right now and i should go start this um i think so i would probably go with start regional do one region prove it out because i think it's cash flow positive from day one i think you could go sign up if you went talk to 10 providers in that area and then went and signed up 100 households paying 500 a month i mean it's immediately profitable business where you're making a bunch of cash that's coming in day one because it's a monthly thing and by the way like the way i would do it is that 500 is just the cost of doing business as a customer you're not actually you still have to pay if a plumber shows up or you still have to pay if someone shows up you're just paying it's like amazon prime you're paying for the right to have this single point of contact this to me sounds like an idea potentially that's really good on paper but is really really hard to execute why do you think it's hard to execute dude like you have to call you have to have like minimal viable service providers right so you have to have an exterminator you have to have a pool person you have to have like you have to go to each vertical vertical and just like sign these people up and i'm wondering like if i was trying to start this because i actually think it's a good idea but if i was trying to start this i would just maybe maybe just focus on like you don't want to have mice or ants in your in your house like pay 500 300 a month 200 a month whatever it is and we'll take care of it like what like why don't you prioritize like this is my product hat here i'm like okay what are the two three four five things that people need the most yeah like the big you know you call it the stressors right like what are what's the big stresses that people have as homeowners in westchester that you can basically bundle to a 500 a month program so you would cut down the atomic unit to being like sitting within the actual product level yeah with a single vertical of type of people yeah sorry not a type of people a single vertical of service that's being provided like extermination or extermination sounds like a bad way of saying that you know what i mean getting rid of ants right extermination extermination of the rodents or whatever you have in your house okay so you would cut it down to that level see because i would just i think you have to go broad-based with it well i think a lot of people have ideas and like this is like one of those ideas that like yeah it like makes complete sense but it's then like sitting down executing it's an ops problem it's an ops problem no doubt yeah i think if you but if you found an amazing ops person to go do this you could go do it i'm pretty and i'm pretty sure it could be a profitable business within a single region and you could run it as like a few million a year business in a small region and be in a great spa how does this idea fail um if you fail on the ops piece of it if you are like if you fail to find a good person to actually consolidate and manage the relationships with the providers so it's not actually a good experience for the customer then i think you completely fail i flip it on its head though like i go with this whole idea of the reverse test i saw this framework recently it's like the reverse test which basically says if something were to start working in this way would you ever go back to the prior way that you did this and for me this totally passes the reverse test where i think if i had this and i could pay 500 a month and someone just took all of my headaches of home ownership away because i had a single point of contact would i ever go back to the prior way of doing it for free absolutely not actually i i think first of all i love that yeah it's a great frame it's a great framework the other thing is the other framework that you kind of were talking about which is like how to come up with startup ideas is one way to do it is you put this lens as to what are people's stressors in every in everyday life right and you start with an archetype so you're like the 30 year old you know new yorker who lives in westchester like what are the stressors that they have today and how do i come up with ideas to like deal with that yeah like that's like i feel like people don't do that enough it's one of the best ways of coming up with startup ideas is like talk to your uber driver right about what stresses them out what part of running your business as an uber driver stresses you out is it getting cash quickly well all these businesses started literally to fix that because people were getting money every other week and so there was businesses that started right you can go on reddit and just like look up things endlessly for what's stressing people out it's a really really cool way of figuring out ideas i feel i feel like people like people don't go into uber's enough and just like dude i take a you should take an uber every day and just like ask them questions it's like mark your research you spend spend 10 bucks on an uber and be like hey like what's stressing you out like what's going on it's one of the best ways of learning is just talking to random people that you meet on a daily basis it's like the ultimate intellectual curiosity to me is actually just going and talking to these people and seeing what you end up learning about their lives how they run their life how they run their business etc it's pretty amazing cool so what do you what are you thinking about this business you you know you doing it or i do i think it's sick yeah i'm not gonna lie i mean i've been i've been riffing on this for like three months and i either want to fund someone to go do it so if there's someone in our community that has an interest in pursuing this i seriously think i would be interested in funding it especially if you have a good ops guy to run it i'm all in on this um if not i might go do something like this i don't know how much time it would take and you'd have to find a good ops person but i think it's pretty interesting i here's okay i'll tell you what i like about it i'll tell you what i don't like about it yeah i like what i like about it it's like that uber model yeah right like start in one city start with like you know uber i'm sure you know like it started black cars san francisco right then they're like okay uberx then they're like okay uber pool then they're like okay food delivery and then they're like neo let's go to new york let's go to london let's go you know i love that you're stealing my whole road map right now i'm sorry dude you know but i think that's what it is it's the uber playbook right you're tr you're basically saying i want to do the uber playbook but for home sharing and i love that because vcs love that vc see that and they're like okay scalable i'm in and so i love that piece about it what i don't like about it is i feel like i hate to like put you on the hot spot man but i feel like you haven't like you haven't picked your community you haven't picked your vertical you have to start like maybe like your homework should be like should i focus on westchester right like i feel like if uber would have started in pa you know in paris or london um as uberx yeah it wouldn't have worked yeah so like the starting point in product building is so key yeah so i love this idea i think it's really interesting i like your pushbacks i think we should bring someone in to hammer us on it a little bit more all right let's bring in sam to jam on this we've got our friend sam parr joining us sam is a bunch of things he started a multi-million dollar media company that you sold you're the co-host of one of the most popular podcasts on the air my first million also a property owner and someone who's experienced a lot of the troubles that i'm talking about here so sam just to bring you up to speed really quickly what we're talking about is this idea i have for a home concierge business so it's basically this idea that young people have no idea how to manage anything in their house we weren't raised to understand any of the things about being an adult so i would much rather pay someone 500 a month to handle all of it for me have a portal where they deal with all sorts of air conditioning gut or whatever but also someone that i can immediately call to fix ant problems sewage backups whatever it is that's going on so we want to get your take on this as someone who has dealt with a lot of things within home ownership etc um let's just jam on it there was this company that was doing that for offices that i used to use was it called alfred right yeah hello alfred basically if i remember correctly i used it for my office um when we owned offices in san francisco and austin and it was basically like a platform where you logged in and all your vendors were on there and i could really easily organize who that is and i could like hire them to come do stuff i think you could do that for your home one thing that i've always thought was interesting was basically have you guys um ever had um what's it called an inspection so when you get in when you buy a house you get this inspection like have you ever been in your house and there's like this weird switch where you're like i have no idea what the switch does or dude i literally have 500 of those switches in my house yeah you're like i don't know what the switch does or you have um like when you have to change your air filters in your ac you're like all right i changed these two but then like six months down the line you're like oh whoa there's a filter right there i had no idea that was even there like so that stuff got to happen and when you i always thought it was odd when you get your home inspection i'm like why did they not give this to me in like a wikipedia style thing that i could just type in like what the hell does this do where is this thing and basically my home inspection i think i paid 350 for it i ended up getting a pdf and it was okay i mean it's a pdf that was like 80 pages it was so long and i'll me and my wife will like scroll through that sometimes and we're like wait what is this like like this window apparently needs to be changed every certain amount of time something has to change and i've always wished that i had like reminders and things like that and that's a little bit related to this because there are a lot of things that break and you're like i have no idea what the hell this does and so there's this company called inspectify that was i was curious about they're doing okay but basically they help you find home inspectors but i've always wanted a more of a digital component for my home inspection and then i was like because i thought about this idea a lot and i'm like i wish i had this alfred hello alfred component where i could very quickly hire ex-vendors to just come and fix this [ __ ] because i already know that every six months i need to replace blank blank blank i just have to dig through this 80 page pdf to figure out what it is it's literally like shazam for your home pick up stuff on yeah that would be step one immediately give you exactly what it is what you need to do with it when you need to maintain it whatever it's kind of cool what do you think ray so i have a crazy inspection story okay so a year ago i ended up buying this house in canada i told you about it yeah and it's in a small town i don't know anyone um and i somehow find this this inspector to inspect it i inspect it and he says the words were like it's perfect it's that's you know it's a it's an in french it means like it's a beautiful building like there's nothing wrong with it sends me the pdf all in french whatever i would have preferred in english but whatever i get it and it's like 10 on 10. fast forward you know house closes a week later um i see this note on the fridge and it says this guy named hector so i call and he's the handyman so i call this like handyman and i'm and i'm like hey can you help me with um you know with some stuff he was like oh by the way did they fit did they fix like all the rot in in the house and i was like what are you talking about man he's like i literally painted over everything and the house is rotting like it's gonna f literally the house is gonna fall apart any moment and i call back the inspector la belle battisca and he was like oh sorry like you're on your own and i had to literally gut the house build the frame in peak covid buy lumber at literally the peak and redo this 3 500 square foot house because my inspector couldn't inspect you know anything well there's no standardization within the inspection market so to sam's point on that inspection idea it's brilliant i think the inspection i didn't know that no there's no state dude it's some random person that comes out and has to like check different things but if they see something and they want to call it out as a big flag or they don't it doesn't matter i also think by the way that inspection companies are like in bed with the lenders and the banks because the banks the banks want to be in a good spot in terms of their loan to value and so they have an incentive when they're the ones actually paying for the inspection in the process to have it be under appraised and like when you come in and have an inspection and have an appraiser come in types of businesses out there where you only use one once every five or ten years and so like the service doesn't matter that much and i've always been fascinated by those because i don't think it's that hard to provide a little bit better service to be a little bit nicer so for example have you guys ever moved cross country i know you have yeah right i just did it just did it couple years ago and so the the cross country move business is incredibly interesting because if you go on and look at reviews it's like unanimously like bad like if like it's always bad and you don't know who's a scam and interestingly often if you hire one guy let's say you're moving from chicago to new york you call chicago you probably call a new york company that company's actually based in like um you know boston but they're gonna they're gonna actually send that lead to someone else in chicago or new york and so you don't actually know who has your [ __ ] they don't give a [ __ ] if it's actually good or not because they're like dude you're not gonna use this ever again just give us give us the money and so i've always been fascinated by businesses like that of which inspections is one of them and i like to think of things like what's something that you actually use one time but like i do think if you if you just improve the services a little bit it actually can be a significantly better and i love those types of mom and pop things those type of businesses too i mean the way those businesses operate is generally that they try to sync up with big companies that have executives and people doing cross-country moves and then they provide like quote unquote preferred rates to the big company for people to do reloads and they know it's a crazy business because basically what happened to us was like my wife was getting a relocation bonus for her work to move from san francisco to new york and they had preferred providers that we were supposed to use when we went and got quotes from those preferred providers it was literally like 25 grand to move cross-country we went and got an outside quote not a preferred provider and it was like 10. and so literally those people are just providing you these massive marked up rates because they know you're price insensitive because it's someone else's money that's paying for it how much stuff did you ship dude i had a whole gym man i had like probably like 2 000 pounds of weights golly like you know that yeah i try i i try owning not a lot of stuff because like the headache of owning stuff i i cannot stand it was a lot dude so i want to ask you about i know you're in the you're in the kind of home rental uh market i know you own a few homes and you've done this i keep seeing this new model that's come up recently and greg and i were talking about this earlier like this whole idea of like timeshare 2.0 there's this business i've seen it all over the place recently it's called picasso um they raised like three months after after launching they became a unicorn they raised well it was started by the uh zillow founder oh really exactly right second something i forget his name i think i think it started by the zillow founder and someone else who worked there so like i presumably they have some type of like domain expertise but then they got that like sweet sweet masasan money marked up massively like three months later i think seriously in a year and a half they're valued at like a billion and a half dollars insane raised a bunch of money like what do you think of this whole idea of timeshare 2.0 like are young people looking to flex on 1 8 home ownership of vacation homes flex no but can i tell you what i do so i spend about i live in new york for about four or five months a year and i rent out so i bought my the house that i'm in right now i bought it in texas and i furnished it and i like emotionally got like i didn't get attached to it because what i do is i rent it out so i rent out my home in texas to a long-term renter typically for eight to nine thousand dollars a month and i my fixed payment including taxes is like four thousand a month and so i profit five thousand dollars a month and i use that money to rent airbnbs uh in new york i'm currently trying to buy a place in new york that i can do the same thing so i could ideally live cheap although the economics of new york make it incredibly challenging and so i am looking at uh some of these like time share things uh the the i i don't know if it will if it can work out in a busy city like new york because i think there's like crazy amounts of restrictions but time-share businesses typically are great and i think that you're thinking about it a little bit in the wrong way i don't know if you are in the demographic i think that the demographic is people who um they just want like a really nice two-week vacation i mean most people like just they want to live their life and have a few kids and take uh two weeks vacation a year and and and have have a nice easy life and don't have the ability to go somewhere for four or five months at a time or something like that so i i in a way i do think timeshare it's not a horrible idea my in-laws had a place in our like [ __ ] aruba that they used to do this and they loved it it's so expensive though so like i agree with you i think that timeshare 1.0 like the idea that you could have a place in aspen that used for two weeks out of the year and it's reasonably priced i get that i totally understand the demographic for that i know there's a market for it because that model has existed forever but this picasso thing when i look at it and you go look at the homes on the site like pull it up i mean it's like you're paying three hundred thousand dollars for a one-eighth ownership or a 116th ownership of one of these places crazy expensive houses and so to me it looks like the type of model where you're like counting on people wanting to status signal like the whole idea that we're all status signaling monkeys which i actually agree with i think we're all sitting around trying to status signal different things but so you own any other argument i mean obviously you agree with that like that's like me saying it's daytime but my point is like i don't think you can actually flex on owning one eighth of a house and so i don't understand it like why do you go pay one-eighth for this place instead of just getting an airbnb in this place i think it feels good to like quote unquote own a second house but you can't decorate it like you're removing all the fun of a house well but there's also like this um um utility i mean like have you ever stayed like on airbnb's for a while it's a pain in the ass man finding places that have the good enough internet finding places that you you know are going to be or meet your standards it's a huge pain in the ass yeah but we just talked about that right we just we just talked about how like stress right like we we're trying to avoid stress like going on airbnb like finding going through reviews and it's like who can i trust who can i not trust yeah but with one of these houses you can't guarantee when you're gonna get to use it so like you're sharing it with eight other people or 16 other people you know the other people no you don't it's in a pool with an llc they create an llc it's kind of a brilliant model in and of itself they create an llc they put some debt capital into it so they can get a leverage return on the actual acquisition of the house you come in with eight other owners that they've vetted to make sure you're legit you go in and buy it and then you basically like fight with these other eight people for the best weekends and you're only guaranteed one holiday per year every other year or something so you're basically like fighting for when you can use this house but that like i just i just don't honestly i don't get it like i think the fun of home ownership is that you get to decorate it it gets to be yours you get to put your own touch on it this just feels like a glorified airbnb but then it's like an investment class and they're trying to spin it as like part of this new way i'll bet you money that this company is wildly successful you want to make a bet on it i mean they already are on paper like i i would paper no like if we can agree to some like realistic metric the guy who started it his name spencer he do you know who you know what he's done no what's his background okay so he worked at what's you what's the big pe company called tpg yeah tpg yeah okay worked at tpg then he started a company called hotwire yeah which he sold for which was basically hot wires for travel right yeah sold that for 700 million dollars to iac then led expedia which is like the largest travel company in the world then started zillow which what's i don't know 50 billion 20 billion whatever some huge real estate company now he's starting this so whenever i like invest or look at what's gonna be successful i look at like signals this is not a horse i would bet against i'm gonna bet on this guy i imagine he has some type of intel also dude sahil you live where are you where are you from are you from california i grew up in boston come on don't hit me with that california thing man i'm not a californian you had dunkin donuts this morning yeah i'm a duncan guy i'm a northeast i grew up in missouri yeah okay i don't think my art maybe our perspectives aren't entirely that different but if i just had to stereotype you as this like grew up in like palo alto but i for some reason my head i thought like you grew up in palo alto it's okay he's got big palo alto energy for sure yeah yeah yeah you do and you got that the the the that big palo alto andrew uh energy hardcore it like i i think that you have to get out of your bubble and go and hang out with like my family in st louis missouri or my family in kansas like not everyone like not everyone has a a beautiful 150 haircut like you have right now first off picasso is the epitome of that dude it's they're selling six million dollar homes it's not a they're not this isn't a time share i agree with you like if this was a time chair business and i actually think the more interesting model is gonna be the ones that come in below market on picasso and do this at a lower price point and say like we're going to create a much more effective interesting time share experience i actually would go along that type of thing i just don't think there are enough people who sit within the band where they can afford to shell out 200k in cash for a one-eighth ownership of a house and are fine not being able to actually flex on it with their friends we'll sue them because they own money i try not to do public math but uh what so one-eighth of a one-eighth is is what percentage of a year this well like we've got whiskey we've had whiskey there's always one like i honestly don't think there are enough people that are willing to do this are you would you do this would you own one eighth of a really sick house in cabo in cabo no i don't want it like what band of wealth is there person that does this that's fine but but but but but if i could do this so i am i my family my in-laws live in new york so i spend a lot of the year there if i could do this in new york so let's say one eighth is uh what's that six weeks a year something like that so to rent a place in new york i had it's it's terribly expensive i i spent 10 grand a month to rent a place in new york and it wasn't that nice of a place but it was okay so 10 grand a month is roughly 300 a night 320 a night that's how much like a hotel costs in new york unfortunately and so if i had to do that for five years i'm looking at 15 000 times five i mean that's a lot of money i'm gonna spend if you're thinking of it as like you're converting rent into equity and i like i think that's a fair way to think about it actually it's like okay i could i could pay this rent as like the airbnb and it's just dollars out the door or i could just make an equity investment into something but it kind of goes to the broader point of like all of these ridiculous assets that people are investing in now and i know sam and i are kindred spirits on this but like young people right now and especially in a 10 plus year bull market are investing in the wildest things everything has become an investment class and so it's just like i think this all falls into that same box i don't use this so i i i do not view your primary home that you don't cash flow on i do not view that as an investment i view that as the same as a car a lot of people get pissed off when i say this because they don't agree with me but i think like i don't understand how anyone could disagree but you're the the math suggests that in most cases homeownership that is non-cash flowing is not an investment that is a um a consumable i mean that is something that you use um if you make money off of it you're i think you're lucky but uh i believe the trailing hundred years homes have grown something like three and a half percent a year so they barely keep up with inflation so i think homes are a wonderful place to store value that keep up with inflation and they cause forced savings but it's not a wonderful way to generate cash flow if you want to generate cash if you want to generate income you should invest typically in public equities which is like seven and a half eight percent a year you should not invest in a home unless it is cash flowing now whenever i say that people are like oh so you don't think real estate is a good investment no i think it's a [ __ ] awesome investment if you are if if you are making money off of it via tenants paying you month uh money every single month yeah i think uh home ownership is actually just good as like a forced checkings account it's basically a checkings account right it's a for savings right it's like every month i have to like put aside for the majority of people every month i have to put aside you know 1500 2 000 3 000 into this mortgage so i know i need to like save that's that's why home ownership's great it's not like i'm looking at buying a place in miami right now i'm buying it because like i need a place to live right additionally there's that second big factor that people forget like why did i have a 30 or 40 steak last night because it made me happy and i wanted it yes so 30 house because i [ __ ] want it i want to live this place i want to decorate it and i want to feel nice about it and that's a wonderful that's a wonderful excuse why you should buy a house and for some reason people will rarely acknowledge that i'm like not everything has to make dollars and cents so if i want to buy this place in cabo why because i want to why do i want this fancy car i just want it so anyway i think that's a good enough reason utility if you're enjoying it and it makes you happy do it so i feel like we're on the same page so what we're saying here is what we're saying is here we want to make money you know well i think what we're saying is it's awesome to have a place that's our own yes and like have our artwork and have our vibe in it which is anti-picasso which is anti-picasso yeah actually sahil i'm saying i think you need to get out of your element a little bit and think beyond he keeps coming to me with this palo alto energy point i'm not from palo alto i just don't think you have to adjust everything with like is this a good asset class like nine out of 10 people you're gonna say asset class and they're like what the [ __ ] does that phrase mean what are you talking about yeah it's like i'm just doing this because i like it to remix this idea a little bit i would actually buy a house with you sam and you sahel like i don't want to be in an llc with a bunch of random quote-unquote vetted people i agree with that i would actually do this with a bunch of friends and see that would be a little cooler that's cooler because then the like if it was the three of us and like we have our group text thread if the group of us all said we were going to put some money into an llc go get a loan go buy a place and we would all collectively decorate it and it could be kind of our own we wouldn't care if other people were there when we went because we're all friends that's kind of cool yeah you create a pooled buying model rather than it's just randos that you're buying a place with i wouldn't be against like walking into the house and seeing like a big photo of you know an oil painting of sean poury and his wife just like over there you know doing ranches outside of austin and um i've wanted a ranch but i don't want to live on a ranch you know i don't wanna but i would like to spend four weeks there and so we've thought about uh collectively like teaming up with our friends um the problem is is that i have like a rule i generally generally try not to do business with buddies because i'd rather have the relationship over uh like the the outcome of what whatever that is um so i actually prefer strangers because it's easier to like tell them i don't like what they're doing um but i understand why people enjoy this and if they were that they were the right type of friends i would be interested in doing it my father has been asking me to buy a farm with them for a long time and i'm like i don't know man i don't know if i want to if i want to like if i want to get into that can i tell you guys let me tell you a quick real estate story really quick yeah not real estate but kind of related this is just a story for the people listening really quick so sahil and greg are in this room right now filming with these guys who i know adam and jordan they used to host this conference one time i went to the conference it was held this particular one they always hold at the four seasons one time i went to the four seasons at their conference and i go to check into my hotel this was in vail i go to check into my hotel and the guy at the front desk uh i said something like oh yeah my name is sam parr um i'm checking in um is the room nice and he goes uh yeah i think you're gonna like it and i was like uh okay he kind of had a smug look on his face so i was like i don't know what i'm getting into but i get up in the room and i walk in and there's like a kitchen and there's four bedrooms there's a fireplace there's a 16 person dining table a movie theater and i start walking around the room and i call them i go hey who else um like stays here like where um like i got who am i rooming with and they're like what do you mean i'm like well like who who stays in this room besides me and they're like sir that's your room and i was like wait i don't understand and they go yeah it's your whole place and so it's the presidential suite at the four seasons in vail it's 4 000 square feet this this hotel room i swear to god you can look it up bail and aspen or uh wait was the aspen whatever it was or something like that and i was like how much does this cost a night and they go it's like 10 10 grand a night during like in season and i stayed in this fancy hotel so uh it was like the i was like how the hell did i get here i guess they did i think they when they when they rented out the hotel they must have gotten like a huge block of room and for some reason i was dealt this like room i guess from there and i think this guy he must have i was only 27 or something he must have thought that i was like a mark zuckerberg or something like that and he like gave me this room and he had the smug face and so had palo alto energy not me bro i was so redneck i called them doubt and i go like who's my roommates it had a full kitchen and a movie theater it had a movie theater and had two fireplaces so you have to so if you're listening go google that room that was like the craziest thing i've done in a long time next time man well they are signing off from the room where it happens we need you back in the room sam so we had a pretty meaty episode let's hit some uh some takeaways here what do you got it's takeaway time you you first so i've got a few so number one home concierge business i know you think i've got some homework to do i think it's a really interesting idea i think if you nail the ops you find a good ops person to roll with something like this and you start regionally i think there's a really interesting business to build around it one of my biggest takeaways is that if anyone in the community wants to go start this thing seriously hit me up i do want to discuss it i'm very serious about it and then with picasso i just disagree with you guys on this i just don't think there's a big enough market of people that are willing to shell out this amount of money to own 1 8th or 1 16 of the house i just don't think it exists yeah i would say my takeaways first of all i like your idea i like the idea i just think that a lot of people have these startup ideas that are everything to everyone and you're gonna you kind of have to start with the archetype and then verticalize so for example start with that westchester new yorker 30-something and build a product for them so that's probably number one and on the picasa idea i'd say i actually actually really like the idea around like building something for friends and i think there's something there um like building products for group chats yeah like we all are part of group chats um and let's let's build something for them yeah i think that's it for today good vibes all around really enjoyed the discussion had a great chat with sam so until next time cheers man what are we cheers into good times to big palo alto energy i hate that so much i hate that so much dude i can't even tell you how much i hate that it might not make it everybody i hate banking most banking products suck so when i was starting all these new businesses and going on this new adventure i turned to mercury mercury is banking four founders by founders they make everything so easy and a beautiful elegant design there's

get it today so from time to time we are going to have to do just because of some pressing thing that has happened a special episode just jump on 15 20 25 minutes max and just go jam on something that has just recently happened that we feel like we need to talk about because it's very pressing and it matters you're all trying to figure it out we're trying to figure it out so we're just gonna jump on and jam today is one of those times and it's gonna be the first time we do it but we're going to be talking about twitter ceo change new ceo big news um perrog agarwal agarwal yeah getting announced yeah jack stepped down he was the founder and ceo right and then he he left i think right then he came back interim ceo and then ceo again yeah and then he was ceoing two publicly traded companies square and twitter which is like pretty odd i don't know if there's anyone else who does that and then all of a sudden we wake up and this former cto parag agarwal yep is now the ceo and i know you have spent a lot of time thinking about twitter um you were on cnbc you know last week um talking about it so curious what you think about it um yeah yeah i've been following this for a while so i think it's a really interesting situation you have basically like you need to to understand this move and to understand what it means for the business and for the stock i think you need to kind of go back in time a little bit so obviously you mentioned it jack was founder and ceo left came back was running this alongside square has a lot more control over square so that's one piece of contact square i think he has majority voting control a lot more equity value sitting in it twitter has become yeah it's been around for a really long time can we talk about that for a second yeah so like does jack even care about like is he does he care about the equity value because i don't think he i think he cares about the control i think the i think to him like if you go if you look at what jack cares about now it's like web theory and crypto and bitcoin specifically yeah and i just feel like he probably just didn't want to run a social networking website app anymore yeah and it's become increasingly a political headache right yeah so twitter has become more and more cumbersome it's not probably like the fun early stage startup tech company that it once was square still has that very entrepreneurial aspect they're doing a lot of cool things in bitcoin they're doing a lot of cool things in web 3 and crypto so i agree with you i mean i think it's become a headache so there's probably some piece of it that's motivated by that he really did want to step down but i think the really interesting thing to talk about here is like the impact of the activist investor that has been involved so elliott management came in i think it was like in 2020 basically put out a letter saying jack had to step down had to focus on square they should let someone just focus on twitter because it is weird running two big public companies as ceo they felt like it was being mismanaged as a result so they came in they said that the compromise that twitter reached with these guys um it was silver lake and elliott management was take two board seats we'll focus more on growth we'll focus more on revenue optimization and basically that was kind of like a a truce um at the time fast forward to today you're in a world where twitter really hasn't made a ton of progress on the revenue optimization especially around direct response advertising so for people that don't know in the social networking world facebook snap all these other players direct response advertising is like the highest profit ad platform you can have and that's all about generating a direct response so that's like you get an ad you click click on it to buy whatever the thing is it requires really good targeting and it's really good profit margins twitter has historically had a just abysmal ad stack and really very poor direct response advertising um split so for most platforms it's like i think 80 20 direct response versus brand advertising twitter is like the opposite it's 20 direct response and they've never been able to make a platform that is better for direct response advertising although to their um like i will say that twitter does monetize better than snap and discord on a per user per user basis yeah yeah so that we've got to give them some credit yeah well and they've improved they've improved to some extent i'm actually i mean you saw me i talked about it on tmc i'm actually bullish on what the long term is i know you're not quite as bullish on on twitter but my view around all of this is what happened was he kept getting pressure now suddenly he's like stepping down there's some rumors floating around you know ben thompson talked about it in his newsletter today there's some rumors floating around that basically like some of the board or somebody leaked it to cnbc who broke the news at like just before market open stock spiked at the market open like up ten percent or something like that then it got announced two hours later that paragraph while the cto who's been around for all of the challenges that twitter had was taking on the ceo role and the stock closed down two percent so there was this massive swing and then today again it's down several points and so clearly the market is not responding very well to what the future looks like because i think the hope was that the future for twitter was going to look very different than the past that they were going to focus a lot more on you know driving direct response driving more signal through the platform increasing the revenue uh potential driving more growth and i think the general response now is that maybe that's not going to happen and maybe there's an environment where you know we're not going to see that in the same way i think i gotta say i was surprised that um like perrag was was the choice i actually thought it was gonna be kavon who's the chief product officer who stand for classmate of mine oh i didn't realize that yeah yeah do you know him personally no i don't know him very well personally but yeah yeah i know i know him well and he he's he's awesome and he's a great product person um [Music] interesting that they chose someone technical to be the ceo that was just kind of an interesting it is interesting and i think it's part of the market response right the product side is their huge potential angle because twitter for me like if you imagine what the bold case for twitter looks like like how does twitter become a 200 stock or 150 stock it's by being the super app of the knowledge creator economy the information creator economy it is today the central point of discovery for anyone that's in that world of knowledge creators it's the place where you're generating the most discovery for new people coming in it's where you're engaging the most and then you're using it to funnel people into your paid things but now twitter is starting to roll out products where you can start to monetize with a review newsletter you can do the super follows the twitter blue like you can create more engaging content keep people on the platform longer form things and so the product angle what you just brought up of like kvon running more things is pretty interesting for them as a as a play because as you have better products as you have more engaging products what that does on the revenue side is it allows more signal to be drawn out of the platform which enables advertisers to actually target more effectively that drives up direct response and suddenly you're able to actually monetize the users more there's more engaging content which means there's more user growth and so that's a pretty exciting thing too twitter is just so frustrating for me because i'm like it's two to three product features away from being like a 200 billion dollar company right and when you open up the app yes they like okay they launch spaces they launch super follows they launch blue but it's like these are actually i'll give them credit on spaces like that actually was really well executed but the app basically feels the same yeah like it basically is the same app and when you think of like you know instagram facebook even um companies like that like they're tick tock like they're constantly innovating so i just i can't be i'm not really bullish you know if we're saying am i bearish or bullish like i love twitter yeah there's like it's so obvious what they could be doing they could be like professional social networking kind of vibe like more more towards like a linkedin uh experience they could i know they're doing some web 3 stuff but they could be like really really taking a bet there um but i just i mean i if i just look at the last 10 years and just see what they've shipped they're just the velocity isn't there but now the velocity sort of is there right it definitely for the first nine i don't know about that ten years you have twitter blue i do have twitter blue and like would you what do you think of that product um i like the ability to undo tweets it doesn't feel like a huge advancement i like the ad-free reading that comes with it um through articles but beyond that i mean it's not a huge advancement but i think a lot of people are using it i got to change the color of my app icon that was the other video i mean dropped i i honestly look at twitter blue and i'm like is are you serious like is this a joke like but it doesn't matter like it's to me it's less about what they've actually launched and more about the fact that they're actually launching things that's that's where my head is at i'm like at least they're showing can we raise the bar for twitter like can we can we raise the bar for twitter like our bar is so low for this for this company no other company we would have this bar this this low yeah um i totally agree with you this is like it's reminding me of this framework uh ben thompson just talked about it and it's an old market in jerusalem framework which is so good around this which is like the whole product market fit framework and andreessen had talked about way back in the day how there was like two eras of a company there's before product market fit and after product market fit and ben thompson i thought talked about it really well when he said basically twitter in some sense like hit product market fit too quickly and then had no incentive to continue grinding away at it to find new nuances and make changes quickly and so it hit this struggle point of like it literally was the perfect product from the get-go and especially for that era they hit it so quickly and people loved it so much the like micro blogging for breaking news quick things that they never had that grind of like having to keep innovating and adapting compared to a snap who like had some product market fit but hadn't really figured out the business and kept innovating very very quickly because they had this constant urge to continue to find new product market fit and new segments twitter never had that so suddenly it lost its entrepreneurial urge very early in its trajectory and now it's trying to restart it and it's pretty difficult to do as you're as you're saying yeah it's difficult to do and in a regard it requires organizational change like it requires like you know new people new energy and i don't know enough about what's going on inside twitter you know if they have the right people and i don't know if this cto is gonna be you know the person for it um if he's product oriented and he's got that energy then like i may be a little bit bullish to neutral but if he is not product oriented um no i don't think so i mean i'm kind of i'm kind of i'm kind of in the neutral to bearish on twitter right now stock is what 40. well let's let's close out with that on this so make your prediction of the future one year from today so today is november 30th one year from today the stock is currently trading at 43.55 as we sit here um basically over the life of the stock it's where it was when it went public like i think it went probably at like 40 and it's at 43. it kind of had the huge trough donald trump breathed some life back into it it spiked hit 60 plus in uh you know earlier part of 2021 now it's down at 43. one year from today and five years from today where do you have the stock and why one year not financial advice not financial advice one year from today it's trading at 43.59 right now yeah 43.58 all right i give it 58.43 one year from now okay so you know it gets a bump okay but i think it gets a bump because social gets a bump not because twitter is you know releasing tons of stuff um so lags behind the stock performance of snap and facebook i think facebook outperforms okay uh twitter okay and then five years from now i think it's exact it's exactly where we are today it's like 43 57 or whatever like twitter is one of those companies that i think just ends up um kind of coasting you know and unless unless this guy is is the savior um but yeah that's my gut on it okay you uh i'm gonna go on the other end of the spectrum here i've got twitter a hundred plus a year from now again not financial advice a hundred plus i think there's 100 upside from here um and five years from now i've got it at 200. so do you think it i think this one or underperformed facebook or meta i think it i think it outperforms all of the other social platforms okay that's my hot take um i i think there's so much untapped potential here and people want it to be amazing people haven't left in all the 10 years of this product being pretty bad and not innovating people are there and now all of a sudden they're starting to be glimmers of it being slightly more engaging and people are hyped on it not the stock yet but the business i actually think like i think there's a separation of business and stock here and i think the business is gonna start showing a bunch of potential and the stock might follow and so like that that's why i think it's gonna be i think it's gonna be a 200 billion dollar company what's the market cap right now let's look market cap today is 34 billion dollars i think this could be a 200 billion dollar company if only she's ridiculous if only we can create a twitter dow yeah and buy the company make a community owned and actually run this ship like it should be run the ship like it should be run then i think you're right we could create a dow to buy a board seat so that we would have how much is it i don't know i wonder i wonder if we formed a dow and made enough noise around it if we could convince them to give us a board seat as the dow as a community right like why interesting why is it think about this why is it that the community the twitter community doesn't have a seat on the board it's almost ridiculous it's kind of a fascinating idea why don't we actually we should go into the community after this and i want to talk about this packy mccormick hit me up my boy after you see this drop let's talk about doing this we uh we form a dow to take a i know he's a twitter bull too by the way because i've talked to him about this before but um we we form a dow to go take a twitter board seat and we position it to them we go talk to brett taylor the new chairman of the board who's a stanford grad by the way and um someone i think very highly of we get us get at least get a seat in the room and have a discussion with them of the community should own one of the board seats totally and we form a dow raise enough money to go do it and we take a board seat to drive twitter in the right direction i mean if constitution doubt could raise 40 million in a week could we raise 400 million in a month do you think i don't even know if we need 400 million we might be able to do it with a lot less and and convince them that it's worth doing and we can show enough support by raising some amount of money to go do it and go take the board seat and see if we can create some change around the product all right i think it's pretty interesting cool all right all right twitter dao we are going to buy a twitter board seat um that's the takeaway from today i really enjoyed doing this for a special episode and i hope you learned something from it if you're interested in getting involved in the twitter board seat dao hit us up in the community trwih.com to join and we look forward to seeing you

business i highly recommend you check it out today go to appsumo.com backslash the room it's red cameras are rolling mike is hot that's probably in the shot we got greg on twitter here so we should actually i'm going to wait [Laughter] twitter is a hell of a drug dopamine hits galore which actually leads to my question for you to start today yeah turning off talk to me about how you turn off like unwinding what do you do so you're like me like you're on twitter you're building and it's hard to stop thinking about this sort of stuff um and [Music] you gotta it's like healthy to turn off yeah so um over the years i've been collecting little life hacks to turn off and everyone is different so for me i'll just like list off the ones that come to mind yeah the office the show the show okay i was gonna say going to the office doesn't sound okay got it the show michael scott yeah i mean just like when i put on the office like i could it puts me in a meditative state okay so is that like a before bed unwind thing like pop it on netflix and watch yeah so i think the lesson there is like find your office yeah like it could be minus family guy it's true which is really bizarre because i don't think anyone really watches family guy anymore i love family i watch it almost every night before bed so it could be seinfeld friends it could be rick and morty like you name it yeah it's endless mindless yeah so that's one thing uh i recently tried like a cbd tincture okay what is tincture so it's like it's basically like a bottle where you have a dropper dropper yeah okay and people use it for sleeping okay and people usually use it to just kind of relax yeah someone described it to me as like an ibuprofen like it's just like a natural ibuprofen okay and it helps you sleep because one of the hardest parts of sleeping is turning off getting your mind to just like be at ease chill that's the hardest one of the hardest parts of life by the way like you say the hardest parts of sleeping i think i have a really tough time either focusing my mind in on one thing because we're like in this constant connected state where there's just constantly you know you're like notifications and things bugging you i mean you talked to me the other day about do not disturb mode on your phone it's changed my life already notifications turned off suddenly you don't have the like constant drum beat of things hitting you but i think it's cbd is an interesting one i've never tried it really yeah i mean i think you know you don't have to get it with thc which is the psychoactive ingredient in it it's just pure cbd and you know people use ashwagandha that's another one um there's mushroom tinctures there's a company called rainbow r-a-i-n-b-o i think not the crypto wallet not the crypto wallet that um you know also sort of helps with that sort of stuff so i think it's like find your tincture is maybe another good little life hack yeah which is um [Music] something that you take as a part of a ritual that helps you unwind yeah and and ideally that's not not something that you know is destructive right like don't go on like twitter might not be that thing for you right yeah um you need to find ways to escape general reality it's interesting because today we have a guest in who is building something that is basically in line with this overall thesis they're like people are um overly connected they're not finding ways to unwind they're not finding healthy ways to kind of escape and to get away and to improve their health and well-being and their mental health and stress levels etc and so it'll be fun to talk to amanda about how she's thinking about that and also honestly like destigmatization right all this stuff cbd thc i mean all of it mushrooms like all of these things are really stigmatized still in our culture and so it'll be interesting to talk to her about how you build out in front of that destigmatization i'm interested in the startup side of de-segmentation right so it's like how do you like what's you know it's really the wild west yeah and like how do you build a business around it yeah and how do you navigate like the legal aspect of it yeah um what does it look like shipping cbd products yeah across state lines across state lines countries like how does that like yeah be an interesting question for yeah let's dive right into it it's good segue what are we drinking we are drinking my favorite tequila i actually just i tweeted this uh yesterday i was like i only drink como's you can just twist it i think and it'll pop right off boom friend joe thank you for the komos he sent us over some some coma so i'm going to give you we talked about unwinding and we're talking about de-stressing and this is tequila a nice stiff pour of tequila drink in moderation and drinking water always drink in moderation cheers cheers cheers to you man cheers all right oh that's good okay so i actually thought that was a good segue um to some of the stuff i wanted to talk about today i've got a couple ideas around this i know you do too um so where are we gonna start destigmatization as like a thesis or a backdrop to build businesses um it relates to a lot of different things we've talked about in the past of you need to have a view of what the future looks like have it be different and then right and this is an area where you can do that right like we talk about cbd you're talking about cannabis and the way that that industry has developed over a long time talk about psychedelics all of these are industries where historically they've been viewed very differently than what they are likely to be viewed at viewed as in the future and so how do you build a business around that so the question is how do you build a business around and destigmatize yeah destigmatization uh as a mega trend and then where are the opportunities from a business standpoint around that so the hardest part about building a business in a stigmatized arena is people are not educated so you have to get them to unlearn certain things so for example with cannabis you know for for decades there was you know essentially propaganda yeah that was actually highly racist around uh you know saying that you know if you use cannabis you will go crazy basically yep um i think it started in like the 20s and 30s um and you know here we are today in 2021 where um there are people in jail for selling small amounts of marijuana it's absolutely black i mean it makes absolutely no sense to me it's crazy yeah and i think you know at the core of it it comes down to racism and and and control but there's been so many studies around you know cannabis helping all sorts of people anxiety cancer dealing with stuff ptsd so there's plenty of med you know medicinal use cases of of cannabis and um and also recreational yeah you know in moderation yeah um so my point is when you're when you're creating a business in one of these arenas like let's say you want to create a startup in in cbd your first step is educating people about hey like here's all these use cases and here's like here's why you should be using this yeah and that's tough right that's tough to do yeah like whenever you're educating a market you have to spend money to educate on market ultimately like sp spend resources time content yeah uh but maybe there's a business you can so i think you're hitting on something really interesting it's making it's giving me a business idea so yep bear with me on this um so psychedelics i have a similar set of profiles to where i think marijuana thc cannabis was 10 years ago in that it was criminalized in the 60s and 70s i think as part of this like massive moral panic that happened in the u.s like some people you know did some bad things when they were under the influence of psychedelics in extreme cases that happens with a lot of it happened to people on no drugs and so it became this like moral stigma the government took it into their hands criminalized all these things and the reality is science is starting to show in a meaningful way that psychedelic compounds can be extraordinarily useful for people dealing with depression i mean we're gonna it's gonna completely separate and completely change antidepressants anti-anxiety medicines and part of it is like lobbyists and all the money they're spending for pharmaceuticals and big pharma and all of that's going to get blown out but right now you're at a point in time where people don't understand it and so to your point on education what business can you build around that my mind goes to this idea of like a concierge i've talked about concierge ideas in the past i love this thing but think of like psychedelics as a service like psychedelics as a concierge and how you could build a business around that so say i'm new to this space and i want to learn more about how these compounds might be able to help me might be able to help me experience new things about myself mentally physically spiritually whatever it is i have no idea where to start right now i mean i could go and read for hours and hours there's no one that i can go to that's like my point person my river guide if you will to kind of guide me through this landscape so my idea would be you start a business that is kind of part education but part um you just have a point person a concierge to guide you through the entire range of experiences that you might be able to have and then actually make the connection points and the introduction so that you can execute those experiences as you see fit or as you want to i actually first of all i love concierge businesses in general i actually i started in 2012 i started a company called five by which was our tagline was your online video concierge okay and you went there and it served you up the best internet videos based on who you are what you know what that sort of thing so i think like whenever whenever you want to give you know something on a silver platter a concierge business makes sense and like there's a ton of verticals that you can apply to now when it comes to let's say psychedelics i think it's a perf it's perfect so i think my question comes to like comes down to like what is the business model is it like a monthly fee that you pay and how does it work and also like how do you make sure that the concierge is giving recommendations that you know isn't like his buddy you know so here's how i would do it it needs to be trust is really important in concierge type businesses yeah so here's how i would do it i'd go first off i'd go premium so the price point would be high call it 100 plus a month that you're paying to this concierge um i would go regional so basically i would go pick an area that had a high density of high stress working professionals probably okay tell me why you'd go premium why i would go premium versus just like so i think it goes to trust like when you're paying a premium price point and you're getting like something that feels really premium the trust is kind of baked into the appearance and the feel of it like when you go to a website it's a really nice premium website you immediately have this feeling of trust you don't worry about putting your credit card information in there there's just like a degree of trust that comes with something looking really appealing and i think premium pricing and a premium feel to the entire experience creates a level of trust and so when you're dealing with something that's stigmatized you're dealing with like a sin industry quote-unquote i think it's really important yeah okay i buy that i like starting i like starting high-end and then making your way sort of you know mid-tier and low-end yeah so you're going to start there 100 bucks a month and then how like how does the product work like do i have is it via text is it yeah do i get to speak to someone so the way i would do it is i would like i said regional say say you started in new york city ton of working professionals a lot of people that are highly stressed out um they subscribe to this service and it is your point person it's like your river guide that can give you the entire range of experiences both through the website or through like individualized you know texting calling platform whatever where they'll give you all of the different kind of options what is out there i honestly don't know i would benefit from something like this is it ayahuasca is it mushrooms is it lsd is it acid like all of the different things that exist in this ecosystem and all those words sound scary to a lot of people and so having one person that you can ask questions about it you can you know discuss the risks you can ask about what the range of experiences is and then there's like an open platform for who they recommend like the best experience with ayahuasca maybe it's someone in joshua tree and they know and they're like a preferred provider through this but basically this becomes your conduit to get information ask questions be connected to safe and high quality providers of these things and this company the concierge actually kind of sits as like a middleman where you're not dealing with all of the issues of actually distributing or sharing these products but you can kind of exist as like switzerland if you will sitting in the middle layer of it i like the idea of so to add to your idea maybe it's like a monthly call that you get with your river guide okay by the way i've never heard the term river guide but i actually agree it's a great term so like maybe you call this thing river guide yeah so you go to riverguy.com and you set up like your monthly call and it's it's not only about the transaction of like buying whatever you need to buy but it's about like hey it's almost like a you know a therapy session right so you're like having this like therapy session 30 minutes 45 minutes an hour maybe it's a hundred dollars to 500 a month maybe more a thousand dollars you can charge and then if it makes sense that's when it's like oh hey like i think this is a really important time for you to have like a spiritual quest yeah and it might not be every month it might be once a year yeah but you have that and you're building that ritual yeah and it's a highly word of mouth driven river yeah we should call them yeah it should be river guide yeah because it's a god i love river god yeah it's a god and it has the resonance too for people with like a psychedelic experience you have a god but i like the idea because it has um you're taking like the therapy aspect which i like that you just added that because then you're kind of figuring out and you're creating a pattern of like what does this person need what what is the experience like are they highly stressed out do they need to have and you know are they anxious do they have issues with depression like and you can curate the overall experience that they're getting with the different psychedelic components with that that's how you and the website when you get to the website it should feel like you're signing up with like pandora right or something like that yeah where it it learns about you so like for example with five by uh our mobile app that we started in 2012 the the first thing it said was like in our onboarding it was like are you are you the type of person that likes to go to coachella or like ski in the alps or like go hang out in you know on the beach and we would like ask a series of these questions and from that we would infer a lot of data to get them to a place where they were getting um great you know a great content experience yeah so i like that like you when you come into it you're like onboarding that you could create is asking these different questions that then kind of put you into a path that your person can flesh out and provide insights around i the thing i like too is just these businesses where when you're playing in destigmatization and we should talk to amanda about it when we have her in the product path is really tough and so i'm interested to get her perspectives because dealing with the product pack you have to deal with shipping you have to deal with things across state lines federal regulation versus state regulation with this like i said you're kind of switzerland you can exist in this middle layer where people haven't really wanted to touch it because it is stigmatized as an industry but you don't have to deal with all those shitty challenges that you have to deal with when you're on the product side so you can kind of take the pure profit of this monthly recurring revenue and not have to deal with it it's sort of like i got pitched recently on like a sin stripe business you know like stripe doesn't want to touch porn and they don't want to touch uh you know all of these other industries drugs all of these things and so there's a industry that's forming to basically build stripe but it's a you know payment rails that don't care about what you're doing and just let it happen it's sort of like what silk road did way back in the day and obviously ross is in jail but like that whole idea of build something around um an area where people don't want to touch it because of the stigma yeah i mean i i i think pay safe is uh the paypal of sin yeah they're uh you know three to four billion dollars in quotes because i i don't think many of these things are really well i think i think like how um how society views it yes and there's tons of biblical sin biblical saying i think there's there's tons of there's tons of opportunities to build there yeah uh if you want to build there i just think that going back to saying earlier i think it's the the challenges with those types of businesses are often education yeah um but there's tons of opportunity there yeah and there's actually vc firms that are popping up to support those industries like ten years ago five years ago like good luck rape i couldn't hear what you said five years ago ten years ago say it again because my apple watch is being very rude five years ago 10 years ago good luck finding a vc to back your cbd business yeah um now there's a lot more support for that sort of stuff yeah and there's even vc firms dedicated yeah um to these industries yeah well that's interesting i mean it's like consensus you know forming over time right like feces get a hard time for just like following the crowd and doing the same thing as everyone else but it's cool when you have these vcs that are starting to think differently about these industries and deploying capital into them because ultimately i mean i'm a i'm a capitalist and i'm a free market guy i think that when you start having capital flow into these ideas capital plus people talent like people that are watching this and starting to think about psychedelics or destigmatization you're going and building in that space that's how change happens because there will be a lot of smart people building in it building new things new ideas you start having regulation you know kind of as a lag and following that i do think in 10 years it's hard to imagine the level of criminalization around psychedelics as exists today and so if you were out in front of it and building you should reap outsized rewards for doing that yeah so i would say like for those listening watching i think like start with the science like believe in what you're doing yes um and it has to be authentic be authentic uh figure out what is the the easiest way to educate people in a consumable way that's fun and interesting um pick a vertical like don't just go for everyone like if you know go to new york or premium or pick people who are stressed like come up with that identity um the atomic unit of this by the way is exactly what you said which is education and the component of like you could build something that all it is is that opening portal you mentioned that you guys did with five by where you just log in you click you know different things you're experiencing it's like gamify it's a fun little game and it spits out here are the kind of different like um the different compounds that might be a fit for your life and for what you need and here's how they might benefit you that literally could be a business in and of itself you could probably do advertising around it bring in advertisers that would want to sponsor the page and make money off of it and that's how probably you should start yeah which is like a very simple way to do customers no code no venture capital like it's actually probably what you validate build the audience like learn and then from there it's like okay you know where do we go from here and i think like one of the best ways to build a business is when you you know you've built an audience right yeah you've built a big audience around a particular vertical so like you built a big audience around people who want to sleep better using cbd yeah and [Music] and that's what i want to talk to amanda about actually like she built an audience on twitter yep um and learned a lot on twitter didn't you know and then from there kind of like built a business around it yeah so i think like yeah curious your perspective there yeah yeah i mean you know i agree with the idea of building audience and going and using that and the distribution around it i think we should talk to her we should bring her in i want to talk to her about this idea because i'm curious for her thoughts i know she's going to have a lot of interesting perspectives on it and i have like it's forming in my mind now from hammering it around with you the exact way that i would go and do this and i think you can just like hammer away with audience and with targeting distribution like buying ads in a specific locale to bring people into that like opening funnel and just use that to launch a business very quickly in the space but i want to talk about it whether yeah and i also i also have a question about like ads right like sure can you buy facebook ads for this sort i don't know it's a good question actually let's let's bring her in let's bring her in and we'll talk about this this is a good one how did you do homeschool three kids eight six and four years old i guess they were seven five and three and you started your business last year yeah are we even recording right now oh yeah yeah i'm like i actually want to i actually want to know this but we can throw it in later but like how did you actually manage that that's insane um so i moved i left new york city moved to charlotte north carolina just because i wanted space and like outdoors and i found two 24 year old girls who basically lived with me for a year amazing and it was a small village because like they were in the house all the time i have i would have four moms from the neighborhood in my garage packing up house of wise shipping it out like we had a little compound but like child care if you think back to like what it was hundreds of years ago it was like tribal and now we're like left to do it on our own or like hopefully with a partner but yeah i felt like i brought that tribal mentality back and it was incredible my kids were flourishing yeah because they had all these people who loved them and were helping them but we all have different views and experiences so cool it was cool it's like it takes a village thing yeah yeah it is it's interesting just like historically that was the way that kids were raised and they were part of it was part of the overall community and there was really a community feel i don't feel like society has that community feel anymore i'm trying to convince like two of my friends in brooklyn to move into a house with me they have two kids and i'm like let's just all right create a mini commune like wouldn't that be awesome and then if like if i want to go out and they can watch the kids if they want to go on a date you know what it's like it's like the kibbutz you know those uh in israel uh jewish people they did the kibbutz in israel which is well no it is it's like an israeli it's an israeli jewish thing it's like a community in there yeah it's a social it's a it's a socialist thing too right like they share in their like basically uh you're like farming right you're farming and you create stuff yeah and then you share it and you're all together we're in it together a little socialist society i grew up on a farm in illinois okay it's like 800 people my parents didn't go to college and they built the house i grew up in and they're still in like my parents have never been on an airplane like to this day they still live there yeah and they built the house three miles from my grandparents farm and my mom is one of 11. so growing up it was just you'd go and spend all weekend at your grandparents house with all of your cousins and no one was watching you yeah it was not safe unstructured but yeah i spent a lot of time like unstructured you have siblings one older brother what is he doing he's in central illinois i'm kind of the like you were the one that kind of escaped yeah okay what i was up to yeah what what like just what sparked that were you like from a young age super independent wanting to escape and go run away and go do something literally my parents had to put like alarms on the house when i was two because i would literally just leave the house someone just told me a business idea about this with having kids where um so i'm about to have my first kid and thank you and uh apparently you need to like baby proof your house where like not right away dressers and things you need to have them like attached to the walls so the kid can't pull them over and someone pitched me on this business idea of uh like a service that comes in and baby proofs a house because i don't want to do it like i have to hire a handyman i don't know like yeah electrical side there's probably a bunch of things i don't know that i actually need to be baby proofed and so could you like build a service that just comes in and does all that stuff for you you pay them like 500 bucks concierge yeah they come in and do the whole thing uh maybe that's a good segue to actually bring it to our actual conversation so amanda amazing to have you we're so so excited um you're someone that i've looked up to and admired from afar for a long time now um for a number of reasons which we can get into um but a big piece of it is you are building something that a lot of people would be scared to build um and you are someone that is building a product company as part of this wave of de-stigmatization around an industry what we were just talking about before you came in was this whole idea we have around building a company to educate and like river guide people through psychedelic experiences and so this whole idea that like you can create a concierge and charge a premium price point to have a business that explains to people educates them on this entire new world that most people are scared of and don't understand you have any thoughts on just like that as a business i mean there are companies in the ketamine space that are doing this where you can do like a ketamine experience at home um i mean i think we have to break the conversation down into like medicalization versus like recreational use okay because i think that they're two separate conversations of like which one you're you're thinking about because the thing that gets me i guess most heated or most like animated about this topic is just that there's so much that these that psychoactives cannabis etc can be used for like depression anxiety ptsd and everybody's lumping it all together and we're like at this like blocker whereas if we decouple the conversation and say okay there's decriminalization like if you're using it for personal use like you don't go to jail like we still have 40 000 people sitting in jail for cannabis charges when it's like not yet federally legal it's insane right and it's mostly young african americans and hispanic people by the way so that like the racism overlay to this is very real sure so i mean the the criminalization of cannabis is so rooted in um like it's named marijuana because it was a mec tied to mexican race so it there's so much i didn't know that it's interesting there's so much rooted in racism there um and like the war on drugs is like truly a war on people yeah right but um but yeah i think that there needs to be if we don't decouple these things people are dying from mental health like every single day we saw today's veterans day like reading about veterans and how they can't get used to like medical use with cannabis so i'm i there has to be more focused on this because it will yeah help people so let me pitch you on this idea okay so i'm a working professional in new york i imagine imagine me like i mean you kind of are yeah i'm not a banker i don't have banker energy but imagine i'm a banker in new york city and i'm stressed out all the time i work a ton maybe i have some depression issues some anxiety probably just because i'm getting 8 000 emails a day and i want to learn more about this because i've heard or listened to podcasts that talked about it hubermann like some of these amazing podcasts michael pollin's book change your mind how to change your mind and i want to learn more about it but it's intimidating these new industries new spaces you're like oh all i've heard about it was from my parents it's different generation to your point the narrative hasn't shifted yet there's a lot of noise right like noise so you create a business where i go into this like beautiful looking website and i put in like yes i this is the industry i work in finance and i have some issues with anxiety and maybe i take a couple of these medications whatever it is and it spits me out like here are the psychoactive compounds and different experiences whether it's ketamine whether it's mushrooms whether it's lsd acid whatever it is and here's the kind of range of things that might benefit you given your profile and now by the way here is this like amazing beautiful concierge experience you can have where someone will talk to you once a month and guide you through all these different things and refer you to the right people where you can have a safe experience with these so you kind of exist as like a switzerland like you're not selling the product but you're kind of sitting in the middle and you're educating plus connecting people to have these experiences and like creating the on-ramps to this new world love everything two things you're not solving for that are really big issues is acquiring and quality control okay both of those are unsafe right now like i've had bad experiences where you don't know where it's coming from and you have a really bad trip right so you're telling people what to use but then that's a huge leap to like where do you go how do you get in yeah who do you call if you have a bad trip like all those things i i feel like it'd be very dangerous to start that company without the like pathway to acquisition yeah so that's a great call out so i do think i think that's a great point and it's a dangerous point if it goes wrong so i think you would have to have like preferred providers people that you know like sort of like on yelp or on any of these sites where you have the like people five star reviews yeah exactly like you know exactly but because you wouldn't be the one actually with the product you kind of de-risk yourself a little bit from a business starting standpoint but i think you have to have that i i totally agree with you i think you should also have like a help line like if you're having a bad day yeah that's a great point you're having a bad trip like you need someone that you can call that could talk you out of it i think that's like i mean i'm curious your perspective on that like how important is talking someone off a cliff when they're having an experience um and have you seen any services out there that help people i mean the academy one year like mind bloom is the one that comes to mind like they're they're being funded um like our in-house sex expert just did a at home ketamine treatment she like did a whole tick-tock series on it um that's a big company now mind-blowing it's like getting a ton of traction i don't know if you've seen that it's a very cool company yeah i have i haven't done neither right like i haven't experienced it but interested to see what it like would do and unlock but um it's more of an anti-social experience from what i've heard in in the like sufficient doses and so it's a little different from how a lot of people think about these things where you're going out and experiencing things it's more like internal but to answer your question dosing like you're talking about like you've already taken too much right and so like or bad or bad product or a bad product so again it's like everything that has to happen before the person ever takes something which is what is the proper dosing because like i'm in the cannabis industry and i still like quality control is a thing i like if you take an edible from one dispensary versus another and that's the other issue like most of what the fda is doing tests on is from like mississippi and it's like really diluted they dry it out so the terpenes aren't in it like it's not like they're not even doing research on like the stuff that is actually in dispensaries so it's not one to one and so dosing is a huge issue quality control is a huge issue so i think you have to vertically integrate this whole thing for it to be i think a really great company yeah this is an interesting point because my whole thesis was you could create the switzerland like you could create this middle layer where i called it a river guide and like business name like you need someone to guide you down the river and like guide in a real sense as like for these trips but also when you hit rapids or when you have a bad situation you need someone to be able to guide you through it and my whole thesis was that you could be you could be horizontal in it what you're saying is that it's actually really hard to do that because and you've experienced this so i actually trust your opinion much more than my own but verticalization within this is important because then you can control the entire experience for people yeah so that's interesting i um i'm curious for your perspective like you're doing the product side of this you're building something that honestly is still stigmatized people don't like to talk about sex like even now which is it's crazy but on the when i go to your page house of wise what i see on the front page is sex gummies so like talk a little bit about building product that still triggers people a little bit there's something that people feel when they when they see those words for me i go into the i get really curious on like why are people triggered by talking about something that everybody does and that comes from a very patriarchal society right that women aren't supposed to talk about so right and also like if you think about sex as utilitarian when you become a mom like why are you posting sexy photos because you've already had your kids like and as a mom like i just think that changing the narrative for me the thing i get out of bed every day and say we have to change the narrative on owning your sexuality not for in a hetero normative sense a man's pleasure and that's why there's so many things that affect libido especially in women like we have hormonal cycles we are have a higher stress level which blocks cortisol and or high cortisol blocks like testosterone release etc right so there's so many things that affect your libido but yet there have sexual health has not been a vc category until about like two years ago seriously but yet erectile dysfunction medicine huge industry but we're not supposed to get help because we're women and it's because the vcs are generally white males didn't want to talk about it right i go in there talking about sex gummies and they're like yeah we're done here or they just like feel you get pushed back in your chair and you see a bunch of guys like oh i don't want to talk about this but it's our number one product because women need help in that department and that shouldn't be stigmatized right like like we're all having sex partner or not like let's have an actual conversation so we can figure out because if we're not even having the conversation we can't figure out what the problems are so then we can't solve or create products to solve those problems and so i'm just fortunate that i have a ton of women yeah in my community in like our slack channel that we have like real time like user research on what the actual issues are so we can talk to it like create content that actually speaks to us in a way that's like not this like polarizing thing where we're super super taboo and talk like trying to make you blush it's like no sex is healthy it releases oxytocin it helps with serotonin like these are good things for you so let's talk about as sexual health yeah it's um you hit on a few things there that i think are amazing so one the community aspect which we've talked about this before but amanda what you did with building an audience around all of this and building the community around all of it is amazing because you're a perfect example of someone who built this audience around the product you were going to be releasing into the market like you had built this big audience and you were building this audience prior to launching any of your products and so suddenly you were already talking about these things you were yeah you were part of the destigmatization of all of these things and then you were releasing a product into it and so it's this amazing case study of this new world we live in where you can do that you can build audience before product and then go and launch into that where you already had people that wanted that from you is that what happened you you built an audience and then you're like i want to see this product like can you walk through a bit of like the timeline of i wish i could say i was like this genius the grand strategy of that so when i got my divorce i was like at the height of my career early marketing for big company and had three kids under the age of four so that's when i started using cannabis i had never touched cannabis in my life i was an athlete my whole life so never touched it realized it was helping me realize all my friends were drinking so much alcohol and they didn't understand what alcohol was doing to them but no like it affects your rem cycles like it does lead that affects your libido like it's this kind of snowball effect right and so covet hit i saw my friends literally drinking more than i've ever seen and they are you know struggling with depression and anxiety so i was like [ __ ] i need to go create this i it was in my head already that i wanted to create a brand that destigmatized cannabis for people like me executives moms etc were you still at your job at that time when you had the idea yeah yeah um came up with the name on a work trip to india it was a very like you pray love moment um but india has that effect on people i've spent time there and it's oh it's like this when you see that many different type of people and the culture and the struggle that a lot of people have just like how much that grounds you as a human being yeah sorry i interrupted you but i agree it creates clarity in so many ways and grounding but um yes i saw my job i raised a pre-seed round while i had my full-time job i told the investors i couldn't leave because i was in the middle of a pandemic with three kids on my like taking care of them so raise the precede and where were you with like twitter followers at this point like were you at 25 000. no i just got on twitter now two years ago yeah you were at the same time as me i remember this yeah i remember this yeah and so i i'm an open book like if we if we're at dinner like i'm gonna talk to you not only about business but like my dating life or whatever right and so i just started tweeting like i talk and then i would do like tweet threads about marketing or you know this is my second startup so i tweet about startups or whatever and all of a sudden it was just like things started to take off and the things that were taking off were like just me talking about authentic yeah realness like the struggles of being a parent during the pandemic dating life whatever so we launched december 1st my fault like my followers were probably around like 30k something like that and then i got to meet jack dorsey like that was that was like a cool twitter moment because they literally reached out and they were like we don't know how you're doing what you're doing that's cool how do we like what how can we make twitter better for women so that more women voices there's more space for women um that is a huge issue they have actually yeah yeah it's male dominated very much though yeah it's a bit it's a boys club for sure yeah it comes with network effects though because like like you saw with clubhouse even like in the beginning it's like you guys all know each other that was where we first met was in a clubhouse room we were both on this panel in a clubhouse room i remember that that's right yeah yeah so then launched december 1st started talking about what i was building but to grow my wise women is what we call them house of wise we have wise women so we have 700 women who are micro affiliates they talk about the products of their friends they like use these things to like sell it on their phones et cetera right i tweeted out like does anybody want to talk about how to have better sleep sex etc i'm building something for women my dms were not and so i hired like a person like a taskrabbit to literally go through put all those names in a spreadsheet and then i invited all those women at the time it was like between 400 and 500 women into a slack channel and so i treated them like they were part of the company they were investors i gave them updates on the products i would send out a few like early samples to have them they talk like show them packaging et cetera and then by the time we launched on december 1st we had over 500 women that had digital assets that were just talking about it so it felt like it was everywhere yeah so houston wise is a community-based product like right it's like community through and through it started with a community and the community is is really what's driving a lot of the success yeah 100 so cool this is like it's uh it's giving me a new framework which greg makes fun of me i'm like the frameworks guy on the show but um this is like the uh it's like the nsfw framework of like building businesses around things that people are afraid to talk about at work like things you're not supposed to talk about you're not supposed to talk about sex you're not supposed to talk about drugs you're not so let's talk about all these things yeah they're all being destigmatized it's all becoming more normal and we're starting to live in a world where you can talk about all these things but because it's been so taboo or stigmatized things haven't been built the infrastructure the product companies the infrastructure layer has not been created yet and so can you go just like use that as a business ideation to go build around that i think it's cool that's a good framework i like it i mean it's cool that's a really good one i think like to me this is a classic example of authentic like you're not your own you're not the only person that's feeling this way right so you like identified this feeling that people have you brought people together you created an intimate space and you co-created a product yeah you didn't create a product you co-created a product yeah i think everyone that was has been there from day one they feel like their fingerprint is on it somewhere which is really cool that's why like the word even founder like i'm just thinking out loud here but like it's almost like an outdated term like because like i feel like the products of the future you know it isn't one person isn't you know these like multiple founders it's like it's your micro affiliates right it's it's your co-creators yeah you're a co-creator captain of the basketball team totally you also have exceptional founder market fit like you use a i hate using bc terms generally but like founder market like you were the right person yes you got a drink every time you use a bc term i think it counteracts the a16z comment actually now i'm good i'm like at baseline um but i think like you were the right person to start this too because it was so authentic and it was something you really deeply cared about and something you had benefited from and experienced in real time and so to go build a community it's really hard to build community if you're not authentic and credible around what you're trying to build around and so you were the right person to build this community because you were experiencing these things you were a mom you were trying to manage your kids and teach them in a covid world which was nuts and like you're trying to manage that with the stress of being a full-time you know working person and then starting a business and it's just like it all builds up to there's this amazing credible authenticity that you were kind of going with um i just think it's i think it's amazing yeah well the thing that i saw is that there's a lot of vc-backed businesses around talking to women about their careers then there's vc-backed businesses that are like let's talk to you about motherhood there aren't that many spaces about your sexuality yeah right but like time is our most finite resource and if i have to go to three different groups of people to talk about my one self that is so [ __ ] exhausting so true so i'm like we are multi-hyphenates like that's like the term that we like to say like i am a mom but that is not my identity like that is a job and function that i have i'm also a sexual human like that is a part of my life i like i'm a marketer whatever whatever your roles are i don't want to talk to 8 000 groups so i wanted to create this community that was a space that acknowledged that first and foremost as a principal like you are a full human yeah i love it i think it's amazing it's a good place to end too i think because that like that final point of embracing everything that you are and the like full circle of who you are as a human is a really really cool takeaway for me so thank you so much for the time you're the best this is awesome this was seriously awesome and where can people find you i do want to give a i want to give a product plug here because first off i'm super excited to take this pre-workout pre-workout yeah people think cbd is just a downer but like when it's paired with really good active audience it works i'm really excited for it house of water is not just for women right you could be a wise man there you go forward to it thank you so much and tell us the website houseofwise.com amazing thank you so much for coming in you're the best yeah you're the best saaho what was your biggest takeaway from our conversation with amanda so i think for me first off i think this business idea is really interesting the whole idea of like creating river guide for these new experiences where you need to educate you can create a concierge experience i think there's actually a business to be built here so as a community takeaway i would love to get in there and jam on this further and riff with people that might be interested in building it yeah and my biggest takeaway is that i feel like for years people have been saying that you know cannabis is the they call it the green rush right um and there's all these like stigmatized spaces and there's all these people coming in and you're not too late i guess my biggest takeaway is you're not too late there's still tons of opportunity tons of narratives to own tons of community-driven products that you could create um so the future is bright yeah i think the community-driven piece is key i mean amanda's a great example of that what she built building that community stoking that and just creating a safe space for people to talk about these things that they were never supposed to talk about and then launching a product alongside it it's brilliant so i learned a ton from it i thought it was amazing and i'm really excited to further the conversation get in the community with you guys and continue to jam on all of this so if you've got any ideas around stigmatized businesses throw it in the discord and let's let's chat appsumo is the

telling my parents about what we're doing the idea of this podcast the show the community and you know the whole thing your parents they don't really get it they're like not in the tech world my parents grew up in the 50s 60s 70s and so i'm talking to my dad this weekend and i was like dad you know it's uh it was his birthday we're hanging out we're having a couple drinks it's like dad i'm super excited we're filming the first episodes this week it's gonna be a blast it's gonna be so fun we've got some guests coming in it's gonna be a hell of a time and he kind of looked i mean he was

lindsen with us today we've got a bunch of really cool people and he just looked at me kind of with this blank stare on his face and he was like well how about uh how about like elon musk or like jeff bezos because they would be good and i sort of just looked at him and he was dead serious dead serious saying this to me and uh i just sort of said you know dad i appreciate that you have this faith in me i think they're a little hard to get like maybe we'll loop them in when we get obama and jesus but uh man that was something else so my dad's got a lot of faith in me i mean i like that he he he like he's a dream big type of guy he is a dream big kind of guy and i appreciate it um so let's dive into it dude all right let's we're gonna get uh we're gonna get some drinks going for every episode we're going to have something we are so lucky to have what is in my opinion the best tequila in the world komos from our friends over hack homos yeah joe marchese shout out thank you so much bottle's really cool it is the best tequila i've ever had in my life and unfortunately or fortunately i've had a little bit too much tequila well this is my first time trying it so well you're going to enjoy it cheers all right cheers welcome in with us we're so excited and let's dive right into it man so good damn that's good so good all right so what are we talking about today so i don't know if i told you this but i went to the bank because i want to buy a condo in miami okay and as one does by the way as a tech guy as one does right now we buy condos in miami apparently well you know i moved to miami and you got you gotta live somewhere okay and i call up the bank and i said i found this great property i'm really excited about it um and my banker was like yeah but i can't give you a loan and my heart sank because i was so excited about this property and i i mean i was banking on the bank you know and i said why you know i've and he goes well uh you know you started a new company you work for yourself you know you don't have w2 income um i'm sorry but you you know chase cannot give you a loan and you know i like to consider myself like i've done some things i've sold some companies i've invested in stuff and i can't get a loan so i was just that's what's been on my mind recently this is crazy i've so i've been thinking about this exact thing in like a number of different contexts recently this whole idea that the traditional financial system is set up for really what is like the old way of working right it's this whole idea of you go get a job when you get out of college you work for 40 years they give you a gold watch and you retire that's like the way that our parents worked that's how the world has always worked as it were but that's changed a lot now there's a lot more people taking on entrepreneurial roles there's a lot more people doing 1099 stuff this whole idea of like the portfolio theory of jobs and people doing a bunch of different things the like hustle culture young people taking on a bunch of different um a bunch of different side hustles and building and so the idea that the mainstream financial ecosystem does not work for a huge and growing population of people like you by the way who you have i imagine you could buy the place outright in cash if you needed to so the fact that you cannot get a loan is like crazy to me but i keep seeing this type of thing popping up yeah i think it's gonna be it's gonna happen more and more and there's a ton of like startup opportunities there i think also about you know immigrants so when i first moved from canada to the us i had no credit and it was right after i sold my you know one of my first companies and i literally couldn't even like i went to a t i was like i want a phone and they're like sorry um i had to and you know and that's why a lot of immigrants uh you know use t-mobile which is what i used up until recently like i literally just got off of it because t-mobile i was loyal to t-mobile because t-mobile was the only phone company in america who had my back t-mobile if you're listening like sponsor us do something like i appreciate that you heard it here first for all the immigrants and you know i think like it's better than cricket wireless yeah i mean it's a step up for sure i mean i i was definitely in san francisco at you know in like the downtown area and like my t-mobile reception wasn't working yeah but it's crazy though the point is like so cool that um you know they had my back but crazy that like you know the financial yeah the financial system is kind of stuck in all the rails i mean the rails of the entire traditional financial ecosystem are broken for where the world is heading i just saw this with a close friend of mine this guy josh fabian founder of this business medify amazing company raising money at a huge valuation uh backed by some of the biggest vcs in the world and he is a founder who came from not a lot of means he grew up very poor he had tougher times when he was younger and has now risen to this amazing position he's building this incredible company he moved his company to new york creating jobs in new york city could not get anywhere to accept him to rent an apartment for himself he said i will pay for the entire year outright in cash they wouldn't let him do it because he had bad credit from what his past was and that's insane that we live in an ecosystem and in a world where the rails have not adapted enough to be able to underwrite someone differently than what their traditional system is so what's going to happen is it going to be like the chases of the world innovate or is it gonna be like there's startup opportunities you know creating chase but yeah entrepreneurs or chase for immigrants it's a good question so first off uh the mainstream financial world is not good at innovating i mean you see that big companies in general are just slow to innovate you see that across the board in most industries we both know that they're just not good at it it's not part of their culture it's not part of the dna to move quickly to pivot to innovate so i think of this like i'm a frameworks guy and so in every episode you're going to hear me talking about different frameworks i know you're going to get sick of it eventually but for this one i just keep coming back to what is one of my favorite frameworks which is the clay christensen have you like the so harvard business school professor very famous managerial um thinker and has this model of disruptive innovation and this is basically a framework that talks about how small upstarts can come into new markets and completely disrupt incumbents that are very large and so in the financial world i think this is a great model to think about because you have these massive incumbents like a chase or bank of america or whatever they're doing and what they have done is created this massive ecosystem but what what in reality has happened is that they are either over serving or underserving a ton of different customers and so christensen's model says that there's a huge opportunity that exists for people to come in and really just serve one particular customer or archetype extremely well provide like either the minimum viable product for that one customer or the best potential product for that one customer and use that as your launching pad and as your wedge to then go and expand outwards and so i think when you look at the financial world that's what you're going to see you're going to see people coming in and using this tiny wedge of going and providing the best service for that one archetype to go and expand out and completely take over this ecosystem i mean that's the whole unbundling right i mean this is this happens on the internet in general and that just it's coming to finance last just because finance is traditionally super slow and there's a lot of red tape so regulated so regulated um but yeah i mean totally makes sense yeah there was an interesting i've seen a few interesting ones recently that i want to talk through with you so one that i saw recently was i think it's called carrot um and they do haven't heard of it tell me about it okay so what they're trying to do is creating the financial rails for the creator economy so creator economy has become this big buzzword we'll definitely be having people on to talk about it and go into more depth and we can talk about it in the discord later and jam on it but the creator economy has a very distinct set of needs associated with their finances it's 1099 income yep typically the loan and credit market for those type of people that are earning 1099 is low so you could have a youtuber that's making a million dollars a year on youtube and has a 5 000 credit limit through bank of america and that clearly doesn't work like mr beast has to spend a ton of money on the videos he's making and there's an incredible opportunity for a company like carrot which is what they're doing to go and think differently about underwriting rather than just looking at all the traditional metrics and underwriting that way think a little bit differently and it exists for youtubers it might exist for knowledge creator economy people like sub stack writers the twitterratty you know like all these people that are creating in different ways but what carat is saying is that's where they're going to go create they're going to create the best product for the greater economy and use that as a wedge to take over more of the banking for them they've started with a credit card i believe and that's their first product but then the whole idea of like going to the market with just that very small make it the most amazing product for that customer and go and expand outwards from there yeah that's my whole thesis on how to build products for the internet like not just finance is start with the community and then build the software versus you know build software and then go find a community to attach it so i think like if you're listening and you know you want to come up with ideas that for startups that are going to work like pick a community that you like really connect with that you have like inroads with right so like if you're a creator you know you understand creators needs right so like what are other just off the top of your head um what are other kind of communities that you can see there's opportunity in in financial services we talked about um creators maybe entrepreneurs gage economy is a huge one okay i know i mean a lot of people have jumped into this but like this is this whole idea you and i have talked about this it's like go talk to people just go ask questions figure out what pain points they have figure out what's stressing them out and so like creators if you went and talked to creators and i'm assuming this is what the founders of carrot did they talk to creators and they realize what the hell why the hell do i have a five thousand dollar credit limit when i'm making a million dollars this year it feels ludicrous and so they realize that and now you can create a product create a service create a community around fixing that um same thing for gig economy i mean one of the biggest issues that people perceived when they talked to uber drivers was that they weren't getting paid quickly enough they were getting paid every other week originally or once a month and that didn't work for the way they were having to pay bills pay their gas and so startups came in and said okay we can actually front that it's just an arbitrage product and go in and do that and so like i think a lot of this from just from a kind of way of living standpoint is just opening your eyes and talking to people as you go about your daily life because you end up learning and having all these ideas come up on a daily basis from just going out and doing that and i think when you're to so completely agreed and to add to that i think you know one mistake especially a lot of silicon valley companies do is they don't the product needs to speak to for example the uber drivers and that means has to give them that warm and fuzzy feeling that aesthetic that artwork that copy that combined they're gonna use that over existing financial products or whatever because they're like these people are speaking to me these are my people right yeah i think that's the goal and we do that a lot at late checkout like we help all these companies do that um but i think your point on immersing in the community you know i wanna like i wanna really harp on that because i haven't thought about it that way and it's so important like if you just went and immersed yourself within a creator community right and just talked to people you didn't even have to talk listen be present for it that that is how you garner all of these insights you end up realizing that a bunch of creators don't know how to manage their invoicing they don't know how to manage their taxes they don't know they're not optimizing around um what's a what's deductible expense i mean that's the most simple thing in the world and if you're a creator and you are paying for different things as you go about your daily life most of that is deductible if you're doing it the right way and it'll save you a lot of money at the end of the year most people don't know that because they don't know how to set up different entities they don't have an expensive tax guy because they're just on their own and so in this whole world of like businesses of one that are being built now and the way we are working is fundamentally changing how do you go and create products for these people it's by listening understanding what those pain points are and where they're missing out and being there and immersing yourself yeah did i ever tell you this like what i did 2017 2018 when i went back to college there's like articles i think you know written about this um but basically i was running a a company called islands and it was like slack but for college yeah and i was living in san francisco um and you know and the people around me were just like tech people yeah and i had never like uh you know my i never i dropped out of school grew up in canada where and you know the u.s system's a lot different you know my exposure to like college was like watching like van wilder you know so i we end up hiring a team in alabama which is like the most college area of all time college area and we the team and i immersed ourselves in tuscaloosa alabama and we did a whole college road show where we spent six eight nine months immersing ourselves with you know the students to come up with a product that would work and we landed in tuscaloosa with a product that we thought worked and we left tuscaloosa with a product that worked and it was all through this like date you know daily kind of interaction with college students and i think that's the missing like there's so many great products out there and the only missing ingredient is the immersion so what's the lightest touch like make this tactical if i'm a person listening to this what is the lightest touch way for me to start immersing myself within different communities is it discord is it red like what how would you do it if i if i decided i wanted to go do something like this not everyone wants to hang out in tuscaloosa at a frat party yeah that's pretty heavy that's like a heavy touch approach to community immersion exactly the more lighter that's the platinum give me the bronze like i like the bronzer i guess i could do this at home at night so i think the beauty about facebook groups reddit discord is it's it's these communities right and you can just teleport yourself into these groups and communities so i think it's about making a list of like the the most interesting for example like creator communities um teleporting yourself there and dissecting the conversations and also like creating posts speak their language comment um and then try to get them into like smaller group conversations so if you're in a discord with you know 10 000 people it's hard to actually build intimacy how do you get them into like you know a group chat a whatsapp group whatever of 20 people that's when a lot of the key insights come yeah i think it's so interesting because it applies so broadly it goes beyond like you can talk about it with tech nft is web3 this is huge this is how i learned was i just went and dropped into a bunch of these discords that were happening around the different nft projects and lots of money along the way and did some stupid stuff but i learned a lot by being immersed into the community so it applies to tech i also think there's just really interesting more blue collar like meat and potatoes type stuff with this i was driving the other day and this like biker gang in connecticut drove by me on all their harleys with all of their gear and the first thing that came to my mind was just like holy [ __ ] this is an amazing fervent uh enthusiastic community of people bikers they love it they live in it every weekend they do it and they spend tons of money on this hobby there has to be a ton of businesses that can be built around that community providing them what they need one one of the smartest marketers i ever met i was i was on a flight from vilnius lithuania to new york city don't ask maybe for another episode and the guy next to me was the cmo of harley-davidson yeah and i noticed because he was where he he looked like he looked like the leader of the hell's angels yeah you know he was wearing all leather patches everywhere skulls everywhere and i started talking you know we started talking and he he basically told me that they they do immersion yeah and they you know like that's the difference between harley like harley's an incredible case study around like start with the community and then build with the product yeah and not every business has to be some like massive venture scale business there's something really interesting around creating these micro businesses for those urban communities and you can bounce around and especially with how easy it is to create products now i mean you could go spin up an e-commerce brand for a specific niche community that you found on reddit immersed yourself in on discord wherever it is very very quickly and that's especially true in financial services and fintech right because you don't need that many customers to create a huge outcome and like it's also really easy with the infrastructure that exists mercury this company i have a small investment in it's a bank for startups and their whole thing was the same christensen model of disruption they were like we're going to create the best banking product for startups and this is what we're going to do we're going to make all the things that suck much easier and nowadays they just had to create the customer facing ecosystem they didn't need a banking license actually you could go get a partner bank on the back end so all they focused on was beautiful intuitive design an amazing product and it just works and it works when you do something like that and so i think it's really interesting there's a real opportunity for it um i do think we're at a point where we should bring someone to jam with us on this and we have someone amazing coming in for this specific topic because howard lindsen has a background in all of this he was one of the first investors in robin hood so like when you talk about disrupting financial services what better business exists than that stock twits i know he's an investor in rally road which is a really cool business that's fractionalizing investing in everything opening up this huge opportunity for this investing class the rise of um investable assets so i say we bring him in and let's continue to jam with him here he also invested in islands so smart man so he understands you know niche communities and not going big so let's bring him in i'd love to hear his point of view awesome let's do it all right where do you want me to look we're just having a conversation yeah yeah all right say i get bored i mean that's a lot of pressure all right super excited to welcome you howard sure you're kind of like i've known you for how long 10 15 years since you were 11. pretty much so like two years he's kind of like my like canadian i mean i'm canadian he's like my uncle we both have like skinny legs biking legs and skinny jeans you have skinny legs and skinny jeans but i don't know i kind of feel like we've got like similar vibes you're into community i'm into community yeah i've done finance stuff you've done finance stuff do you feel that way or is this a one-sided thing in community and i believe in community i don't think it's a good business i don't you know it's it's a good it's great to build communities yeah it's not a vc as i've learned over the years you know i is reddit a community for they stalked with the community yes israelite community you know defined community there's different communities within it but it's very hard to build a community so i so so it's it's a term that's thrown around a lot that people should use more carefully you know i think it became a term because of real estate like build a community right and that's very hard to do it just became this sexy buzz word just like everything else in the vc world you capture one word and you're like oh community is the word of the day so we're just going to talk about community and we're going to do mass evaluations at every it's a creator economy everyone's like oh creator economy if you put that in your pitch deck it's a hundred million dollar post money valuation it doesn't matter what it is yeah well i think we're entering the first time where community has the chance to be worth something from the start because it doesn't have to be vc funded right like i said i don't think community is a vc fundable idea much like need has been in general a terrible these state we need community we need media is it does that mean it should be vc funded no i think in this web 3.0 world which yeah of course i wish i was born yesterday uh even though i've had a good life but like you always say oh fired only the technology had been around we finally theoretically maybe closest to the potential like like we talked earlier of having community start in a way that's that should scale without having to sell your soul for vc money because once you take money that's a different type of community so go deep on that for a second what do you mean by that that's all i have yeah yeah where you stand there all right guys so now talk to me about that a little bit what do you mean so when you say you don't need the vc money you can scale community in the web 3 world without having to go raise a bunch of cash at the outset what does that mean like make that tactical for people that are listening well that's a good question i mean make it tactical i mean of course you can rape everybody there's a lot of money out there so let's just it's 2021 it's october and then the one this will air it's real time so let's say this air is in 2023 uh with editing but no it's it's october 2021. you have uh all the pieces together right you have incredible liquidities so people will fund a lot of different ideas you have incredible platforms both in the old school platforms like twitter facebook uh discord telegram signal whatsapp um you know the risk of of being building on someone else's platform you're their [ __ ] you know as these have said like if you build on someone's platform or if you build on someone's roads or if you build inside you know in someone's backyard be prepared to be sued or screwed um but now we have this whole new super freeway or super highway being built or many of them being built and scaled and they're and they're wired in a way that you can build on top of them because theoretically they're not fully decentralized i'm not quite sure how to label all this stuff yet because i'm not a super technical person i don't think they're fully decentralized but you have a lot of choices and then you can build stuff on top of them and they're open in a sense that like the rules are a little more set like here's what you pay there's fees and in that world these are like open highways where people theoretically can build something and then really think through who they the rules or what community means and then figure out how much money it really needs to build a community and then make a thoughtful decision about how much money i need or what's my real goal of this community and what are the like who do i want in this community um and you know in web 2.0 it really was exciting right like twitter came out and they were open and facebook was open and the vcs all piled in and they were like everybody's open but guess what we learned to make money you have to kind of close things off and you raise enough money the vc starts saying we need to at least show that we intend to be revenue focused or profit focused and that's the beginning of the end and with twitter they were an open api and so at the beginning when we built stock twits it was like a no-brainer i don't know tech um twitter was this amazing real-time product and at the beginning i was like you know when we went to the dollar sign i was like i just want to talk about stocks on twitter but i don't hashtag doesn't really make sense and if you searched hashtag apple or hashtag google there was no context like it could have been i'm going to the market to buy an apple app or or you know i hate google you know like there was no context so when we came up with the dollar sign and said people talk in a certain language there was finally a way to use twitter for like-minded people right just like the hashtag would help you organ so we had a decision to make and at the time i'm not a technical person so we went to twitter and we were like you should just do twitter finance like yahoo finance like all the old companies before but but they were like no we're open you guys just go run with it and you know so we like i don't think i believe we went and raised more money to build our own platform assuming they were going to screw us like you know as bc say you know be careful of being someone's [ __ ] so we had a decision to make like just let it be what it was knowing it would never be a real business or try and create like a fork in twitter system and we went to fork road and that's a hard road to build because now you gotta go build your own roads and you gotta go do your own curation and you got your own garbage and your own like infrastructure to keep up right so you gotta really think through community now in this new world where there's everybody's been on board to the internet now there's hundreds of millions of users and there's more than just one platform that more than just twitter and facebook it's pretty exciting and there's communities everywhere so now you have to decide how big i want my community like for you guys what who is part of that community what format do we want that community to be and maybe everybody owns a piece of the community that wasn't possible before yeah how do you like i'm curious from for your perspective on this great because you're doing a lot i mean you're a community guy by trade but you're doing a lot within web3 now and at the intersection of all this stuff that howard's talking about it's really interesting so like what do you perceive as the opportunities there that exist and like bring that back to to investing and like investable assets everything is investable all of a sudden so we're in this world where you can invest in anything like how do you think this all kind of comes together and what are the opportunities around it well i would i'd actually bring it back to howard yeah and and kind of be like if stock twitch were to be invented today yeah would it be web three enabled would you allow yeah it would have to have shocked that it hasn't been but i think and it will be like it's just in a matter of time um because if i i'm 56 i'm not building anything new i'm like in i'm in uh harvest mode i'm in harvest i don't know what that thing is you're not in the third grade i'm inspired by other people but like my goal is when i have a really good ideas to get drunk and hopefully it goes away the idea it's like the old mesopotamian rules like get trunk and see if it was a good idea the next day but my idea my ideas now are like i'm 56 you know we've been building stock twits for 12 years it's a big company it's profit big company in terms of revenue and profits and um you know we haven't raised a ton of money and but it took a real long time we had to make so many hard decisions along the way in 12 years a long time well i think a lot of founders don't really ask and a lot of venture capitalists don't really talk that talk with the founders at the beginning which is like this could take 10 years like how much do you love what you're doing yeah and those are honest conversations that you know especially when you're building community or a media company these things are grueling like what what uh henry blodgett did at ali insider there's not many people that can do that stuff and there's an investor in henry at the time and ally insider or whatever business whatever you called it in 2007. he was that guy like when i met henry i was like man that guy can take take a blow right like he just keeps coming and so media and community are like very different as it comes to like web 3.0 if i were to build stocks with today for sure but i'd have to pick the right blockchain is it solana is it on polka dot or is it on i mean these names are silly but like is polygon is it flow so there are like complicated decisions and um or do i just build it on discord and just not make it a huge business and charge 20 bucks a month and find like-minded people or just start my own sub-stack or beehive or whatever it is that i'm going to do so there's all those decisions but they're at least their choices right and this goes back to investing you know until robin hood and coinbase and etoro which is etoro's that was an ambassador even before robin hood you had basically you had the 1999 bubble which gave us you know super bowl commercials and nitrate baby and daytech and td ameritrade and schwab and like there's hundreds of of options in 99 and and and even and so you have this big boom in stock trading and uh it's you know people like to make fun of robin hood and coinbase but 1999 these guys were pretty irresponsible these super bowl community where people were like datrin they were glamorizing day trading at your office and there was a you know the e-trade baby day trading from their crib yeah and now we're so mad at robin hood for like with like i'm not saying robin with the writer rawr i'm just saying we're so mad at robin hood for free trading yeah or or you know not telling us the whole truth nothing better before the payment i know exactly the brokers were getting away with but it was a new revolution so now this web 3.0 revolution is an unintended consequence of centralization you had centralization everybody's like so worried about facebook how do we regulate facebook guess what didn't need regular i mean obviously you can regulate them all you want but they're not in web3 they're stuck in web too they can't get libra off the ground they're not in polkadot they're not in solana they're not in bitcoin maybe they're hoarding bitcoin and driving the price up we don't know um but even if they're hoarding bitcoin what are you gonna do with it it's just gold at this point and if they're hoarding ethereum good like what does that mean to them so and they're not in the in the compute business theoretically so they've been disrupted by just technology not the regulators they're disrupted by printing money so good that they just forgot like there's other technology that's going to come along so that's why our investing is exciting so you know full circle because we like talking about investing you know you had the internet bubble and then you had basically two choices you know stocks and bonds and the government has slowly made bonds there is no bonds it's the government yeah so basically you know it's stupid it's rigged or whatever you're going to call it and and 100 of the us population owns bonds they may not know it or their financial advisor is recommending it and the only decision is do they own 20 of bonds or 30 or 40. and while all this is happening everybody's been allocated by their financial advisors some kind of portfolio web 3 comes along which is basically just a new stock market right and which is why the argument about whether the securities or not it's silly they're just stock like they're securities for sure uh people are buying and selling them and everybody's arguing about semantics they're just securities so eventually they got to be regulated or called the same thing as what stocks are but really they're a response to like 40 of the country's assets they're in bonds which are just a government regulate i don't even know what they are they're just terrible and or they're a bad investment at zero percent or two percent interest rate so you know not to get too in the weeds but when someone who has 40 of their bonds can theoretically take five percent of that money put it into a crypto and stake it at an earn eight percent or six percent a year they basically got the exact same return using one fifth of what they were using in bonds and now they have all this free money to go take extra risk so we live in this world where the government printed money technology's doing its thing covered added a new twist and i have three massive things happening at a time when um you know people have all this extra free time and boom you know as i like to say speculation has become entertainment and so gladiators when the romans had all this time and they were fighting wars and moving people in rome just said you know what we got a lot of [ __ ] time let's have people kill each other and we'll watch kill some lions whatever and you know that's what people did this time they're trading and if they get killed here's what getting killed is in 2021. you lose 30 grand on this stupid ass trade right you put it on reddit guess what yeah you got killed on your face and you didn't die you just blew up your account so gladiators in 2021 is showing reddit that you blew up your your your 30k account guess what you dust yourself off yeah this is what the media doesn't get yeah you're an idiot maybe but you just you just learned something that you were never going to learn it's the man in the arena it's the man in the arena exactly you have a second life yeah and you'll get two gigs and you come back strong with 10k yeah and maybe you approach it the different way this time yeah that's investment yeah it's also the ultimate the gladiator analogy is really good because it's like the whole thing that happened in january with melvin capital and the gamestop they're just acting like god they're just and it's but it's literally like the reason those people became heroes like boring kitty and i don't know who they were if they were heroes they were just in the media i mean like in but again investing is the purest form yeah you are on the ground lines are coming at you people are yelling in the stands but at least you're not risking your life that's the digital version of gladiators what we all now get to be melbourne capital for a day for a lifetime and whatever but our our account is the true truth yeah if it's 10 grand today what's my goal it's not to go to zero it's to go to 100 okay so how there's a million ways to go from 10 grand to 100 it is a game everybody's arguing no one wants to admit it that investing is a game call who cares what you call it the goal is to go upward to the right and some people want to do it overnight which is hard and it carries extreme risk and some people are willing to get there over 10 years but you don't know until you start and so now people all have a chance to stake themselves 100 grand or whatever and everybody's arguing about what we're going to call this which is silly in the meantime young people are just doing it the other thing that's interesting about it to me and you brought it up is we're in this new environment where it's not the establishment people within the financial ecosystem that have access to these like arbitrage plays of generating outsize returns anyone anyone in this room anyone here can go and do these unique staking mechanisms within the web through ecosystem and generate outsized returns right now right in this environment and that is a fundamental shift it used to be that it was only like the insiders that were able to do this and so the insiders are pissed because suddenly anyone joe schmo on the street is able to go and do these things generate those returns and so then they start calling it and cnbc comes on the air and they start talking about how it's bad for the ecosystem and how these people are going to get wrecked and it's going to be this terrible thing i think it's just oh there's been a generational shift in the ability to go and generate returns suddenly anyone can do it yeah i mean it's a really good point again we got to choose our wording carefully because not everyone has access sure like we like to think this is what got robinhood in trouble this will get anyone in trouble we're democratizing this no one's doing anything these are all on-ramps to what we love which is the internet it's the same thing with people bragging whether it's chamoth or me or anybody brad jason calcan it's a bull market it's hard not to make money that's true so everybody's bra it's the internet before the internet a lot 90 of businesses fail the last 20 years you got to be really making really bad decisions to fail doesn't mean it's no shame in it but you've got to make more bad decisions to fail in an internet era than in a retail fixed world era the cloud expanded the playing field okay so and then you throw the money printing in it's very hard to lose money okay people need to like just stop thinking they're that smart now within that car everyone's a genius in a bull market this has been on a never-ending boom which is fabulous call it what it is but the point is now the table stakes have been lowered you can fractionalize your body right we wouldn't be here where we were vanguard had said 10 12 years ago they were already figured out fractionalization when you bought the s p 500 they knew that you could buy 0.5 shares of apple like they had figured this out all they had to do vanguard is say we're opening our api like we're going to allow people to buy the s p vanguard 4.99 like i would like to buy 500 stocks and i would like to take out wells fargo and goldman sachs and tell them that i took them out text them for me and say [ __ ] you goldman sachs and wells fargo what what vanguard decided to do is not offer that technology to everyone else you had to buy the s p 500. that pissed entrepreneurs off they didn't know what was pissed about it sure pissed me off it's like wait a minute betty lou wakes up she hates wells fargo she hates lehman she hates bear stern she hates goldman sachs 2008 but she wants to participate in the s p 500 she just she wakes up and every month she's [ __ ] contributing money to wells fargo goldman sachs whatever like that was infuriating people even though no one was talking about it so basically all that's happened in the last 12 years and beyond is the unbundling of vanguard right i want to own the s p 400 less v6 destructive car along the s p 294 yeah and people just it took a while for people to and we're still not even explaining what it really is vanguard had this yeah there should be no robin hood there should be no any of this stuff it should all still be cnbc and vanguard and goldman sachs they just didn't give their technology they hoarded the technology they stayed closed they stayed closed i love that the unbundling of the s p 500 that's all it really is and it's mind-blowing in the sense that it took so long yeah right we went yeah and this is why we have an explosion finally people have more than 31 different flavors like basket of ramen this is like um dorn bush's law it's like these things take much longer to happen than you think especially when there's much especially in finance yeah because of the regulation right yeah and that was very hard for me as a financial believing in fintech before fintech was the thing it was like i was way early and it's very intimidating when you can't re i don't i'm not a tech person so i didn't know how to express it because s p made sense because i couldn't beat the s p 500 you can't beat them join them but there's something just so maddening about it that wells fargo could act badly and if you put a hundred dollars a month in your uh 401k they were getting it doesn't matter how badly they behave the game was rigged yeah they wake up and they're getting started they're stockbot that's corrupt as corrupt could be even though john bogle had great intentions yeah and this is why i believe first of all passive investment was a lie there's no such thing as passive investing with vanguard is a very active portfolio every month or quarter they kick out poorly performing companies so it's a quant fund um so people are really buying an active portfolio it's just packaged as passive and so we've never been passive um because passive is a dumb idea you should you should garden if you let your lawn just grow yeah it's gonna look like she had same thing with manscaping if you let your you know your balls hair grow you're not gonna get laid according to young people and i say that as an investor in landscape but like great company by the way it's an amazing company and it's so much like investing when we looked at manscaped at the beginning and the kit and paul is a really great entrepreneur and i just thought it was a genius idea yeah because i'm disgusted like once you hit 50. it's not about landscape it's about i can't even look at myself in the mirror i'm disgusting and so you're grooming whatever you're going to call it you're just shaving all day because you just are repulsed by your own image and um something to look forward to oh it's terrible it's terrible i told you which is why you get married which is why you get married the uh especially i mean if you're single and 50 you're screwed you're shaving all day constantly yeah this is why i got it and then once you shave they don't tell you this you're shaving forever like the the stakes go up just hair grows and crazy it's just like terrible i think i know my big idea from the day no but so anyways when he when he was pitching us manscape i went to my nephews and and i was like they're all 20 i'm like the same genius but guess what they all told me they were embarrassed to admit that they manscape because it's none of my business so we got bad information from our the actual user of the product it's no different than trading like if you ask people if they did trade or trade they're going to say no i'm a passive investor so again this is just people sometimes the the you can't get the information even if you ask the right people and so manscape work so well is because they offered a product that people wanted and no one was admitting to and that's just when you get outlier wins and they created the same way robinhood people go i don't believe people are training no it's what people wanted they didn't know that they wanted it yeah until it was presented in a design in a package that made it just incredibly appealing free training had been around for a while uh zappos echo you i remember you talking about and i passed it on because it was it but it was desktop and it just didn't it was before the iphone in many ways and it took the iphone and it took robin hood and who knew it would take to 2014 was when robin has launched that's like not that long ago it should have happened in 2007 or when the app store launched so it took a long time and no one can predict the wind and the why but indiana was a great packaging it was it was a latent or there was a demand that no one was admitting that they had and then you obviously had the money printing in covet and then you had crypto and you had all these extra choices and you had fractionalization and you had all this unbundling and it's like bam and now people are like it's bad i'm like back good luck trying to put that back in the box there's no [ __ ] all at once that's the same like people are saying what just [ __ ] figure out a tax yeah and figure out something fair and let the people and you can't put the genie back in the bottle no and and when you say education because i agree education but what does that mean here's what it means give people a list of people who's like i don't even know how you educate people they have all these tools at home they're not going to learn it in school the parents are going to they're on discord they're on stock twits they're on twitter they're on telegram they're hearing rumors they're hearing things they're playing with things before other people they're using roblox let them i think they're shaded by getting punched in the face and like you're better to get punched to face when you're 20 and you're going to have five grand yeah exactly when your parents hand you 30 million that they were hiding like they did you know they like you do estate planning give your kids 30 million then you're going to teach them how to yes yeah but we'll have that doesn't make sense we'll get punched in the face it'll we'll learn there'll be a cycle it's how it works but i do think that like you you're learning through playing the game it's not what do you think of the whole like nft space right now i'm curious i'm just so fascinated forgetting the terms and everything i'm just first of all i'm happy but it's scary because i'm old and it's just i wish i could you know stay in the discord rooms like discord wasn't built you know stock codes was built for what it is ticker based search it's genius twitter could have been there and still can't theoretically do it or buy their way to do it discord and slack are communities like they're not based on like real time right looking at an object you know so you know something new will come along or we'll keep innovating at stock like you know it's up to us to to think how people like searching for things but what's amazing about nfts is no one knew even the best crypto people like they were just bitcoin ethereum and you know then nft is just what yep you know it's taken still people are arguing if it's a thing of course it's a thing people are doing it yeah you can't deny something that people are doing and having an endless amount of fun yeah and it's 24 7 365. yeah it's [ __ ] it's for thoroughbred you have to be you can't just be some fat bond trader you have to understand community you have to understand technology you have to understand how to behave you have to have social skills you don't have to be on a high-rise you don't have to be in new york or san francisco this is matt this is where the democratization doesn't mean it's open for everyone you still got to like engage yeah and you got to show up at the stadium what's your effort you can make it's not serious money yeah of course it helps to have a stake yeah and okay i love that that's never going to be fair some people are born on third base i'm bored on third base we're lucky okay i don't know i can't put it back in the box i'm not going to apologize forever i'm just going to pass on the information that i think i can get but everybody should be building a stake somehow it could be through your one domain exercise as steve martin called it your special purpose back in the movie the jerk you know everybody has a special purpose they sent him out onto the street he didn't know what he was doing he was just hanging he spent three days in front of his house because he didn't know what to do in the movie the jerk but everything comes back to some movie that we saw 30 years ago eventually he figured this [ __ ] out you know and he got his first woman and went to the circus and people should go watch the jerk it's much it's a little it's a lifestyle oh my god i got to see it yes you should so um these are just things that are rights of passage and i have two you know i'm an empty nester with two kids out in the world they're learning you know get your first apartment in new york you know like these things have to happen covets slowed down that that process and jiren coveted kids had time so they learned how to trade they were just bored i know we're running up here at the end of time so want to wrap up maybe just each one of us like your one big idea like what was your what was your big takeaway i feel like i learned a ton just from the 20-25 minutes that we had with howard so what was it for you i mean my aha moment like i've never thought of the s p 500 as fractionalization you stole mine you know they figured it out right like they had to make this for like unbundling the s p 500 that like i've never thought of it that way seriously that was amazing i was like this is a new thing yeah you know rally road etc like this is new yeah but it's kind of all that's new is old yeah yeah i think raleigh is too new what took so long for riley and i'm an investor in riley rhodes talking my book what i loved about raleigh i'm not a car collector but i love the idea of fractionalization rally was so far ahead of its time because people really hadn't yet um hadn't been honest about what we were really doing which first you had to unbundle the s p robin hood needed to exist and nfts needed to exist actually before rally world became cool because nfts are purely digital rally roads like training wheels for a digital world right so rally was too far ahead and now the time is there but it took nfts for rally road to be cool because for people that can't go full digital and but let's just say that's 99.5 of the population still like let's be honest mfts are really early still because even i'm not doing it at any kind of interest level i want to but i'd rather go buy a crypto punk a piece of a crypto punch on rally or at least i feel i own it and the sec approved it like there's different levels of the game and you have s p 500 it's great that guard and there's a million ways to do it then you have blow your brains out like take your chance spin the wheel learn how to play the game build your own portfolio then there's that at scale which is nfts and make your own portfolio and then there's it's just too hot to lose too tight too you know there's something for everybody yeah so we covered a ton we're going to get into a lot more in the community i know we're going to be in there after this releases jamming with all of you super excited to do it this was a blast i learned a ton the unbundling of the s p500 blew my mind a little bit so i'm excited to dig into that more appreciate your time howard this is your blast thanks for coming on the first episode of the room where it happens cheers cheers good to see you good to see you were the cameras were the cameras going i hope so [ __ ] okay one more time all right howard what a legend that was fun having him in here that guy is a legend yeah he's fun man he's a fun guy to be around i never spent time with him in person so it's really fun um so we got to get takeaways what was your one big takeaway from that conversation i think a lot about unbundling you know i've written about the unbundling of reddit i think that's huge when he mentioned the unbundling of the s p 500 for me like that blew my mind and i think there's a bunch of areas that you can unbundle that like people are not thinking about a lot of people think about you know now especially on bundling of reddit unbundling of facebook unbundling of instagram but what are some lesser-known areas which you can unbundle again bundling a spotify you know the unbundling of airbnb etc etc so i'm like tonight i'm gonna go make like a map of like a bunch of areas which i could go and bundle and i'm pretty excited about that yeah it sounds like a fun conversation to have in the community as well so we should pop in after this episode releases and we will get in there and talk about all this because that sounds like a really interesting one yeah what do you think should be unbundled next so for me my big takeaway from today goes back to early in our conversation we talked about what i brought up that framework the clay christensen model of disruptive innovation and this whole idea that you can just provide the best product or service for a very niche customer and use that as your wedge to take down an entire industry you can go in and it goes to that same point of unbundling but in financial services in particular which was where we talked about it there's an amazing opportunity to do that these incumbent players in a lot of industries but financial services in particular are playing this game where they are so wide reaching that they're not actually providing a really good service to anybody anymore and if you want to come in and find a market where you can be the best provider for x customer it's a pretty cool opportunity that exists out there so that was it for me that's a big light bulb there's a big light bulb and i think it applies broadly and so i'd be excited to get in there get in the community we'll talk about it after the episode and we're excited to engage with you all on this so look forward to it and until next time from the room where it happens cheers

what frustrates me most about the current state of podcasts is just that it's one-sided it all ends as soon as you finish the conversation during the interview it's an interview you talk to someone you ask them questions and then it ends and that's it that's all you get from them and so when i think about the opportunity that exists it's changing that fundamentally flipping it on its head making it a conversation following up digging deeper going further with all the insights that's how we take this entire thing to a whole new level i'm sahil bloom i'm an investor creator entrepreneur writer i also gave up a grand slam on espn in 2012 and i am still waiting for it to land i'm greg eisenberg and i build community i'm the ceo of late checkout an agency a studio a fund where we build some of the most popular internet communities i believe the current state of podcasting sucks a few people have microphones and it's just not fair what if you allowed a bunch of people to have a microphone so they could connect so they can collaborate so that they can build community and that's what we're trying to do with the room where it happens it's a place where we could have honest conversations about how hard startups are what's interesting to us how we can collaborate how we can build businesses together and what the next big thing is this is the place where the conversations happen where ideas are batted around debated fought over this is where things actually get created where you start to have those seeds that are planted and where things are really built that is the room it's traditionally been closed we're opening the door to it we want you to be here with us as that happens greg and i met in the room where it happens we met through the confluence of a bunch of chance events we were in a group text thread together with a handful of friends and became as close as we are today because of that the gap between what people think business is and what actually happens is what scott belski calls the messy middle think of the social network the movie mark zuckerberg starts facebook and then all of a sudden it's massive it's this romantic idea that people have about startups and entrepreneurship in reality the messy middle the time in between starting and the outcome is 99 of business and startups and entrepreneurship and i actually find that messy middle to be the most amount of fun it's when you rise up it's when you fall down it's when you zig then it's when you zag if this podcast were available five years ago for me i think i would have meaningfully accelerated the trajectory of my own life and my career and part of that would have been the insights generated the things i learned from actually listening to people but the biggest part of it would have been the people i met the relationships i built with other community members with the hosts with the guests that is what is the force multiplier for your career those networks how that compounds over time just as well as any financial investment watching where you are today and where you're going to be tomorrow and where you're going to be a week from now a month a year 10 years we're in this for the long game and what excites me about i mean the reason why i got into community was because i love seeing people progress advance do big things and i know that being a part of the room where it happens good things [Music]
