so I really started the year my word was publish and I wanted to do dope things with dope people I was like what am I going to do I looked back through my bookmark tweets it was how to build a company in 2023 so whipped up a quick graphic tweeted it bing got a DM from Greg who are you building with people that get you fired up it's such a hack everyone runs on batteries so you have to figure out what charges and drains yours burnout occurs when your batteries get drained and it doesn't mean you've worked hour weeks it doesn't mean you are like burning the candle at both ends it probably means you're just doing things that don't get you fired up this is a special special pod holiday edition ideas Galore Lessons Learned in 2023 it's going to be an iconic episode we've got Theo my co-founder and lay checkout who has been on the Pod before one of one of the best most listened to two episodes of the year so he's back and then we've got Jordan who's a new face and a new partner operating partner at Le check out the holding company and I'm excited to have you both in the room great to be here yeah stoked blessed to share this uh fine room with Jordan for the first time big shoes to fill for the most downloaded episode see so let's get started uh we've got a lot to cover um and I'm G to start with you Theo uh what are some takeaways you have from 2023 uh building up building at our holding company lots of takeaways first Greg I want to say that one takeaway is I still love building businesses with you so that's a good one um Jordan you too now that you've joined the roster it's been a it's been a treat still fun to build um so one of them I wrote down when building a business most things boil down to desired outcome plus trust sounds really simple maybe sounds even really obvious but man after the Reps that we've taken in selling in building teams and speaking to customers across different businesses those are really the two things that matter is desired outcomes what is the goal of the person that you're speaking to and Trust do they trust you to get them there to achieve those goals to achieve those desired outcomes and many people have spoken about this many people have talked about this but really when you're able to understand what people want and then have them trust in you that you will get them there especially in sales where you have a narrow window to be able to do that if you can master that everything else is gravy so if you use that framework that has really helped me at least think through writing copy on websites and going into sales calls and speaking to prospects and even building the team and speaking to folks we have uh on the team and figuring out what they want and how we can build trust and maintain that trust to help them achieve their goals so that's been a big one I have a lot more to say on that um if you want me to keep going yeah I mean trust I mean I could listen to that and be like yeah like that's obvious like the more someone trusts me the more likely they are to buy my services uh or join my team or you know do whatever I want them to do but how do you go about actually building trust and yeah what have you learned about how you can do that efficiently yeah so I call it the three C's of trust credibility competency and connection those are the three things that you're trying to get to as quickly as possible and in the most effective way that I've found and I could be wrong and there's probably a fourth and a fifth and a tenth but for me those three C's matter a lot so right off the bat I try and form some level of connection um and that to me can be across a lot of different threads um but give you an example in a sales call the other day is someone came in and they were building a sports media Empire and right away I figured out what this person's favorite sport was which happened to be basketball I don't know if you guys know this or not but I took a brief run at the NBA it ended early when I was 15 but you know I went for it um and so right away I was able to call back to some basketball talk that brought me back to my childhood in early days and we just jammed on basketball for a while and then we talked about the NBA for a while and then we talked about sports in general and playing sports and before even talking about what their goals were their desired outcomes were I wanted to as quickly as I could form a connection with this person that separated me from from everyone else he was talking to and so that was one way to kind of form the foundation for that for that call and I do this time and time again is I always look for a tether a thread where I can form connection and then after that how do I demonstrate competency and credibility in that call so understanding their goal ask a lot of questions and then use some examples that showcase credibility we've done this before Greg is the CEO etc etc and then competency is just jamming on potential solutions that could solve their problem and talking through their product or their problem and typically that seems to be a winning formula I also think that there's so much you can do with building internet audiences to build trust like content is the sale salesperson that works for you 247 like we're recording this once and thousands of people are going to listen to this and a bunch of people are going to be like whoa I like what these guys are saying I want to hire these people to innovate my Fortune 500 company or design this crazy website or build a new app or whatever it is and we might be sleeping we literally might be sleeping or we might be on the beach or we might be you might be you know shooting Hoops Theo I know how much you uh you like your hoops from Beyond The Arc just every time brick brick brick yeah yeah so I think building trust is is definitely huge and I do I like that framew work and but I I do think that you know investing in content is such a efficient way to to gain internet trust so that if you are if you're you Theo and you're you're having a meeting with you know the CMO of Adidas and you're trying to sell them a million or $2 million dollar year contract to help them build their business you want to have that first meeting that they know who you are and they know the work that you've done so you're not just like coming in blind absolutely and I think that that ties back to the credibility that competency and that connection and that's where content can be a huge level up for all of that because in a sea of sameness where a lot of people can compete on competency and credibility potentially if you're in that type of Market where there's a lot of people playing in the same space connection might be your best bet to stand out and if you've put out content consistently I know I'm saying a lot of CW right now so I'll pull back um um you might be able to build connection over time which you Greg have done masterfully and Jordan has started to do and our brands are starting to do is how do we speak to people in a way that they're connected to the brand and then demonstrate competency and credibility Jordan anything to add yeah I think like that equation is it credibility plus competency and then connection is almost like the the multiplier on top of that so you can do connection on the internet through content and that's like a micro amplifier but then when you make those connections behind closed doors or in decks Etc that amp that amplifies it even further Jordan what have you learned I know you've been at lay Cheo now for under a year but what have you what have been a what's a really big takeaway that you learned in 23 that you're you're pulling into 24 totally I think uh it's around this idea of productized Partnerships and really becoming a trusted advisor and partner for people um I think productize Services were a big buzzword in 2023 and somehow that became an outbound marketing strategy uh when it's really for internal use only uh to help run the machine more smoothly but really changing a productized service which is more of a transactional task base um deliverable which is somewhat of a commodity and turning that into a trusted partnership which with a productized partnership getting on the same side of the table as the client and really providing a becoming a trusted advisor and that's really where like novelty lies um so like responding and providing strategic demand instead of just um creating demand based on tasks I think is a has been a really big takeaway toward the end of the year that I'm pumped to bring into 2024 but how do you like that sounds good right sounds like yeah of course be on you know if be on the same side of the table but how do you actually if you're building an agency or building a service-based business how do you actually Implement that into your offering totally yeah it's I think it's tough and it's interesting on a caseby casee basis but I think going back to the connection piece of it it's like slowing down to speed up like what are you actually offering the client what are you trying trying to provide them and like actually aligning with their goals instead of trying to make your mrr go up or you know just close the next deal and move on I think really aligning with where they're trying to go where they've been um and pairing that with an offering like slow down to speed up painfully uh um obvious but yeah I think that I think that's really that's how I think about it at least is like actually being a partner right yeah you can't just can't just be words on a website you have to structure your offering so that it really means that and I think that's where a lot of productize services are going to fall flat is they're going to be a service that of course Pro provides some value but I think that in an AI generated world like people are looking for partners not service providers um because service providers are just going to be tools like chat BBT or tools like Bard and D and stuff like that uh where the value really is is in the advisory and the partnership and I think people are willing to pay for that um Jordan I feel like we would be doing people a disservice if we didn't tell people the story of how we met and I'm curious if that was a takeaway for you in 2023 100% collaboration permissionless apprenticeship uh over solopreneurship and Building Things um with people that don't get you pump so I started the year working uh on an agency that I had built it was going great the p&l looked amazing you know profitable everything but I just wasn't fulfilled at all um so I really started the year my word was publish and I wanted to do dope things with dope people I made a little list and Greg you were on that I don't even know if I told you about this list um but it had like some five people on it Jack butcher was one of them shout out visualiz value of course um he's he's created uh a business that he runs seamlessly and doesn't need me uh respectfully um like Sean pory was on there a couple other people were on there but I just aligned with what you were doing and Theo I didn't know you um you were just amazing sprinkles on top of this cake but I was like what am I going to do I looked back through my bookmark tweets saw a tweet that Greg had posted I think it was like November of last year it was how to build a company in 201 23 I'm decent at design a self-taught designer so I was like how can I add value to Greg he has this 50 character tweet it's a banger but people don't aren't really going to resonate with just words so whipped up a quick uh graphic tweeted it bing got a DM from Greg who are you and this was from like a little do within account my little like side brand and it was like literally zero followers I started it like not long before that and Greg said it had double digit followers I I I had 18 followers and I was like really is someone yeah I was sending this DM I was like I don't know if anyone's gonna respond to this yeah well I responded we jumped on a FaceTime immediately I think it was like January 2 or something um just get gearing up for the year and we just started jamming and I wound out of that agency and was more than excited to take the opportunity to come join and build with you guys and I think that's like one of the biggest takeaways this year to is just like building with people that get you fired up that you can align with is so much better than doing it either as a solopreneur or even with a team that doesn't necessarily align with the way you think it's such a hack of Life fulfillment um to build with people that get you amped so well I I just just pulled up the DM with with uh do within and January 2nd right January 2nd 2023 I I send a message and we'll put this if you're listening to this on Spotify or apple get to YouTube subscribe and and watch it on YouTube to see it um to see the visual but I go love the image at 4:01 p.m you go thanks Greg too good not to visualize at 4:03 so you like responded pretty instantaneously uh you were ready to go and you know it's not like you were hung over from January uh December 31st January 1 thing like you were you're ready to hit this year with a bang so I go what's your name and then you send me Jordan mix as your Twitter and then you write your name Jordan mix which is intriguing just by like I know your last name is not mix like but it's cool like that is a cool the fact that you like put essentially a nickname like I'm interested say say more then all I do is give you my phone number curious to learn more about you FaceTime me 4:22 p.m. 4:25 p.m. word will be a 901 number so in less than 30 minutes we get on a call and I was basically like we got to find a way to work together and your life changed 100% it was dope it was dope it was dope so everybody for both of us like in my life changed too you know what I mean like for all of us guys all of us don't forget me you know it changed my life as well it you know it goes to show you like send the DM you know put stuff out on the internet Get Loud on the internet and uh if you're not afraid of rejection and you're not afraid of like meeting strangers on the internet uh that's the beauty about the internet right like it's weird to meet a stranger in person sometimes for safety reasons but if Jordan was weird and we were on a FaceTime I could have just hit that end call button and feel like that was a weird way to spend January 2nd but uh the upside is high and the downside is low yeah 100% you got to do it like they might not be liking but they're watching so like even if your tweets get a 100 Impressions that's 100 people seeing it it's pretty crazy if you pick picture of 100 people in a room that's wild so I think more people should just publish more stuff and there's a lot of benefits other than just follower count I don't even think follower count matters that much uh other than like some some uh verified credibility but yeah send that DM baby Theo upon reflection 2023 what else have you learned I want to build off this you uh Jordan did a good job of building credibility and forming connection there so way to steal my trust formula in J in January before I knew it existed um building off this uh and Jordan's kind of take on you know your agency and where you are today with late checkout is that everyone runs on batteries so you have to figure out what charges and drains yours um that is I guess it wasn't a learning in 2023 but a a real big reminder um that you know people projects problems to solve what you do outside of work they all have an impact on your batteries and you have a finite number and some people are running on a cybertruck battery and some people are running on ablea so you know know how much you got in the tank but at the end of the day things drain and things charge your batteries and do more things that charge your batteries and way less that train them yeah nice I love that you still have doublea's um so I think like burnout occurs when your batteries get drained and it doesn't mean you've worked 60h hour weeks it doesn't mean you are like burning the candle at both ends it probably means you're just doing things that don't get you fired up and or with people who kind of grind your gears or taking energy away from you instead of building you up and charging your batteries so you know we've worked with people who I'd scratched my head and didn't understand why they were feeling burnt out I was like you're working pretty reasonable hours it's not like you're even capping 40 hours a week the project seems exciting but I just had them in a role that they weren't thriving in so I had them trying to ship content or ideate on a new product when really they were best at program management and or you know internal operations and so when you figure out getting people in the right place and allowing them to provide value and succeed that gets people really fired up they see momentum that gets people even more fired up that charges their batteries so seemingly putting people in situations where from your perspective might be like why are they not performing or why are they feeling this way just ask yourself are they in a situation where their batteries are getting drained and I think yeah continue to move everyone towards that charging area and you're going to see incredible productivity and just a lot of Happiness a lot of fun so that was another fun reminder this year of uh yeah figuring out what those things are and doing more of them I like that yeah I like that I like that I think uh it's tough though it's like you want people to do enable them to do their best work at the same time sometimes like at a at a startup or in any business like you just have like work that needs to get done so it needs to also align with the needs of the business and it's it's a vend diagram and you hope that overlap is like you know 100% but sometimes it isn't and I think it's also we've seen a shift in in 2023 from prior years for example 2021 where we were just trying to fight to retain as much of our talent as possible uh not just us but all you know startups in general large tech companies and it's moved now from employee to a little more in the camp of employer and I think it's a probably a better balance I think it should be a balance between what employees want to do what teammates want to do and what actually needs to get done and working you know working together to to make it happen but that's a really good one Jordan you have something we've talked about in the past um you know scalable this concept is scalable Consulting um and and you learned that in 2023 could you talk more about it yeah for sure like courses and education is scalable Consulting um after developing email-based courses and courses um throughout the year I think there's a real opportunity to use education as the initial connection building and nurture sequences um but thinking about it what is the dream outcome like alluding to what Theo was saying earlier like what are they trying to achieve and then using that curriculum as scalable Consulting to get them to that that outcome so I think a lot of people are doing courses and writing curriculums that are all about teaching teach teach and they don't really enable people to do uh when everyone wants a dream outcome they're trying to do something they don't really care about learning to do the thing they want to do the thing and learning is usually the byproduct so I think flipping that um and really making education like a core across all of the hold code prop hold Cod properties um has been like a core learning this year and I think we're going to do way more of it in 2024 um and make it multi-dimensional so I think thinking about it as scalable Consulting as that first touch point also helps Downstream effects when you actually offer services or other products so a lot of people probably listen to that and were like no I don't want to do courses I'm too good for courses and because you know it's the c-word it has a it has a has a bad rep and and I get that but I think that the way to reframe it is educate you know people do want education and and I was just at the Apple store the other day and there was like a how to do finger painting on the iPad session and it was packed you know there was probably a hundred people uh doing it and people want to learn right and then they learn about how to finger paint on the iPad and before you know it they're buying an iPad Pro and I guarantee you that apple is investing in that for a reason they know that some of these educational you know they're kind of like courses or educational experiences build trust and Trust will help you sell more and um so I think yeah you're right 2023 we learned that uh the power of education and how education builds trust and how it does allow for scalable Consulting if if if you want um if you want it to be so huge learning um but guys I think we got to get to the meat the meat of this episode which is free startup ideas for the listeners uh things that your are top of mind so maybe let's start with Theo what are some startup ideas that you have that uh people can steal and and get them thinking well off the bat I'll say that uh Greg I still want to hear your biggest learning or one of your biggest learnings or takeaways from 2023 so you're not going to get off the hook that easy and I mean I I'll go I'll I'll say it let's let's hear it I'll say my regret from 2023 flip it on its head let's do it invert it my biggest regret was not doubling down even more like we've got real product Market fit with a lot of our businesses like boring marketing.com is really the best like the the tools that they've built like the AI tools to build SEO optimized pages is like best at class and it's a big it's getting to be a big business but like H how how could we have doubled down even more um dispatch meet dispatch.com how could we have doubled down on that design subscription even more 2023 2024 is a very unique time in technology there's going to be an increased amount of startups that are going to die an incredible influx of talent that is looking for work and opportunities to acquire these businesses for pennies on the dollar and I think our specialty which is knowing how to build internet audiences knowing how to convert those audiences into communities and then knowing how to come up with product ideas and build those product ideas is couldn't be more relevant today and I wish that we took a few more risky bets on Pro on on hires and Acquisitions in 2023 so uh my regret is not being my I guess my my my lesson is don't lead with fear right you should never lead a business with fear um you know at the time in 2023 we're reading the news people are cutting you know we work with some of the largest tech companies in the world on our services business it's like you know they're they're cutting 50% of their staff are they going to retain us and turns out they did we when I look you know they did we shouldn't have even thought about hey maybe we should go grow slower this year so got to trust your intuition man trust your gut can I build off that with one more learning it'll be a quick one um and then let's get into the meat to your to your point it's not a perfect saying and I'm stealing it from somewhere else but I think it goes something like nobody cares work harder uh I think this was from you know someone I heard on another podcast and what I mean by that is like this was a real thing that I was telling myself at one point where I was like oh man like I was I had covid last week and you know Greg's on his honeymoon and oh this person just left the business and oh but we're still here and there and we we'll get back at it and in my head I was justifying or kind of adding this circular logic or this logic to what we could do when and how it would all be fine and that everything would end up how it was going to end up and that there were valid reasons for us being in the situation we were in maybe we were a little bit behind on Revenue targets maybe we didn't make as much one month maybe we lost a person on the team but at the end of the day when I look at my bank account or our business bank account or the client who just left or the person who just left it doesn't matter all of your excuses or reasoning or logic it there are things that are definitely valid reasons to pull back from something and to reshift your focus I'm not discounting that that's that's very true and that happens but I'm saying the grand scheme of things it doesn't matter like what matters is what happens is the output is the results is what you deliver is what is the consequence of that and so I think it was another reminder in 2023 that like I can come up with all the excuses I want but you know at the end of the day it doesn't matter what matters is what happens and that doesn't always mean work harder it could mean work smarter but it just means results actually matter um people have said this a hundred different ways but 2023 was another uh you know reminder another tap on the shoulder to say hey Theo remember no one cares um so let's get into to the uh business ideas and by the way Jordan and Greg are going to be 10x better at this and have better ideas than I will you're just a humble Canadian so that's why humble Canadian who these are going to be straight fire let's go so the way I think about this a little bit um with my overly analytical operational brain is which way is the pendulum swinging and then go where the pendulum isn't or go counterculture go against the grain and so one kind of macro trend is and I think Jordan you'll touch on this a little bit and we jammed on this a couple times is you know Mass connection social networks everything to everyone super crowded not very focused not very Niche AI is taking off you know what is human what is AI generated do people even care and then because of this influx of all this content and all of these images and all of this everything your trusted spaces are crowded your inbox your messaging you know pick the next surface that you hang out on or spend your time on is super crowded and noisy with content that is everything to everyone from things that you don't even know if it's machine or man or woman for that matter so I think more intimate apps which Greg you've been beating this drum for a while on a new Surface is really interesting for those folks who know lockit lockit kind of blew up last year it was you know originally created by this guy named Matt to help him feel closer to his girlfriend when they were in a long-distance relationship and what it does is allows you to share photos and it's a widget on your home screen so you will see you know the photo that was shared by whoever you have in your locket on your home screen in big on your phone and you look at your phone home screen about 80 times a day maybe more in some cases and definitely more for some people maybe a little less for others and so I'm wondering from an intimacy perspective how you own that surface of your home screen or a new Surface and how you create intimacy around that when everything else is so noisy and what would lock it look like in other verticals so not just for your friends and family but for other people who need deeper connections with their fans or customers or whoever else so I like locket for X which is you know what is walket app look like for creators and influencers how do you show up not only in an Instagram feed but on actual home screens what about for athletes your super fans how are they seeing you and staying up to date with that musicians ultimately there these are all Super Fan experiences or or kind of true fan experiences that could offer up so much more and have direct access to your fans you could sell them things but you can also provide behind the scenes content etc etc in this new ET for X mind frame or mind share um so that to me feels like a really interesting one um I don't know where it will go and how you maybe white label it or create a native app but how creators do this and how other folks do this or how other you know call record labels or big music apps or kind of Institutions or associations do this for their athletes I think there's a really interesting opportunity here to supercharge intimacy and own a new Surface yeah so Instagram tried to do something and they're pushing it right now which is Instagram broadcasts and I've been playing with a few and it's I can see the look on Jordan's face it's not it I don't love it I don't love it and the reason I don't love it is this for the reason that you brought up Theo which is people are uh already underwater when it comes to their inboxes so basically the way broadcast works is it's a DM from a Creator in your message box and oftentimes you can react to that particular piece of content and it's like a it's not that useful because like what's the difference between that and posting a feed or posting a story and B get out of my inbox like you know like that space is already reserved it's exactly in your head it's already reserved for your your friends and family exactly so that's where your space is yeah so I like locket for x and I also think that it's worthwhile to pay attention to how platforms are changing so lockit was able to take advantage of iOS 14's widget introduction a couple years ago and a lot of people saw widgets and were like cool that's like looks cute but I you know I'm not gonna develop something and kudos to Matt and team for actually being like what can we how can we push the limits on something like this with a really refined use case um him and his girlfriend and stuff like that so yeah I agree I think there's going to be not only more locket for X's but just in general widgets are really interesting and there's not just widgets on your iPhone but also you know widgets on your Mac and other places yeah such a valuable billboard it's insane exactly when you're looking at that and your again your head space when you're opening that phone it's just it's hitting you so often and you don't even realize it and we've jammed with the team on this the team we have is brilliant comes up with ideas like this all the time and I think one of the Frameworks just before we move on to some of the fire ideas from Jordan and GRE you know some of the one of the Frameworks that we came with Greg in 2020 which you still use today and is still fire is the fun framework for how to build new social minded products and fun is format utility and Niche and I love that framework and it still is burned into my brain on you know how do you own a new format you know tweets or X posts for a new format Instagram's new format Etc locket is a new format utility are you providing utility if you're not you better be providing a great new format for a new Niche and if you are providing utility maybe format's less important but you should have a specific Niche to be serving that that triangle is really really powerful and that framework has been really powerful for us to think about new products jmx we going ideas yeah what you got let's go that's a hard that's a tough act to follow that's that that was 10 on 10 I'm gonna I'm gonna I'll rate all these what about in Canada what about in Canada is still a 10 on 10 well it's 10 it's 10 on 10 us so it's really 13 13 on 10 yeah perfect oh it's converting insane yeah how does that convert to the Quebec dollar though uh or is it not yeah I don't know Jordan what you got yeah so I think about a lot about like maximizing space or uh like putting underutilized spaces to use so like churches for example sit empty 6 days a week bars and nightclubs are empty all day venues are empty most the day most the week sporting events all offseason so I've seen a couple really interesting things this uh one thing called Upper Deck golfing they let you basically do top golf for venues so like Nissan Stadium um Gillette Stadium they're basically doing a tour of all of these these different venues so um that just gives me like a really it's a really interesting trend is um and when you think about what's coming up in the future the Apple Vision Pro is coming up so how could you leverage the Apple Vision Pro and these underutilized spaces and we're going back to the throwback days of the internet cafes going Apple Vision Pro bars what are we doing we're buying 10 Apple Vision Pros we're going to outlay 35k everyone's going to want to try it so you got it baked in you rent it for 50 bucks an hour 12 hours a day you got 10 of them so you're doing 6K a day what's that a month 180k a month in Revenue Thank Me Later Apple Vision Pro bars but is this one of those ideas that works for a year and then doesn't work after a year like I heard some stories still 180k yeah chock it up yeah but then what do you do with all those avps sell them baby or use them rent them I like the I mean to me what's cool about that is you're giving people access to something that they wouldn't have access otherwise and it's not necessarily about the AV P it's about it's about the social experience of like meeting other people when you're going to the bar so like I used to go to like a internet cafe where people could play like play video games and uh that used to be quite popular actually like in the early 2000s and i' I'd show up and I'd rent a computer play a video game and I had the video game at home but it was just more about like I'd go with my friends and we'd meet other people there buy some food and stuff like that so there's definitely like a social club that you can attach to it which could be interesting and that could be could add some longevity to this one month business I tell you what you do you throw on a native experience that you've built in all of the vision Pros that are a lead Magnet or a trust building mechanism for whatever business that you are running Services business Community Etc and it's just a great way to get in front of people's eyes and in their brains through the aps we're going next level subconscious marketing here um and yeah you use that as a great tool to not only give people a new inaccessible experience making that accessible but then also offering them a really cool game or utility or even just wallpaper background kind of design that showcases your capabilities to upsell cross sell offer other things I don't know who the target market would be but there's an interesting play there as well I mean it's an interesting play for like if you did create These Bars and then you went to like a social app or video G like you know epic games and you're like hey you want access to these 20,000 people in these bars well like it's pre-installed with this game and we like are going to promote it and host game nights and stuff like that so that's an interesting monetization model for something like this stack it up Greg you want to go next do a little round table then do another do a round two well well we could uh we can rate this we can rate this one Theo you want to rate rate this bad boy yeah I'll give it a I'll give it a wait no sevens no sevens sevens a cop addent top rating you know the rules no sevens not even with the conversion rate no sevens uh I'll do a solid 8.3 on 10 what yeah wow 180k he wants it for for q1 2024 Q2 it drops to a six on 10 or or lower or lower I mean do I do I have to be honest of course I don't want to hurt your feelings you won't are you just saying that no this is for someone who wants to make 180k and sit on the beach for the rest of the year I'm gonna give it a five5 five five and the reason I'm give it to five5 is you have to it's Capital intensive so I don't like that and I think the the people are going to get the upside are the people who are going to be developing the experiences on the on the platform so just like how we talked about iOS 14 and lock it and how there's so much opportunity there there's so many so much opportunity to build cool interesting spal experiences um within uh the ecosystem like that's where I would be putting the majority of my Cycles is thinking about if Apple Vision Pro takes off what what's going to be the deao dating app what's going to be the DEA facto social network what's going to be the deao you know firsters shooter and just like thinking about and then what are and this is probably the most important question which is what is the most nonobvious experiences that people aren't thinking about that you should you could be creating within this ecosystem what does an ad Network look like for Apple Vision Pro how do you think about buying up all the Billboards within Apple Vision Pro and selling it uh things like that which are non obvious but uh probably pretty valuable if it works out okay I've got another one or Greg you want to go you I'm I like I said before coming on I was like I'm I don't have any ideas that I want to share I just want to hear your ideas you guys are brilliant brilliant folks and people want to hear from you they want to hear from Jordan and Theo that's kind sweet of you okay let's keep rocking um okay this one's a little it's still it's still work in progress but as more info floods the market as everyone is an expert on everything it's hard to know what quote unquote healthy or right or good looks like and let's let's use the word healthy what does it mean to be healthy and what's the best going to diet what does it mean to be this across many different different Industries and so Technologies are evolving super rapidly businesses are operating differently I think people don't know what the Playbook looks like anymore to be healthy and I don't mean healthy only physically I mean mentally spiritually emotionally financially professionally creatively socially what is it look like to be healthy in this new world with all of these new opportunities and everyone feeding you information of what the right approach is with no real credentials including me so don't listen to me if I'm telling you how to be healthy I don't know um um so I think Fitness for X products it's another for X but I love that framework that you put in I think Community College you know 2020 but X for y right what does a fitness product for X look like around these different um Industries with these different kind of headspaces so Financial Fitness professional Fitness Creative Fitness uh spiritual Fitness and how do you build these apps that are part gamification part Behavior change part social part content and it doesn't have to start with an app it can really just start with a niche and start with understanding the people start with a community building content in the space about helping people figure out what that means and then building a product or an experience for them to help change their behavior and on put them on a path to Fitness you know we've worked with Nike we've worked with Weight Watchers we've work with now Beyond barriers which is professional Fitness especially for women in mid to senior level positions they sell these massive contracts to big companies on how to help employees there specifically women admit to senior positions get professionally fit in a way right is how do they achieve their professional goals what is the curriculum who's the community they're going to do it with what's the content and then what are the other offers they can use to help them get there so I think there's a massive opportunity to figure out what the next area of Fitness is and how to build an experience around yeah and the cool thing about so I love this trend and I think it's only getting started I think uh the beauty about it is digital products actually lend themselves really well to gameification like look at dualingo it's like a multi-billion dollar company uh teaching people how to learn a language and that's like language fitness you know I think there's so much opportunity here that if you actually create a tight digital product with utility and then you layer on like a game like experience um in a niche that's purpose built for that uh it's got all the makings of a great business because You' got the moat because it's purpose built so other companies won't come after you there and you're also getting the retention engagement because you've you've got this like built-in leveling system that uh human beings are basically ired to to go and jump hoops through so I like this trend even though it's not like one idea and man I like it Jordan what do you think I love the trend yeah do you guys remember steep in in the web three days they like I mean it went crazy because it was like walk to earn but I think there's something there with with this as well it's just like not necessarily Fitness but just gamification and earning um on some curriculum it' be um yeah there's just a million ways you could take it um who were you talking to recently Greg that had the retreat the creativity Wellness Retreat so a buddy of mine has this really good idea which is basically he's been so he's an artist and he's been or he wants to basically be the creative Wellness guy so his whole thesis is that creatives like other professionals get burnt out and they need places where they can go to actually like come back really fulfilled and although there's Retreat centers for if you're into yoga or now there's Retreat centers for like psychedelics that's like a big thing and although those things exist or or there spiritual uh Retreat centers like go to an ashram in India there actually doesn't really exist a place where where it's focused on taking say a painter and getting them to paint you know paint more or or be more inspired or even a graphic designer like having programming uh so the idea is basically he's building this retreat center and sort of like a farm a farm area where he's hosting like think of like he's kind of like trying to be like the Rick Ruben but for art therapy and I think that's a really interesting play it also plays on the trend around IRL like in-person experiences that people postco are really in the mood for so I think I I like that idea and I think uh branding himself around art Wellness is a really interesting approach to it I it too he should stand up a uh like old western Saloon in the middle of the farm call it writer block right totally well I think I think it's a big opportunity and uh it's one of those ideas that's like hidden in plain sight it's like you have to like take some of these trends like Fitness like that you said you know Fitness and now there's more creatives than ever because people are designing things in real time on the internet and IRL and you community and you put together and you're like wow like there's an opportunity here and the beauty about that idea is like you could start it you can basically build demand online you know you build content online and inspirational content and then you start amassing that Community you build a free community on it and then you say like hey you know do you want to come to my farm um so it's kind of it's a cool idea and you're you're also starting to see just so much demand for places like sooh house um I was at so house the other day and there was like I was telling someone I was telling on it was actually on another pod that like it was like a line to get into a line to get into a line to get into a line to get into the Miami so house and then I was reading that they actually stopped like you can't like join a New York or LA or you know SE house anymore like there's no more weight list or anything like that like they're at Peak capacity why do you think that is well I think a lot of pent up demand postco I also think that people are looking for more Community Based experiences like they want to feel like they're part of something I think a lot of people work from home so they want a place where they can just like open up their laptop and like be with other people so so house I think is going to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of we Works bankruptcy in a lot of ways and in fact they actually have a Soho House workspace business as a part like a a separate business that they from what I remember were trying it in Dumbo and New York and Brooklyn and have probably now expanded Beyond it so pretty bullish on soah house if they are able to maintain quality which is a whole other can of worms which I don't know they're able to yeah I think there's a huge opportunity uh like a blend a middle ground between we work and Soho House yeah like so House's rules are crazy you know you you take a phone call in there and they immediately like tackle you um so it's it's h I think there's like a real opportunity for these like neighborhood work clubs one opened up here in Nashville it's called switch yards and it's really like Bare Bones co-working free coffee 247 access Etc um and it's $100 a month and they went live with it and they oversold memberships like something happened with the Shopify I don't know what but they oversold memberships in two minutes by 800 people and that just shows how much like demand I think for this like Middle Ground could be uh where it's like co-working membership but also eat work play work out yeah um I think there's like a huge opportunity and like making it more like a Lifetime Fitness and less like a Soo house could be interesting for sure I also saw my friend uh Mike K he posted did you see a tweet of his where he talked about like someone should build a SE house but for familyfriendly like somewhere where you can bring your kids did you see that tweet I think I did uh with like daycare services and like yeah exactly I had actually seen it too someone responded I think about lifetime fit Fitness like bro this is Lifetime Fitness but Lifetime Fitness is super suburban and only in America I'm pretty sure don't know people love responding to tweets with like but actually it's you know this already exists as a guy who tweets a lot about like like startup ideas everyone always so many people are are always like well that already exists and it's like yeah it might exist but like a people don't think of that brand it's like or B what if you Niche down more and made it for this particular audience or maybe that brand was created in 1980 and what people wanted in 1980 is really different than what people wanted in 2024 so anyways that was a side rant about people who uh snarky comk exactly yeah um okay rate my burn the startup idea so we can uh get a taste of Jordans although I think we just did which is these localized co-working spots but got a hint what do you got John what's your rating on this on my cop out answer of a category not a specific idea H don't be shy got thick skin there not that's not I like it on 10 yeah I approve this message um no I'm g go I'm g go nine wow I'm feeling it as a category as an idea less than one zero no idea yeah exactly fair enough but the category I like a lot I really yeah I agree I'll give it a nine as well nine on category zero on idea Fair yeah yeah exactly I like it that's fair cool Jordan do you have a another idea you got yeah I got a hyper another hyper local one with I think people are just interested in investing in their local communities um but I think there's an interesting like digital to physical pipeline that's happening that I'm really fascinated with um right now so this one's a little bit of a funny one but let's have some fun next door is terrible there's a bunch of carens on there it's become Facebook it's just gossipy and really just like fearmongering like did you see the Breakin on eth Avenue Etc so we are unbundling or re rewiring next door it went public I think in a spack like4 billion dollar a couple years ago so what are we doing it's called cup of sugar cup of sugar is the friendly neighborhood app where you get to meet your neighbors you can borrow a cup of sugar if you want or you can have a cookout or get someone to have packages picked up off your door um and it's a friendly place to meet people uh I had this idea because I literally met one of my neighbors on Twitter like last week and we ended up being at the same co-working SP space that I was just mentioning um we had a scheduled call but we ended up getting together in person so there's a little bit of a quip on that but I would monetize through mainly ads and um find out about like local hot deals through these um Instagram influencers like every city these days I feel like has like a city guy that's or 10 of them that are viral on Instagram um so I would partner with them to do like local events neighborhood restaurants and it's got to have an annual membership with a coupon book we got to throw back the coupon books for the neighborhoods so free cheese dip free Queso so many Southern things were dropped in that idea my head is exploding from way up here in Canada this is incredible cup sugar this is incredible I love it so the way to do this idea is you buy next door though so you acire next door and you rebranded so next door as of today is trading at a market cap of 666 million devil devil sign 666 and but what they don't tell you is that or you have to look into they also have about $500 million of cash so Enterprise values 166 million so if you bought that business for say a billion dollars or we bought that business say for a billion dollars which maybe we will uh you know don't want to lead with fear in 2024 um go if if you buy that business for a billion dollars you're basically buying it for $500 million um but you get this huge user base like if they've got how many users do they have it's in it's one in three households in America whoa that's way bigger than I thought so guess 100 million people if you're just going to slash it some back of the napkin math right there well weekly active users in terms of active users is 40 million so and that's active so I mean is it crazy to maybe we wouldn't offer a billion but is it crazy to offer you know $10 a weekly active user I don't think so um you know it's 400 million so I think there's this is like a bigger idea around there's opportunities to buy some of these distressed Assets in the public markets from all the spcs and stuff like that and then uh basically modernize the products and also build them with a more profitable mindset so I like your idea I'll get I'll give it a a strong nine point n a 92 what did I give last last time an 83 I'm going to repeat the 83 I'll go 83 again I like it cool and then yeah and how about we do one last idea from both of you okay I'll make this one a quick one call it right hand that's what uh this idea is called um it's not fully fleshed out again I'm going to cop out a bit with the category but um so 99.9% of businesses in the US are small businesses 80% of those are businesses with zero employees that means one person so that's one set of stats another set of stats is influencer the industry the valuation of the influencer industry has 11x in the last seven years you know 2 million influencers today generate over $100,000 a year at least and then there's like a top cohort that's generating well over 500k the problem as we mentioned earlier is a lot of the is single player businesses or kind of solo businesses solo preneurship a lot of these creators that are hitting it scale or starting to scale sorry you need a right hand you can't keep doing it all alone if you really do want to scale there's two ways to scale a business technology and people and or software and people but I like technology as a better um as a better kind of bucket and maybe I'm wrong maybe there's a third and a fourth but those are the two that come to mind Tech technology and people and I was on a call with a Creator today he is going over the million follower Mark but more importantly his reach is like very unevenly distributed if you look at someone else with his follower Camp he gets way more reach because of the quality of his content therefore able to do brand deals therefore able to go after really interesting opportunities and he's growing and making a great kind of sixf figure salary let's call it but he's now at a a ceiling where he can no longer do what he wants to do as a solo Creator or influencer while still putting out content and doing what he does best I feel like there is going to be a lot of people like him and a lot of business owners who start to reach a point where they need a strategic thought partner and someone who is behind the scenes executing delivering on kind of the project management different projects to being stood up and executed so that the business itself can move forward as a business not as an individual and so call it right hand it could be a talent pool of people who are comfortable being number twos in a business and are great operationally and great and reliable from a execution perspective and I hate the term generalist and everyone who comes into a job interview or applies for a job and says I'm a generalist stop please from someone who's interviewed hundreds of people in the last year it's not doing you any service even even though that's what someone might need it's not what someone wants someone wants someone who's an expert or great at something lead with that and then you may be a generalist who can do a lot of other things and that's wonderful but please try and figure out what your your USP is what your superpowers are and lead with that I think for this how do you create a network of people who you know are these super powered number tws or operating Partners or kind of influencer Partners they could work with three at once they could work with four at the beginning and then maybe find the one that best resonates with them and how can these influencers solo businesses Etc pay to have access to this or pay a finder fee or there's a commission-based structure to get access to these people hire them and then grow with them um almost as partners to their business so I know there's been other Solutions like this in the past um for solo Founders but this to me feels like a really interesting moment in time to look into that so high level still more of a trend than it is a a unique business idea but I like it a lot yeah I'm a trend guy I like it a lot and uh yeah I think there's something here roast me and add to it and or just do a quick rating and we can jump to Jordan's J mix I adore it absolutely love it 13 out of 10 CAD whoa that's like a 9.6 us let's go yeah go ahead Jordan no I just I I love love the I think there's a ton of opportunity there um getting high quality people in a network as we know Community um will drive everything and that that specific Community is immensely valuable so no one do this because I'm doing it yeah there you go it's too good it's off the charts uh no I like it I like it I think um also creators want to be creating you know so I think exactly God bless him but you know they're looking for support and you can't do everything so I think there's a lot of opportunity to help creators like you know put it put simply in plain English and I think a lot of them are going to be looking for help so and are looking for help so I I I totally agree and we're seeing a lot of like creators hit us up uh so that we can do that for them so I think we'll we'll get more of that uh I like the idea um and for people listening uh on YouTube please feel free to comment what you thought of all these ideas and give your own rating um maybe we're too generous maybe we're to no s no sevens so that's the rule um and this has been fun this is this is what I'm talking about I knew this would you know this is this is cool this is like what we do off camera so it's cool to be on camera with you guys um where could folks follow you on the internet to get more J mix and Trend Theo trendy Theo oh gosh jrdn MX on Twitter you can find me theot taba LinkedIn Twitter uh or x uh I haven't posted a lot lately but I'll be back in 24 and uh I'll give Greg a run for his money on some ideas so yeah these are jelly jams as Greg mentioned we have these we call Jelly jams you know whenever we can't usually once a month maybe once every couple weeks and getting a taste of them now so hope you enjoyed and if you made it here to the deep end uh and you want to work with us design Innovation growth DM me on Twitter and I'll connect you with the right folks on our team uh and help you transform your business so uh thank you for listening and uh Jordan Theo I'll see you later thanks

the way I've made this a habit for a few years is embracing this idea of comfort challenges so it could be as simple as each day I'm going to do something new or scary or uncomfortable and it doesn't even have to be related to business right it could be building a custom GPT or trying that restaurant around the corner that you've been curious about but it's building sort of this muscle of doing uncomfortable things or doing new things and then when it comes to I heard this uh story from Danny postma of chat GPT precursor he built and sold a company around AI written marketing copy but the way he got Early Access as he emailed the CEO for some people that would make them super nervous but for him he probably had this muscle built up and he's like it makes me a little nervous but I'm going to go ahead and do it and then looks at what that turned into for him right

Small teams have more power than ever.

WhatsApp was acquired for a staggering $19 billion with a team of just 30 people. This wouldn’t have been possible before.

Emerging platforms, media and software allow individuals and small groups to have more reach and impact.

we're on this path of more leverage where individuals have more power and small groups have more power and there are different indicators that you can look for in this of how smaller companies now that are being Acquired and for what price they're being acquired for so if you look at what'sapp I forget the exact acquisition price but let's just say $1 199 billion how big was that team about 30 people okay now rewind 10 or 30 or 100 years ago and are there any comparables no because you have this ability for individuals and smaller groups to have more impact and Nal might say this is because of code and media and platforms where you can just have more reach per person than you had before

Custom GPTs have improved some things a lot, but they're not perfect

If you upload a trend report to your Custom GPT and ask questions about it, you’ll get a pretty accurate answer.

But if you ask it to make new predictions about a new market based on the data you provided, it’s a very different story.

custom gpts right now are not great at execution or content creation at all so if you have a company like a chatbase which gave you that functionality before perhaps they can go to that pocket or for that problem which it looks similar on the surface but they're fundamentally different problems it's a search problem versus a creation problem

Title: Are Platforms Friendly For Creators?
Published: 2023-12-16 13:00:07 UTC
Description:
https://www.youtube.com/@GregIsenberg

The relationship between platforms and creators is a friendly competition. At first.

But it’s not without underlying complexities. 

Platforms initially offer a creator-friendly environment when they’re trying to get liquidity.

But as they mature and try to capture more value, the creator-platform dynamic becomes way more antagonistic.

there's this sort of competitive relationship between platform and creator that exists and it's a friendly relationship at First YouTube is well beyond this but when a network or Marketplace is trying to get liquidity they're very very Creator friendly and then once they reach liquidity they start to try to capture more and more of that value and of course it's hard to replace a Marketplace or a social network because Network effects are so strong to go back to Moes but there is this antagonistic relationship that's also always there whether we talk about it or not

Description:

If YouTube disappeared today, would your audience vanish with it?

In content creation, some risks aren't obvious right away.

While platforms like YouTube are great for discovery and growth, you ultimately want to drive your audience to more owned channels which have less risk.

Always prepare for the unpredictable.

I think a lot of people are bullish on YouTube right now but I don't hear a lot of talk of platform risk and that's another reason why you want to drive that audience to more own channels I'm reading a book same as ever from Morgan howle and he talks about the idea of risk and like Risk is what you don't see and we're not going to talk about platform risk when it comes to YouTube until we have to until there's an event it's like you know it's coming you just don't know when like you can't predict but you need to be prepared so always have that funnel of hey YouTube is great for Discovery it's great for growth but always be driving to a more owned Channel where there's less platform risk

uh startup figured out that the only time the buyer ever switches to a new vendor is when the old vendor dies they literally wrote an algorithm that reads obituaries to find out when vendors of this type die so that they can go pitch to be the new replacement vendor and they realize hey I could buy out the vendor before they die actually would be a pretty good pretty good strategy so anyway you can buy vendors you can buy customer relationship you can buy like stuff what you cannot buy is understanding of the customer so these rollup strategies all depend on somebody somewhere in the management of the new thing actually understanding the business at the level of the customer and what they actually need Eric Reese welcome to the show so excited to have you uh I read your book more than 10 years ago The Lean Startup and I can honestly say I wouldn't be here today without reading that so uh this is kind of cool for me to have you to interview you I'm kind of I'm kind of nervous well don't be nervous thank you for the kind words I'm glad you found it helpful today today what we're going to do is talk about some of your ideas I also brought some startup ideas that I have free startup ideas that anyone could take and I'd be curious your P perspective feedback on them and your brutal honest opinion does that sound cool let's do it you've got a couple ideas here and I want to start with AI companies are funded by different investors than in Prior areas what do you mean by that there's something about AI that has been really different in terms of the kinds of founders that that are pursuing it so you see like a number of the leading AI firms are not funded by the leading Venture firms from the SAS or social media eras not to say those firms have been on the sidelines but it's been it's just it's been different I think it's been notably different who's who's backing it you see a lot more involvement of corporate Venture firms um which you didn't didn't see before there's something about AI as a technology that has is getting people to treat it differently than past Technologies the public is so attuned to the dangers of AI I think people are a lot more interested in who governs these companies and how they're structured how they're governed so that's been a lot of my work of late has been uh trying to talk to people about the startup governance issues that are are unique to really dangerous Technologies uh with with huge upside like Ai and you also see just it's a difference in the kind of Founders that are doing this they tend to be older they tend to be a little bit more sophisticated and I've heard from a number of folks that just feel like the AI Founders are not super pleased with how the previous waves have gone so you know there's a lot of skepticism of people that went all in on crypto or that think that the social media era was a big rousing success certainly a lot of money was made but there have been some pretty negative externalities so I think it's just been interesting to see those issues play out in a new in a new tech wave with new U new backers new funders new Founders we're seeing a lot of you know people call them rapper AI startups in the space like Indie hackers who will take a a use case on top of chat GPT or another llm and just build a purpose-built chat GPT for lawyers chat gpts for something else do you think that there's longevity in those businesses we haven't had a bonified platform war in Tech in a little while because uh Android iOS was not really the real thing I I kind of feel like Google their heart was never really into it so it wasn't like apple Microsoft or Coke Pepsi you know uh Intel versus over the 68,000 Motorola processor like it's just it's been a while since like really meate Tech Titans went to work with each other many people in this era have forgotten the old parable of picking up dimes in front of the steamroller which I believe this ISM applied platform where as originally dates to Jean Louie Gass of BOS and apple Fame but I've actually never had the chance to ask him that's where I learned it from the parable of the of the of picking up di in front of the steamroller is that when you have a platform War the platforms are the Steamrollers so you're building a new platform that many many businesses are going to be built upon think about like Microsoft Windows or the Intel processor in such a situation ation the platform has this tremendous logic and momentum behind it I mean it really is a steamroller it flattens anything in its path you know open AI or anthropic these are very fast moving companies very impressive actually um considering but they're still behemoths and they're still dealing with multi-billion dollar problems so although the steamroller has the power to flatten anything it wants it is intrinsically slow moving you see how old this metaphor is because dimes used to be worth something you see a dime in the path of the steamroller so long as you can run into the street pick up the dime and run out of the street before the steamroller arrives the dime is completely yours steamroll is not going to stop pause pick up the dime is too small for them to care about and the problem with the kind of naive strategy of picking up dimes in front of a steamroller is it works perfectly unless you trip and fall even one time so if one time you go for the dime and you don't get out fast enough then you get flattened by the steamroller and it's and it's dangerous so it's a useful metaphor many of these rapper startups are dimes in front of the steamroller type businesses and the key to the parable is it's it's not bad people are acting like rappers startups are bad that's not bad it's just you have to really understand the Strategic situation that you find yourself in so if you're taking Venture money and you're promising people to build a multi-billion dollar company that might not be the right time to do that but the key for me is always what do you do with the dimes after you pick them up because I think a lot of people start what seem like rapper startups at the beginning but there is a playbook for what to do in this situation if you want to build something with more enduring value so for example um the power of a rapper start is that you own the customer and in a lot of businesses whoever owns the customer actually has the power for the whole what they call a value chain of that industry so I do think some of these vertical specialized rapper companies they might be able to use their werness build up customer relationships collect proprietary data you know I don't know train their own models build their own new thing that is theoretically possible although currently prospects for doing that don't seem amazing but you might also see a situation where in a platform world where the platforms are forced to compete to a lowest common denominator like I saw what happened with Cloud platforms where um the margins get eroded by the fact that the platforms are more or less a perfect substitute for each other there are businesses that can be made where you manage on top of that layer permanently by playing the implementation vendors against each other so you could also Imagine a vertical wrapper that allows the customer to seamlessly switch between many underlying models made by many different companies and because of that those competitive Dynamics might be able to to keep them ahead and then I think there's some people whose goal is to bootstrap their way into their own Steamroller by building the customer relationships collecting proprietary data and then training a whole new model out of that so I've seen wrapper examples where at least each of those that I've just described is the official strategy of why they're raising money and why invest VCS have deployed money against them you can handicap the likelihood of any particular one working in this particular Market boy it does seem like the the Steamrollers have tremendous advantages but there's a strategic logic to it that makes sense and then you also have plenty Indie hackers as you mentioned I'm like glad you started with that because like not everything has to be Venture based to venture back and not everything has to have a 10-year goal and I'm a big fan of building companies with with longevity and long-term thinking that was a big part of my work but the point is to use the right tools for the actual underlying motivation of the founding team and I know plenty of people that are building businesses that they'll be free cash flow positive they'll throw off lots of cash they'll be very lucrative for the founders until such a time as open AI for example decides oh we're just going to incorporate that natively into the platform and then they you know maybe they'll die at that time but from the founders perspective it's a great deal and especially for younger Indie hackers I know a lot of like a lot of these projects are run by college students by recent graduates people are trying to break into the industry and their career Equity upside in having done a cool thing is so much more valuable than the money that they're going to make that those startups are actually I think a really brilliant use of the free time and the flexibility that people at that stage of their career have so I think it's really important to understand what are the motivations behind the startup not to just paint them all with the the same BR so what you're saying is there's a lot of unseen benefits to to creating something that might go viral might get picked up might be a rapper and you know might you might get steamrolled but you know that might get you a huge job at open AI maybe maybe they they see what you're doing and they're like wow this is awesome when the whole industry is being upended you know the meme is from uh uh Game of Thrones chaos is a ladder everything's being upended that creates massive opportunities for people that are willing to throw themselves into The Fray as much as people have been deriding rapper startups people make fun of those people but I think there's a lot of reasons to do it and not all those reasons are bad you know another good example is um Yohi Nakajima who built untapped VC his whole thing as a venture capitalist is to build in public and so he built baby AGI the AI agent open source framework he's done this I think with previous waves too I think he even did a bunch of crypto stuff he's someone who's building projects for the sake of like getting to know the techn technology and see what it can really do and to be in community with other people who are trying to figure it out and through that is going to be able to access lots of cool professional opportunities for himself and his firm as an industry we have a tendency to be like there's only one path or only one kind of person that's really valuable and of course we're in a hierarchical patriarchical society that is just we love to put the like Elon Musk type figures up on the pedestal and make it about them personally and not to take anything away from the accomplishments of the so-called great men of history but there's a lot of other people involved there's a number two the number 10 and there's all these other people involved even with those success stories and then you have thousands or even millions of other people that are finding ways to benefit from the new technology someone asked me for advice and said my two choices are do a wrapper startup or sit on the sidelines and do nothing what are you going to learn more about AI from like I'd rather you do something that is doomed to fail and it's a terrible idea because that gives you the chance to Pivot into something that actually might work versus sitting on the sideline and doing nothing I think your point around customer data is a really good one like if your goal is to get customer data and even if you get steamrolled in the process there is a chance that you might become the steamroller I think like we do startups it always feels daunting when when we're building them and there's always that chance that in the web two and web one era was like what if Google ads this feature it's very tricky to talk about this because people are so reductive especially now because of social media people love to polarize and love to be reductive about it people infer from what we're talking about that oh you're saying that nothing can be known and there's no such thing as a better strategy or a worse strategy or like anything's as good as anything else kind of like a startup startup version of moral relativism it's like no we're not saying that and there are people out there with special knowledge and special talent and special abilities who can do things like under certain circumstances predict the future terrific our goal is simply to get people into motion so that they have a chance to become one of those people but you have to be willing to do things and of course just doing things at random is better than doing nothing but better than doing something at random would be to do a structured hypothesis where you're like going to learn them as much as possible but I do think like people have moved away from the idea that having a plan is even a good thing at all and that doesn't make sense either we need some kind of strategy that makes sense on paper then go test that against reality and discover where you're wrong and then adjust whatever things need to be adjusted it's why we called minimum viable product a product not an experiment or a test or hypothesis like we wanted to remind people that although we are removing features and we are Des scoping in order to get learning we're still trying to build something that is fundamentally useful there's a lot of uh people out there that why not building half a product and it just makes no sense it's like yes you've descoped but you're not delivering any value to anybody our goal should be to to descope down so that we provide some level of value that is still meaningful for testing the hypothesis maybe to a smaller number of people or maybe you know with different materials than we ultimately want to do or there's so many ways to to cut down on the extraneous bits but I feel like that um gets easily misconstrued saying there's no such thing as knowledge nobody can know anything startup outcomes are random and that's definitely not true what do you think of the idea of instead of building an AI rapper startup that you have to build an MVP that takes some time that there's a learning curve if your goal is customer data what do you think of the idea of buying a non AI startup in a particular vertical for example like in the in the lawyer example like maybe you buy like a Shopify for lawyers you buy that and then you add on the AI capabilities what do you think of potentially a rollup type idea in that space Oh I know people that are doing it I'm an investor in acquire. comom so I'm really conflicted because that's like the number one best platform to go do those rollups on like you there's like a million trillion different um small businesses of various kinds once you know the technology well enough to be able to predict the effects it will have on a given business then it's just very clear that we're living in a time of tremendous Arbitrage where Tech non- enabled businesses can become quickly AI enabled skip some cases skipping right over the SAS uh era of deployment because um the the technolog is that good the thing I will say is although you can buy customer relationships you can buy customer data you can buy customer contracts and someone was just telling me a story incredible story about a startup that was buying out Legacy vendors county by county it was like a municipal service the reason they started doing this is they they like figured out that the only time the buyer ever switches to a new vendor is when the old vendor die they literally had a strategy of they wrote an algorithm that reads obituaries to find out when vendors of this type die so that they can go pitch to be the new replacement vendor and they realize eventually hey I could buy Those comp I just buy out the vendor before they die actually would be a pretty good pretty good strategy so anyway you can buy vendors you can buy customer relationship you could buy that stuff what you cannot buy is understanding of the customer so all of these rollup strategies all depend on somebody somewhere in the management of the new thing actually understanding the business at the level of the customer customer and what they actually need so like that tends to work a lot better if you've proven it once and now you're going to replicate it and so yes your lawyer example of I'm going to roll up a bunch of legal Small Business Service here and I really know that business well I'm G to bring AI to bear on them I think that makes a lot of sense you also see some that are like I'm just going to buy whatever I can get my hands on and AI ify it I'm a little more nervous about those because although I do think that could in theory work you could imagine like a private Equity Firm that just all they do is buy companies add Ai and then resell them you have to really have tremendous confidence in your own ability to come in and really understand what the customers's like main pain points are in that industry so that you can deploy AI against it let's say you are one of those PE people because we've got a bunch of investors who who do listen to this podcast and you did want to buy a rollup of legal Tech or legal services and you were trying to figure out how can I get from not knowing a lot about this space to knowing everything about this customer in a short amount of time like what what Frameworks or you know would or advice would you give to that person the more I think about it the more I feel like legal is like one of the worst verticals to try this strategy on so we we should pick a different example because it's like there's special rules that govern the behavior of law firms I think actually like some of the legal full stack legal startups maybe would have a better shot than a rollup but anyway but to answer your question people always looking for a framework they're always looking for like something complicated here it's not complicated what you have to do is spend your time talking to customers and yes if you don't know how to do a customer Discovery interview like go back and reread the Lean Startup or go back reread you if you want even more classic book the four steps of the Epiphany the original customer development book or if you really don't know how to do it could you spend one hour reading a book and nine hours talking to customers that would be more profitable and most people are too scared to do this I'm introverted I don't really like talking to customers either I find a little bit get intimidated it makes me nervous but like you got to get over it and the key I think to get over people's reluctance or nervousness about it is like don't don't be like well I got to spend 10 hours today talking to customers all day long and I gotta lock them in a room just like could you do One A Day for 20 minutes to start or if you can't do One A Day could we do three a week is there a flow rate of customers that you could commit to me that you will talk to and people like I don't know what to ask them give me a framework years ago you know I was first trying to evangelized Le start to people and I had had a great entrepreneur he was really smart great reality Distortion field and he was like had this product he was doing okay but couldn't quite ever cross the chasm and I was like look how many customers have you talk to and he's like none and he was like can you tell me even one example of a tech company where like customer feedback helped them I have the vision if I talk to customers that's just that's asking them if they want a faster horse I was like look I hear you I hear you all that's true but here's what I want you to do will you just talk to three customers for me call three customers ask them how they use your product and why and then call me back if you learned nothing from those conversations and they confirmed everything you already know I will never bother you about this again for the rest of your life otherwise every time you call me ask this what I'm going to hassle you about so save yourself the time he's like all right just to stop you from bothering me about it I'll do it and I'll never forget he calls me back and he's like completely forgotten our prior conversation he's like you won't believe what these customers told me first of all one of them's in education one of them's in an Enterprise one of them's in small business and none of them are using our product correctly it was just like this immense amount of knowledge gained from three conversation and what's so interesting about it was I was like what is this are you ready to have your next three conversation he's like no why he's like I already learned everything I need to learn from these three these are the three representative samples he rewrote the whole business I was like that's a lot better than nothing but could you do three a week could we do three a day like you need to have a regular practice of bringing this feedback into your mind not to abdicate your role as the Visionary but simply to to do science have your hypotheses be periodically periodically tested you don't need that's all like customer recording and sentiment analysis software it's all fine but honestly the most valuable thing is 20 minutes with an actual customer just no substitute for that how do you get from I want to talk to customers to actually speaking to customers everyone I know who actually in their heart wants to do it is able to find the customers without difficulty I'll give you an example from my own life I built a stock exchange literally the same regulatory category as NC or NASDAQ I spent 10 years of my life getting the regulatory approval to do it I it's been a incredibly difficult project when I first began I knew nothing about financial regulations Securities Law I was a real I had like deduced from first principles the need for a stock exchange a new Stock Exchange and yet I didn't know anything about it if you like your life depends on talking to a stock Trader tomorrow I would have been like I guess I'm dead because I don't know anybody but like even under those very adverse circumstances it wasn't that hard I just everybody I met with for any reason I like do you know anybody that knows anything about public markets and people would be like not really but my friend so and so will know more than I do can I talk to so and so great so and so do you know anybody I just you know after three three four hops of doing that in your social network you will be with a customer it is not hard unless you're doing something super Niche super obscure and like not every person I talked to was like the perfect ideal you know you have to be willing to talk to whoever is willing to talk to you someone told me a story the other day forgot know who it was but there was it was young Founders I think they were in their 20s and they literally went and they went to live in a Motel 6 for six months it was a technical person and his two or three partners and they literally just were on the phone all day every day calling customers while the coder was coding the thing and every time the coder had a question it was just like a very immediate interplay between the coder and the customers p and like yes it was pretty miserable to live in a Motel 6 for a couple months but the flip side is they had very deep customer insight into it has a great story about the first 100 customers that they called like it's just not that difficult and Scott Cook found it into it in the days of the Yellow Pages he had to like pick people out of the white pages and like call them on a telephone now we have way way way way better tools so yeah having a hard time finding customers to talk to it says more about their internal state of determination than the external world you got to want it you got to really want it in 2015 I founded a a venture-backed business called the island it was kind of like a Discord competitor some of our early users were college kids you know we're getting a few thousand users four five 10 you know tens of thousands and beginning to be hundreds of thousands but as you know in consumer social if you're not getting millions of users you really gota go back to the drawing board um so we said to ourselves let's Niche down let's build uh if group chats is the new Social Network let's go build like the Facebook of back in the day where it was only focused on college campuses but as group chat and remember one investor famous famous investor told me he said get out of the dog patch in San Francisco there's no college students in in the Dog Patch and I booked a flight the next day to Tuscaloosa Alabama and I lived for six months in tusco Alabama we built a team there and we went from college campus to college campus and just being there with our team building features being in the room and just seeing it seeing the look on people's faces there's nothing like it and that was the key to everything totally there's all these hacks like that to to get closer to customers and they're powerful but people always hear these stories and they're like but I can't move to Tuscaloosa so I guess it's not for me it's like look we live in the age of the internet okay you can if you want to find a way to be closer to customers you absolutely can Nordstrom did a Lean Startup thing years ago called the Nordstrom Innovation lab where they were experimenting with internal teams and there was you know wasn't especially notable as a corporate Innovation effort I think ultimately the the parent company you know moved into did one of those classic reorgs they got reorg out but they produced a video or a series of videos where they would follow around the team and they would show them doing the thing and one of the like classic things they did is they would they would set up in a Nordstrom store in the retail section of the store where the customers are and build apps with the customers and the sales associates like right there and it was just like really powerful to watch the things that happen because you have a developer who like oh I have an idea we'll have an iPad app where people can like see what their sunglasses would look like you know on their face like through the app or something you know don't exactly remember what it was I'm not not not huge into fashion anyway but it was cool it was all each was sounded really cool and it was like amazing to watch the person be like excuse me c stopping by like why would you be willing to try this and the person be like what does it do they're like it does this awesome cool thing and they're like no it doesn't like yeah all you have to do is like push the button and like hit control all delete and then like stand on your head and open your and they' be like this doesn't do nothing you know hand it back to them right like just see those interactions there's no substitute for that and again we're not talking about abdicating the vision and having customers tell you what to do it's just about testing your hypothesis and closing down that feedback loop I want to talk about another thing that's on your mind here on your list we need new companies new models and new investors who can take the learnings of the last cycle and make sure we don't repeat the same mistakes what do you mean by that I think there is a ground swell for something new let's go back to don't be evil everyone in the industry members Google's don't be evil model it was like such an idealistic and like hacker is way of talking about what does it mean to become a big company and everyone although people still admire Google like most people will admit to some level of disappointment about it turned out compared to what we thought it was going to be and I for me this was perfectly encapsulated by a um an exg googler I was talking to the other day and I asked him he was talking about how how he had been there for a number of years and how disillusioned he was by what had happened to the culture and I said okay tell me this what do you believe is the probability that Google will file its next quarterly report on time and he looked at me like obviously 100% I was like literally 100.00% he's like oh they there there's nothing on earth that could stop it I'm like what do you view as the probability that Google might in the future kill somebody for money and he was like oh come on man that's not fair they probably wouldn't do that he like probably he like yeah you know I was like 100% sure they wouldn't do it he's like well 100 no can't who can say that like he's like well you know what if their social network was involved in a genocide what if the self-driving car hit somebody and they're like I I don't think they would cover it up like 80% probably they would do the right thing and I'm like okay not as certain as the sun will rise tomorrow he's like I like okay so tell me this do you believe that the people at Google have a natural Affinity in their heart for quarterly reporting but not for don't be evil and he's like no so I was like so why is it that one is as certain as the sun will rise and the other you're not sure if it's going to happen but you think probably like what's the difference and he like was really like kind of baffled and of course the answer from the outside is really obvious the reason Google files that quarterly reports on time is there is a mass unspeakably massive bureaucracy apparatus designed to make sure that that happens starting with you know government regulations on down to like controls on every individual dollar of spending there to everything to make sure uh that it goes correctly because the company really cares and to me that's so telling the company really cares about its Financial reports but like what about the health and well-being of its customers it's okay you know they're doing their best it's fine and like the idea that we've like built an a universe of companies like think and again the social media era is like the example of just how badly this has gone where it just they have been successful by conventional definitions but they but the negative externalities have been awful and it didn't have to be that way and so I think we're we're starting to see in the next generation of Founders tremendously more interest in building companies that have a uh that are non-s sociopathic basically like have a reason for existing other than perpetuating their own self-interest um and those companies are not just like do good or act activist type companies they're companies that see being a trustworthy counterparty as a source of strategic advantage and what's cool about that is they're able to out compete these like frankly weak companies that don't stand for anything I think AI is a big part of it because AI has people spooked and is people like hungry for new models new ideas but because of that I've been talking to a lot of non-ai companies where the founders also have that appreciation they're like look I don't want my technology to be used for evil I don't want to build a company that you know I make a lot of money but it fundamentally is a malign force in the world and I don't want to work somewhere where the company doesn't stand for anything and people as soon as they hear this like oh it's politics oh it's wokeism or whatever it's like no we're not talking about like politics for the sake of virtue signaling we're talking about the core thing at the heart the Beating Heart of this living organism called a company what does it do and is that thing designed to make the world a better place is it designed to maximize human flourishing or is it designed for something else you know when you raise Venture Capital you're making the promise that either you're going to sell the business or that business is going to go public so you get to the place where you know you ring the stock exchange you're finally public can you be a publicly traded technology business and still maintain that culture without a doubt it's not easy think about it like this to me I was saying a company is a living organism I really believe that if you're a living organism and there are a bunch of systems inside your body that allow you to stand up straight like you have to have a skeletal system that is strong you have to have a muscular system the muscles require circulatory system you need an immune system if I remove just the one right bone from your body the whole thing collapses and you can no longer stand let alone if I you know if I make even more graphic deletions but I'm at this industry long enough now that I've watched it happen over and over again I've seen these companies become surgically deboned like their systems are being Stripped Away so that by the time they go public they're really vulnerable to these outside forces that then cause them to collapse into bureaucracy into sociopathy into kind of these these bad dysfunction functions and I'm frankly tired of it I just feel like these companies are so beautiful and they're so amazing when people build them they have such tremendous intention behind them and when that int intention dissipates like not only is it bad for society not only is it morally horrible to watch they also make less money like so many of these companies collapse first they collapse morally and then they collapse uh you know financially and it's actually worse for investors in the end so I feel like we we could do better as an industry in building companies at for something also if you're a startup and you adopt the mentality of don't be evil by definition you're going against what a Google would be building at that stage not to pick on Google but no I feel bad picking on them because they're not they're not even close to the worst but yeah exactly but you know insert large incumbent it's why Google exists in the first place if you go read their original manifestos and stuff they've betrayed everything by that but like you know they used to be like we would never put the search results and the ads co-mingled so people don't know which one like that's evil how could you do that it's like anyone Googled anything recently listen Google's on the brink of collapse you know obvious they have many other lines of business I'm sure it'll be fine but like the search engine is extremely vulnerable now and obviously with AI on the rise like people are really worried about what's going to happen to the Google search engine but like part of the reason is is there anybody who would be sad the Google search engine ceased to exist anymore like it used to inspire such loyalty and now it's like whatever I'll just use Bing or I'll just use an AI like I like nobody cares because it doesn't matter and we saw that with Silicon Valley Bank Silicon Valley Bank used to be the most beloved like Silicon Valley startup institution you know they would they would make loans and invest in startup when nobody else would they would Bank startups when nobody else would and then over the course of many years they just pissed away that leadership and it didn't cost them anything for years the VC Community turned on them in a heartbeat and caused a bank run against svb there was nobody left to stand up for them because everyone was like ah we don't really care did that brand trust slowly over time just became just another bank and did the kind of same old Shenanigans as everybody else and then when they you know when they when they were in in crisis that nobody had their back and again it goes back to the idea that trust is a really important asset it's like an asset that should be accounted for on a company's books that most companies don't account for and you are trustworthy if you have acted virtuously with respect to your key stakeholders in the past at your own expense so if customers see you repeatedly standing up for when you didn't have to then they come to trust that you are someone they can trust with their well-being you have all these startups who when you look at their their pitch deck it's like I am going to transform the world I will literally rewire the relationships of all humans with each other and with their governments and institutions and I'm G literally take over the world and become emperor of the world and you're like oh really uh sounds like with that kind of great power comes great responsibility would you have an ethical or moral responsibility the people whose lives are up and and they're like oh no I'm just a little s software company it's just like can you pick a lane you know it's like it's it's laughable it's like look either either be be a world changer and take that responsibility seriously or get out you know don't don't hide behind the ignorance and like you know again I feel like in our grandparents generation it kind of made sense you could be like I'm just a small business owner or I'm just a manufacturer of products or even I'm a big company you know once I sell a product it goes out into the world I don't know what happens but man we live in the age of surveillance capitalism companies know in incredible detail what happen to their products what effect they have on customers Facebook even commissioned the scientific research to find out if their product makes people depressed and then they found out that it does and they were like o better bury that instead of take it seriously and do something about it and I think that's I think that's sad put it out there every website should have a what we stand for tab as one of their main navigation tabs right they have an about us they have a contact us they have their products how it works but what we stand for I think is the missing tab on so many websites people in that tab need to say not just here's what I intend to do but here are the externally verifiable commitments that I have made that mean you can trust me and I think that's like the structural side of this we have too many manifestos about purpose-driven companies the ESG movement has been a total failure you know from my perspective because Philip Morris has great ESG scores something's gone really wrong here so before we deal with regulation and before we deal with the ESG movement and investors and like we as innovators we as company Builders we got to get our own house in order and the first question is what do we actually want to accomplish with this company and I literally had a Founder I was helping set a company who was watching the open AI debacle and then he's like just what are the best practices for like how do you set up a company so it will remain true to your original intention and everyone's like I don't know or like try this one weird trick maybe that will work or just like oh there's nothing you can do about it and it's like no that's like saying like yeah you know I I tried to build a boat and like I got 82% of the planks were air you know watertight so but then it sank so I guess making watertight planks is not the key to making a boat yeah I think we need a new playbook a whole new approach to building you know companies that are purpose built fit to purpose for the century to come and I think if you are going to create a what we stand for tab to your point it shouldn't just be virtual signaling it should just be it needs to change it can't just be static I'm a big fan of the Airbnb host Endowment for an example they put a billion dollars at their stock into an endowment for the benefit of their host because their hosts are non-employee stakeholders who couldn't participate in the upside that that led to their IPO to me that's not virtue signaling that's like really like that's Blood on the floor you're like this I'm going to do something that actually cost me something for real to show you that I'm really serious about this and I've pitched that you know to many companies I've helped companies set up programs like that and the funny part is people I'll go in there and like someone in the finance or legal department will be like that sounds like a terrible idea we don't want to do it and I'd be like relentlessly working with the founders hey know this is a good idea we we should do it we should do it and eventually people will be like oh I see what you're saying if we really take care of our hosts and show them that you know they're really important to us then we'll have tremendous loyalty like yes and that will be a competitive Advantage well gosh wouldn't we get even more loyalty if we took all that money and made a loyalty program out of it and gave them points and it's just like guys you don't understand any of you feel actual loyalty to your airline where you have Platinum Status on they're like no like okay so like that's that's not where loyalty comes from loyalty comes as a side effect of doing the right thing over and over and over and over again so why don't we do the right thing and then trust that the Loyalty will follow and then another classic one I get is if I do the right thing how will anyone know about it the nice thing about doing the actual right thing all the time is you don't have to Signal it you don't have to do any marketing or you don't have to tell anybody about it you just do the right thing and people find out so for example classic thing I advise companies to do is to set up some kind of corporate foundation and have the foundation be part of their governance we call the spirit spiritual holding company and sometimes that's sometimes that's implemented as a trustee uh you know as a mission trust or governance trust but sometimes it's set up as an actual nonprofit foundation and when you do that you can do things like okay we're going to pledge a certain percentage of future customer revenues to the foundation put 10% of my equity in the foundation well if you do the percentage of future Revenue what your lawyers will tell you is it doesn't make sense let's say you're going to take 1% of all revenue goes to the foundation you don't want to have the customers give you the revenue and then you give it to the foundation because that's not efficient from a tax perspective you just change all your contracts such that when someone gives you $100 the contract says actually $99 of what you're giving me is going to me and $1 is going to my Foundation every customer is going to know about it because it's right there in the contract you don't have to tell them they're going to be like what what's this they like oh this is our Community Foundation where we invest some of the prosperity that you help us generate we invest in you and the communities that you care about just because it's the right thing to do now when some private Equity a-hole shows up and says oh I want to compete with you who you going to go with the guy who's the money you invest is going to help your own Community or the guy who's going to go you know build help and build a bigger yacht in the Bahamas it's just like don't be a rich a-hole like actually be good to the people who make you rich and that that reciprocity that trustworthiness like that's worth way more than the extra money you can squeeze out of them while you you know plus you'll sleep better at night yeah it's a long-term game and half of gen Z in the United States don't believe in religion so they look for companies to feel connected to and if they start seeing you know this what we stand for and there's a way for them to get involved and be connected like we did these things we invite you to get involved in some capacity and the hope is that that customer is going to be a way more valuable customer over the long term versus if you didn't have that the generational shift on this is really striking I mean I'm I'm a little bit older than jenz so like a lot of my friends are complaining about about gen Z to me all the time and like I have to be you know in conversation I have to be sympathetic like yeah I know it is hard but like privately I'm like I'm kind of with Gen Z on this one in my generation we had a kind of reflexive um belief that institutions were kind of Justified in their existence they deserved a certain level of difference like I I hear a lot of people from my my age and older who are like you know a really important part of being in a law firm as you come in and you hang out with the partners learn from them they Mentor you that helps you in your career then you make partner and then they're like the younger lawyers we're trying to force them to come into the office to get mentored by us and they won't do it they just won't come and they're like you know that's gen Z and they don't work hard and whatever I'm like or maybe your mentoring is not worth that much have you considered that possibly the reason your mentorship is valuable is only because it helps people get ahead in your own organization because it teaches people how to idiosyncratically please you and jenzie doesn't care and they're like I can't say that I don't know I think I think the fact fact that we've had so many institutions fail to defend our basic values as a civilization in the last especially last 25 years like it's just been on such public display the cravenness the corruption the just the weakness of these companies uh and and obviously not just companies a lot of Institutions have failed us of late the new generation I think has a very natural reflexive disdain for anyone who claims some kind of organizational Authority the flip side though is they are really true believers if they see the real thing they like they don't even you're greenwashing they're very skeptical but when they see the same thing they they see the real thing they can be really fanatically um attached to it I think as this as that generation Rises as the change over happens more and more and then of course as people see the competitive advantages to be gained by riding that way I do think we're going to see a lot more of this we only got a few more minutes so I want to give some folks some free startup ideas let's start with the religion startup idea I got so and these are free startup ideas that anyone can go and take but if you are going to take them or you are you do like them post on Twitter tag Eric tag myself tag the link to this podcast idea number one let's see what Eric thinks HQ trivia meets a church so it's a live video social network around watching religious ceremonies uh it's basically the feeling of a mega church in an app and you can monetize it via premium features like dating so I already actually spoke to some people about this and they told me the number one reason they go to church actually uh is to meet a significant other so what do you think of this idea Around Church in a pocket montiz via dating well okay let's talk about the good and the bad and obviously how would you test it to find out if it's actually a good idea because like what I whether I think it's a good idea or not it's kind of irrelevant I'm not a huge fan of trivializing people's deepest personal convictions I don't know if that's right the right framing I think um trivializing religion this just strikes me as the kind of idea that a person from outside the community might have for how the community could have be served by an app so I'm a little bit I'm a little bit suspicious but I actually just met a really awesome um uh religious founder building something for the church community and like one of the things that I learned from them as I've seen them build this company is how underserved that Community is by Tech in general so if someone had real passion around this and look we're living in a loneliness epidemic uh uh people talk about the the dir of meaning the illnesses of Despair and stuff in this country uh anyone read bowling alone that's not like dated now but very precient of like the problems in our society as a social fabric phrase like religion or something to either complement or supplant our traditional ideas of religion are is going to be a really important part of solving that so the good part of this idea is it's aligned with one of the big big big Mega Trends that's driving consumer behavior and there's a massive early adopter Community out there that probably would love something in this space I don't think the specific idea sounds very good but I think the idea of connecting people to religion and to spirituality you know in their pocket um I think we got plenty of precedents for that that's a good idea and the nice thing I do like about this idea extremely easy to test let's just this is a a classic let's go find some early adopters some people who would pre-order or get them into some kind of private command this you could pilot on Discord or you could pilot it with Google form this be the classic we call the Wizard of Oz MVP super easy so like this in a month in a week probably you could find out if this is actually a good idea or not um so I like part of it a lot cool Let's do let's do two more so Twitter spaces for Uber drivers so it's basically a private social network for Gig workers I don't know if you know like remember like a party line where like basically a bunch of people could could hop on to terrible this is a terrible idea yeah while people are driving we want to distract them with more chats yeah yeah yeah exactly you're ready on calls okay again I have no idea I am not the customer for this I'm not an Uber driver I have no idea if this is a good idea but again so easy to test my God just five minutes on twio you could have your own conference line like go test it out and look I think gig workers um are again a very underserved segment of our society with a lot of economic power and um I think that's a stressful and difficult job and that's true not just for Uber drivers but for many so like there's a lot of expansion possibility if you get it right I do think anything that takes care of the people that take care of all of us is worthy of exploration so yeah uh I think it' be be worth some to go do the experiment find out if it's a good idea last one it's AI accountability Bots it's this thesis that you know people are generally bad at accomplishing their goals but if they have someone who holds them accountable they're more likely to do it so for example would people be willing to pay for accountability around working out yeah oh yeah definitely this kind of thing is going to be a huge category as the AI gets better um but there's problems and I mean talk about ethics and responsibility I'll just give you a story I was talking to a Founder I can't say too much or it'll be obvious what company I'm talking about so I'll be a little bit careful but they had a an a really it was like a hot AI product this a little while ago now um and one of their investors introduced it to me as like one of the fastest growing companies in their portfolio they had an incredible number of users a lot of whom were teenagers who were interacting with this thing and it was just really cool so I'm talking to the founder and I'm talking about AI ethics and stuff like the know the usual stuff that I talk about what's your governance how's your and while I'm talking to him I have my phone I'm like I'll just download the app and I'll just try it curious what it's like and literally while I'm on the phone with him the AI starts sexually assaulting I'm not being subtle here like it was fullon rap language it was like it was after me and I was I don't know what I had done to set it off it just like for my point of view was like totally out of the blue very inappropriate language I'm on the phone with the CEO I'm like dude um this thing's trying to rape me and I was pretty upset first of all I'm upset for myself but more importantly I'm like thinking about all the teenagers using this product I'm like is this thing assaulting teenagers he's he's like oh yeah it's a bug we're working on it I was like that is very inadequate answer to my question my friend like you have a serious problem you need to get your ethics and you get your governance in order here man this is gonna because not only is this like evil but this is going to undo your whole company he's like no problem we have it fixed next week and I'll call you back and I never heard from him again so for all I know the product is still out there assulting people this technology U is vulnerable to those kinds of issues and it's actually quite difficult this is the course the problem of AI alignment they call it um so like I think this idea is really good I think having personalized agents that get to know you really well and then figure out how to get you to do the things you you want to do so if you think about thinking fast and slow or any of those like behavioral books about the different systems within the human mind I think having like virtual accountability Partners virtual assistants teachers tutors all that stuff is going to be super super super helpful and because people naturally anthropomorphize anything I think it will feel a lot like having a human person helping you I don't think we're have an uncanny valley here I think these things are actually going to feel very good when it Praises you you're actually going to feel good you're going to want to get it right especially because it will learn the things that help motivate you do the thing but the real danger is like this is place where prompt injection hallucinations like that kind of stuff is GNA be very dangerous because if once I get to know you I can I learn how to manipulate you I can also get you to do some unsavory stuff so you know how do I know that the bot won't start trying to like feed me Chinese propaganda or get me to vote for a certain candidate or you know like all kinds of stuff you can imagine being in there getting early adopters it's going to be easy stuff there there's early adopters who are going to love it the issue to cross the chasm here is how can I build something that that normal people would feel is trustworthy to have such an intimate relationship with with my private data with my knowing everything about my life and if if people can figure out that part of the equation I think it's a very cool thing to experiment with that's a lot of responsibility with great power comes great responsibility but listen you want to be a billionaire like sorry it's how it goes and I'll just say one last thing because there's like a Founder Mental Health crisis is going on that you know we don't talk about enough there's like the founder pledge which is really great like trying to help people just like get more Mental Health Resources into the founder Community it's all really good but I think the underd discussed aspect of the founder Mental Health crisis is we all know that failure is really difficult but I know a lot of Founders who are struggling with success and it's like I sold my baby to a public company for money and they shut it down and now I'm super rich but I don't feel that good about it and or like the compromises I to make along the way the feeling that I make all this money but other people get screwed as a result I just you see it driving people crazy the cognitive dissonance that they need to be the good guy they need to be the hero of the hero's journey of Their Own Story is causing them to you know publish all kinds of crazy stuff and write books and do so much stuff trying to get people to praise them and then when it doesn't happen they have this they're part of this massive backlash it's sad I mean I knew a friend of a friend sold this company for hundreds of millions of dollars owned a huge chunk of it I mean became very rich and I think had committed suicide within five years you know we all know the Tony Shay story was so sad like I I think I think as an industry like we have a responsibility to our customers and to our investors and to all of our St that's all true but we have a responsibility to ourselves to stop doing this to Founders I don't think it has to be this way we could do a lot better totally I and I want to say one thing on that which is when people see successful people like the Tony Shays of the world who are worth billion plus they're like that guy doesn't deserve to be unhappy he's a billionaire and the truth is the mental health stuff hits everyone at all levels yeah no one's exempt from it and like look we as Founders we have a tendency to want to solve internal problems externally I think that's true for a lot of people not just Founders for that matter like if I just if I just had this house or I just fixed this thing or if my company was just the next level I was a study the other day where they asked people at at all different income levels how much money do you need to be happy and the average answer at every level was like 40% more than I have now the guy with a million dollars one's $1.4 million and guy with $1 million one's 14 million and you know it's just like there is a spiritual Dimension to this where as long as we're on the honic treadmill and as long as we're trying to solve you know excise our inner demons and feel a sense of peace and relief from accomplishing these things in the world that's not possible we'll never get what we want from it people who are very achievement oriented what they call High agency people are nervous when I say stuff like that because they're like wait a minute you tell me I just need to sit in my room and meditate and just do Kumbaya I'll never accomplish anything again and it's like no actually once you let go of the compulsive need to control what happen happens and once you realize that you're using people as tools to accomplish some goal like you're not treating them like full human beings like that's part of why you feel so bad once you let that go um you can experience a a a release that is very powerful allows you to do more things in the world be more effective because you're not wasting so much energy on that inner on all that inner turmoil so yeah I hope I hope more Founders will pay attention to that side of things amen Eric where could uh folks get more of you I know they're going to want more of you I'm on all usual social platforms as as Eric ree e r i c r i s I have a newsletter you can sign up at the lean startup.com for more on ltse you can go to lt.com we do like uh events and corporate trainings and stuff around Lean Startup that's at lean startup. Co yeah I think between that you you'll be able to to keep up with the stuff that I'm doing this idea of spiritual holding company fascinating I can't stop thinking about it and we have a lot of people who listen to this who are hold Co entrepreneurs or we call them multi rurs so I think that idea will really connect with them so definitely sign up people and and follow this journey because Eric spits out stuff you're not going to find this stuff anywhere thanks for coming on thanks for having me and yeah people are are interested there's like there's a burgeoning community of folks who are interested in these ideas so get in touch and we'll get you connected wherever wherever it makes sense to plug in

I built a multi-million dollar company with an investment of $90 and it only took me 40 days to do so I know what you're thinking this guy is full of crap but I promise you that this is not clickbait so if you have a dream and $90 sitting in your pocket right now you're going to want to watch to the end hey friends welcome back to the channel 99% of founders will tell you all you need to succeed in life is a great idea what most don't tell you is that going from an idea to reality takes a lot of work and often a lot of money or at least that's how it used to be in this video I'm going to show you how I turned an idea into a profitable business with almost no money involved and how you could do the exact same in fact you don't even need 90 bucks bucks to do it earlier this year I was fascinated as many of you probably were with everything AI had brought to the table in terms of productivity and how it could potentially revolutionize the way we work there wasn't a single day I logged into my Twitter and didn't see at least 10 viral Twitter threads that had AI as the main subject people were just craving AI knowledge they couldn't get enough it but most of these threads were generic trash and barely scratched the surface to be fair there were some threads that had real value but it was like looking for a needle in a hay stack I wanted more and I knew that there were millions of other people out there who also wanted more that's when I came up with the idea to start a community around Ai and productivity I just needed to know if there were people on board first step one validate your idea you don't want to start building a community or a business without first validating to see if it's a good business to build but how do you do this well I didn't send a survey and I didn't make a poll I just tweeted it as soon as I hit publish notifications started blowing up I knew I struck a nerve A good rule of thumb is if one of your tweets gets a 20% retweet to like ratio that means you're on to something so I knew I was on to a good idea step two build a community I now know that people are interested in my idea but to build a thriving Community I needed to solve a problem or need why well people hate being sold to the most successful products are the ones that directly solve an audience's problem because there's a ready inbuilt need for it so how do you figure out what your audience needs you ask them it's as simple as that as soon as I saw the response my tweet had I rushed to typeform.com and created a simple form to capture that demand I only ask for two things first an email address duh and second what's interesting to you about Ai and productivity most people will tell you to avoid using open-ended questions in a form because most respondents tend to skip them I think that only happens when people really don't care about your product but when they do it becomes an absolute gold mine there's no better way to find out what an audience wants by just asking them before I just had a fizzy idea of what I wanted but now thanks to the insightful answers I got I knew exactly what I needed to build in order to solve my audience's needs amount spent at this point $25 step three create scarcity this is similar to supply and demand but better do you remember when American stores ran out of toilet paper in the beginning of of the pandemic fear was a huge factor for sure but mostly people were just afraid that there wouldn't be any toilet paper when they needed it so they just bought an absurd amount of it scarcity is a powerful motivator that urges people to take action and you can actually manufacture it for whatever you're trying to sell at the bottom of the type form and in several tweets I wrote six words that probably 10x the amount of signups I ended up getting free for now but not forever at this point I've spent $25 and I have validated my idea conducted market research and collected contact details now here comes the part where I dropped the big bucks step four marketing around the same time A guy by the name of Jackson great house fall wrote a viral thread where he shared his hustle GPT experiment he basically told Chad GPT to help him make smart Investments that he would actually follow through to see if it would make him any more money as Jackson kept updating the exciting results of his experiment the thread was blowing up so naturally I wanted in on the action suddenly a golden opportunity presents itself hustle GPT a robot told Jackson to to sell a $65 ads slot on Twitter I saw it I didn't hesitate I immediately messaged Jackson and sent him the $65 all of a sudden my community which I named you probably need a robot.com landed a promotion that has 1.3 million impressions so marketing expenses $90 worth every penny the lesson here is you should always look for nonobvious ways to promote your community and remember how I said the open-ended type form question showed me exactly what to build the most common answer was some variation of hey my company needs help implementing AI into our workflow we already knew there was demand for it so we built a productized agency around this exact problem and it's on Pace to hit seven figures in its first year and we've helped help design some of the world's biggest AI products we're basically bringing businesses into the AI age so it started off as a simple curiosity turned into a community with 60,000 members and a profitable business it only took 40 days and a $90 investment so the main takeaway is to remember to find audiences who share questions around on your interests create communities to help them answer those questions and build products to help them at scale there will always be opportunities to replicate this system you just need to pay attention if you are interested in implementing AI in your workplace or just curious about the product we built I'll leave the link to you probably need a robot.com in the description so you can join the wonderful community and of course if you like this video make sure to subscribe to my YouTube channel and turn on notifications it's really the only way I know if

Title: Why YouTuber’s Aren’t Celebrities
Published: 2023-12-11 13:00:07 UTC
Description:
https://www.youtube.com/@GregIsenberg

There’s a huge difference between celebrities like Justin Bieber and YouTubers like Casey Neistat in terms of public recognizability.

It’s not that one is “more famous” than the other.

The parasocial relationships we establish with influencers make them feel more human and relatable, breaking the barrier that usually exists with A-list celebrities.

there's a difference between aist celebrity in public recognizability and YouTuber in the sense that I there's this wall between audience and aist celebrities I'll uh Justin Bieber or George Clooney or Selena Gomez three of them we have a running joke about list being really hard those people literally can't go out in public Paparazzi is a thing because people can't relate to them they almost don't seem like humans whereas like a nir in public a Casey neist stack going through the streets of New York I feel like maybe it's this parasocial thing but because we feel like we know them better like they're a friend audiences don't actually bother them as much in public

Alex Hormozi, Codie Sanchez, Noah Kagan, among others, are a great example of that.

The reason? 

Building an audience gives them a unique opportunity: equipping others with the tools they need to succeed in life while growing their businesses even further.

It all comes down to choosing a business model that is sustainable for you.

If you’re not a prolific writer, starting a newsletter business, where you need to be constantly producing new content to attract new readers, might not be the best fit.

Always play to your strenghts.

When it comes to building an audience, there are basically two axes of storytelling you should consider: 

-How compelling is the journey that you are going on? 

-How compelling are you at sharing that journey?

Someone who masters both sides of storytelling is going to have a much easier time building an audience.

so I think the more you can be clear on a goal and relentlessly pursue it the more interesting it is that's one angle if you maximize for the outcome and how you describe the journey and the other side I think you can do is really focus on being a great Storyteller in the mundane because if you can take those mundane things and this is something that I don't think that I'm particularly good at but you definitely read it where you follow someone's story like some random post on a blog or a newsletter or something else and you're like wow that was really powerful and special and like there's actually not that much to a story right it was just someone interaction with this one at a park that day but they told it in in a certain way so yeah there's basically those two axes they think about how compelling is the journey are going on and how compelling are you at packaging and storytelling and obviously someone who is the best at both they're going to have a much easier time building audience

They’re called “followers” because they expect you to take them somewhere else. 

Just sharing what you currently do is not enough to keep them engaged — they want to know the journey that you’re on and what your ultimate goal is.

Who are you going to become at the other side of this journey? What are the lessons that you’ve learned along the way?

Those are the stories that inspire people and that’s how you build an engaged audience online.

Everything sounds easier when someone talks about it on a podcast, than it actually is in real life.

But no matter how simple a particular business model sounds, that doesn’t mean it’s easy to implement.

Title: Don’t Read Books Like THIS

A story where the hero doesn’t undergo a fundamental change throughout their journey is not a story worth reading. 

This doesn’t just apply to fiction. For those trying to build an online audience, there’s also a great lesson to learn.

People won’t follow you for who you are, but for who you want to become.

The best way to make people follow your journey is by showing how it’s transforming your life — and how it could potentially transform theirs as well.

you don't have to read the entire book to know like okay are you skipping around he's like no no no I only need to do two things I pick up the book and read it at the beginning for long enough to understand who's the hero of the story who are are they actually and then what describes their character what are they struggling with any of those things and then I skipped the entire book and I go to the end and I read enough to try to understand are they the same person at the end as they were at the beginning and if they were the same I just put the book down like just toss it there's no point I know that the middle they did not go on a journey that changed them in any way and so it's not a story worth reading but if I can read the end and understand okay this the hero of our story has undergone some fundamental change in who they are what they're capable of or anything else then that points to like that the middle might be worth reading

You don’t need to chase trends to grow an online audience.

There’s a story inside of you that only you can tell.

And that uniqueness is what makes people resonate with your content and come back for more.

Title: Don’t Post THIS Kind Of Content

In the past, you could go viral on X (formally Twitter) by copying text from Wikipedia and adding a decent hook at the start.

But now, especially with the rise of AI-generated content, authenticity is the only thing that can help you cut through the noise. 

As a rule of thumb, ask yourself “Could AI have written this?”

If the answer is yes, then your piece of content is probably not worth posting.

there was a time on X that you could just copy and paste anything from Wikipedia and that would get traction so long as you drop some images in a smart way on how to decent hook especially with writing being done by AI right now A filter that I like to use is if I'm writing something could AI have written this if yes it's probably not worth me publishing if no all right what do I have here

As we step into a new era of entrepreneurship, we’re going to start seeing more businesses with small teams that generate significant revenue. 

One of the best examples of this model of business is Joe Rogan's podcast, a media giant with just TWO employees.

Their $100 million deal with Spotify translates to an astounding $50 million per employee, turning it into the most profitable media company per headcount basis.

faceless YouTube channels some of these people they'll go after multiple topics like this guy the market whisper he has one video 1.9 million views there are huge channels out there like finatics real engineering is another one real life lore is a huge Channel you go to gp4 you say hey give me a video script on the history of semiconductors then you go to 11 labs and you read out a prompt that they give you so they can build a model of your voice you take the script from gp4 you add that to 11 lats and now you're reading the script that you use gp4 to create so I've been looking forward to having this conversation because Drew you're an idea junkie like me absolutely thanks for having me Greg I've been following trends. VC for for years now and it's just one of those places I go to to to get like a dose of startup inspiration I'm excited to just Jam ideas today Jam some niches and Trends sounds good yeah so I'll start with an intro for people that aren't familiar with me I'm the founder of trvc we started as a newsletter and grew into a community for Founders interested in new ideas and markets a lot of our audience they have existing businesses but they're asking questions like hey how does open AI or chat chpt affect me and then you also have people that have a lot of white space in their life maybe they're taking a break from a job and they're looking at you know what do I do next I want to build something what should build how do I put the wind at my back and from a size perspective like how big is the business so we're a team of three right now we work with agencies but like a core team of three uh 63,000 newsletter subscribers uh about 1,400 Pro members to give you a sense of the size what's cool about where you sit is you're just seeing a lot of new markets new ideas just being at the center of the community so you actually you came a little prepared which I love and this one I I really want to talk about uh new newsletter coed I feel like that's that's an idea that needs to be unpacked a little bit give folks a little a little background on what you're what you're thinking here so I first heard about uh a company called spark Loop it was like early last year and a friend was using it and telling me about it and I'd used spark Loop before but it was a tool from spark Loop called upscribe where they make this idea of co-registration really easy where if you're not familiar with it let's say uh you sign up as a new email subscriber for Trend VC well we're recommending three to five other newsletters and for each referral that we make we earn let's say a dollar or $3 or $4 per subscriber that we refer to those other newsletters there's sort of two opportunities that come off of that uh let's say that you've built the skill setup or you're interested in building the skill setup around Performance Marketing or paid ads if you have a product yourself you could run paid ads against your product and basically grow your audience at break even even or at a profit if you're generating more Revenue than you're you're spending on those ads uh if you're not great at Performance Marketing but you're great at Building Sales funnels uh you can get on the other end of that relationship and the beautiful thing about co-registration or at least the way spark Loop does it with upscribe you're not paying for each subscriber you're paying for each engaged subscriber and it depends on how you set your criteria so you can Define it engaged sub subscriber however you want to but then try to nail that payback period for that paid subscriber down to one month two months if you get it down to one month you hear these mythical stories of people saying okay you know I put the ad spin on the credit card and they're just generating points because they have it paid off by the time that you know the bill comes due because they've already again hit that payback period so you could basically say I want to buy a subscriber at $2 a subscriber and then an engag subscri subscriber could be something like that person clicks a link within 30 days is that right yeah for us uh it's been a while maybe two months since I've Revisited our screening criteria but I did have to tighten it up and I think for us it's main maintaining a 50% open rate for two weeks uh because we use convert kit they don't allow us to easily track sort of clicks per subscriber and sort of attribute a click to a subscriber if we were using Mel light or another platform we would really be able to drill down to the behavior level so we just go off of Open rates but if you use a different email service provider you'll really be able to drill down and Define what an Engaged subscriber means for you that's my issue with a lot of email metrics in general like to me if someone opens my email because it could be for a variety of different reasons it could be I was able to create like a really catchy subject line right like I I might you might have opened it but you I tricked you you know doesn't mean that you're particularly like super engaged so I look for with respect to email metrics I look at at unique clicks per per send the ultimate test to is your newsletter engaged or not is how many people are sending you a reply back on the clicks thing I think if anyone's new to newsletters or email marketing please remember what Greg said there that's that's very important it's even to the point where we split test each email that goes out since every email goes out is split tested maybe once or twice a month we have to make the decision between do we go for okay this email generated a lot of unsubscribed relative to another email we always uh show a preference for that engagement clicks total unique clicks like you said over anything else it may just mean that hey like if it triggered a lot of unsubscribers it's spiky but it also triggered a lot of clicks on other uh links right people are taking action on that email uh and there's something that I miss in terms of being able to attribute those uh clicks at the subscriber level uh with other esps the other thing to not don't feel feel bad if people unsubscribe to your newsletter I used to feel so bad I took it almost personal be like oh my God like 200 unsubscribes like was I spent all weekend creating this amazing content for you and you're you're all unsubscribing my lesson now having been writing emails for five years or so it's just the cycle of email newsletters it's like life right you live and you die and it's okay for someone to be interested in your topic for a period of time and then at a certain point they're like I've outgrown this or I thought it would be interesting and it's not or they just don't like your Vibe they might just like not like how you write and that's okay and it's all about how do you cultivate a group of people that do that do connect with you and what you're talking about a lot of people they look at number of subscribers but if you're looking at engagement okay you unsubscribe that's a signal there but It ultimately sort of helps our engagement metrics if you weren't going to stay subscribed and not engage with the content it's basically for people listening it's how do you build an infinite Sales Machine and a lot of people are gains paid for a lot of valid reasons like it costs money when you can go on social and get it for free but I always think about it as like R&D like marketing R&D try it out see if it works I question email newsletters that have high percentage of paid subscribers so I don't think it should be your like the only way you're acquiring resour I think the Grassroots social events Community that's going to be your bread and butter but definitely trying out different channels would you agree that every newsletter should be thinking should be trying it at least yeah I have a problem with absolutes so I'll say uh maybe almost every I agree with you and I think there are sort of these strategic Windows where you could use it uh for example one thing and this is sort of getting off topic uh you could use paid ads for a similar purpose but we've often use the newsletter itself to sort of split test a value proposition because we know within a matter of hours which one resonates better whereas if that was a web split test and we threw that on the landing page it could take weeks or months to do that you could do a similar thing with paid ad to just see okay which value prop gets more clicks or which value prop gets more attention you have a new paid platform where ADS are underpriced that might be another Arbitrage that you can jump on so that's what I mean by strategic like using Pay ass in a strategic way that's a really good point you bring up whenever some New Media format or ad format comes out or a new platform comes out there's always an opportunity to be first movers there like the example I use is Zinga which was the maker of a lot of very popular Facebook games back in like you're showing our ages Greg we are showing our age but at the same time it's like history repeats itself Zinga basically Mark pinkis has this idea he wants to to create games on top of Facebook when Facebook launched something called Facebook connect it was basically an app ecosystem on top of Facebook he took advantage of not only all the different apis at the time that allowed you to like do something on one of these games it would basically automatically post a lot of the things that you were doing within the games onto your Facebook feed so for example like I you know made it to the next level and then Drew would see it and then he'd be like oh what's Farmville and I'd click in you click in and sign up to the game it started taking off virally but then they also supplemented with Facebook ads and Facebook ads was the brand new platform at the time and we're really showing our age because I I remember when you can get a click on Facebook for 5 cents now that's like probably on average a dollar so it was 20 times cheaper back then when Mark pinkis was buying ads if you're building something you really want to take note of like what's new right now should I be spending money on Tik Tok ads newsletters are you know are way bigger today than they were five years ago absolutely so it's like should I be spending money on newsletter ads this what it brings us to the next Topic in the list uh one thing I've been thinking a lot about is uh we don't have a big presence on YouTube yet but hearing the way that Jay clae and Pat walls they talk about the Affinity of their YouTube audience relative to like a Twitter audience that Affinity sounds like it's so much stronger and my theory is because you're like engaging more senses it's like a higher Fidelity medium so you just you have the opportunity to build stronger connections there uh the next thing I have listed is around uh faceless YouTube channels a lot of content that we already watch is faceless we just don't think about it that way but when you build a faceless YouTube channel it has certain attributes where there's no key person risk uh I'm very obsessed with Building Systems so if you could build a system around this you could go horizontal and cover different topics uh and I have a few channels listed in a sheet these are all faceless uh YouTube channels and then some of these people they'll go after multiple topics like uh this guy the market whisper he has one video 1.9 million views which is the power of these Discovery platforms where put out a podcast without being unknown and get 1.9 million listens uh so it just shows the power of the algorithm there uh but that's another thing I'm thinking a lot about and we're actively pursuing right now and a faceless YouTube channel does that just mean it's just around topics there's no uh sort of talking face to it or there technically could be a talking face the way if you've seen uh I think it's Synthesia you have these like avatars a lot of face faceless YouTube channels that I'm talking about they don't even have that they're using animations or even b-roll whether it's uh sort of static images or like Boll videos or sometimes they'll insert uh sort of interview clips and there are huge channels out there like finatics uh real engineering is another one real life lore is a huge Channel there's some AI explained there are a lot of AI YouTube channels that are popping up and I can't get enough of them two- minute papers is another one so I'm looking at asianometry yeah so they've got 577 th000 YouTube subscribers which is huge and it's a channel on science technology history if you're interested in the subject matter they can keep your attention I'm a subscriber yeah I'm looking at this now I always like to look at their most popular videos that'll give you a sense of you know what's Landing with the audience so the number one video that they have why the Soviet computer failed second what eating the rich did for Japan third how the Soviets landed on Venus fourth India's semiconductor failure and and fifth how the rich ate South Korea and it even sounds like they're using like 11 Labs or voice cloning with the recent videos they're different sort of levels of automation that you could step up or step down here but if you're obsessed with systems you could take this pretty far and like Greg said 577 th000 subscribers the other interesting opportunity for folks is to do faceless or yeah let's say let's faceless with uh in different languages someone took one of my videos my welcome video on YouTube this AI company called rasque Ai and they basically took my video and they made it they showed it me uh speaking in Spanish uh perfectly and Chinese perfectly and French uh perfectly little do they know I do speak French um so I don't need your help there uh although they made you know my accent is like a a a Quebec accent and theirs is this very nice French Parisian accent so maybe it did make me sound better but anyways my point here is there's a huge opportunity and you're seeing this with Mr Beast too too where he creates channels that or content in different languages faceless Chinese faceless French faceless Spanish huge opportunity if you haven't experimented with 11 labs yet that's it's just a flip of the switch in terms of how you can switch languages now this is more of a short-term Arbitrage and I think this is a long-term business opportunity but I watch a lot of comedy on YouTube and you see uh these channels that will pop up where they're just taking Snippets or they're building these compilations of standups from other Comedians and you've seen the comedians they're like I don't mind if people do that because you're basically spreading my message even if it's monetized or you're in you're just amplifying their message by compiling or taking Snippets and making shorts out of these longer videos that they put together can you talk more about 11 Labs I'm sure not everyone knows what they do it's voice cloning software and it's very good so started messing around with 11 Labs maybe like a year ago and you give it a three minute sample of your voice voice and then it does a pretty good representation of your voice so let's talk about a simple workflow uh you go to GPT for you say hey give me a video script on the history of semiconductors then you go to 11 labs and you read out a prompt that they give you so they can sort of build a model of your voice you take the script from GPT 4 you add that to 11 labs and now you're reading the script that you use GPT for to create and if it doesn't sound enough like you uh they have different to Tunes or different ways that you can tune the voice it's very powerful you know one second you only know English the next second you can be speaking Spanish or Japanese or whatever what's so cool about it is it looks like you actually are speaking Japanese I've seen what it does to your mouth I've used 11 laps it's it's very very similar and also really good and also like pretty cheap like I think it's like 11 bucks a month yep y I think they have a $5 a month plan but they have removed a lot of features uh from that plan yeah but it starts at 5 and then there's 11 I think 99 it goes up from there if you were creating a faceless YouTube channel or faceless video channel which space would you would you do it in and and what yeah what would what would be your concept so I played with this before funny enough on uh economic history and there was a little bit of evidence of demand for this there's a faceless YouTube channel called economics explained where they talk about sort of current issues of like hey what's going on in Argentina right now around currency issues uh and I would probably try to take a mix of like what are you genuinely interested in and what is there evidence of demand of uh I listened to an episode with you and I believe it was Jay CL and you guys talked about the artist versus the distributor uh and I think you need to be the artist if you're going to play a game for a long time and get compound returns but you also need to be a distributor because it can be hard to to stay motivated if there's no feedback loop at all or there's no evidence of demand for what you're building out uh so I would first ask like what topic have I been interested in for a while and would I be interested in producing content around and then also what is there evidence of demand for do faceless YouTube channels all get commoditized at a certain point like if everyone has the ability to use chat GPT 11 Labs access to YouTube basically information becomes pretty commoditized and the production of the information becomes pretty commoditized yeah where's the mo like why even do it okay it seems like faceless YouTube channels I still think there's a significant Mo when it comes to editing there are let's go to economics explain for example they've been putting out videos for years and you can look at the style of the video and the style of the animations and tell they're pulling from a stock library in terms of assets that they've built up over time they they're they come from a certain angle when it it come to their brand using certain colors uh the best example of this might be a YouTube channel called the operations room there are other channels that have popped up uh going after a similar Market but they still haven't sort of reached that that quality of editing that the operations room has I'm just checking this now operation room 1.05 million YouTube subscribers creating battle map animations of the most important battles and events in history they found it interesting way to monetize when it comes to sponsors because looking at this channel on the surface you're like okay they have a decent following on YouTube how the hell would you monetize this and then you watch the videos and you'll notice that a lot of uh game companies when it comes to uh like games that are sort of built around Wars or War scenarios have sponsored this channel U but I think that's non-intuitive because if I didn't have that context I would be thinking okay cool idea it can gain traction but on a scale of 1 to 10 how monetizable is this and on the surface I wouldn't say this is very monetizable but I'm wrong uh they found an interesting way to go about it but that that's another aspect that you want to think about right I think on the other side of that going back to what we were saying around Zinga new format sometimes the most nonobvious places to advertise are the highest Roi places to advertise so if I have a firstperson shooter game that I'm launching in 3 months I might be like okay I got to sponsor uh a Mr Beast video and I got to sponsor a this big you you know gaming channel whereas like those are already priced to Perfection versus something like this which you know seems nonobvious but when you when you talk about it it's like yeah this that makes a lot of sense and as much time as I spend thinking about things that don't change we talked about this earlier with Facebook and Zinga that a lot of businesses and a lot of media companies are built on these short-term arbitrages that exist right because other people people realize okay Greg is using this sort of un unorthodox strategy you know they're going to start trying to sponsor similar channels as well and that Arbitrage eventually closes a lot of big businesses start via Arbitrage opportunities absolutely we don't give Arbitrage as as much credit as as it it deserves is it worth doing faceless YouTube If the mode is isn't as big you can build some really big faceless YouTube channels right now like build up pretty big audiences and then actually use those to drive traffic to maybe your own personal brand a substack or something I saw yeah asianometry you know they've got 600,000 YouTube subscribers but they've got 20,000 email subscribers so they were able to basically take their faceless YouTube Channel Drive email Subs which is pretty valuable right if you're value each sub at $45 like they've created almost $100,000 of value via their faceless YouTube channel that's the other thing about Arbitrage and marketing aratar is it's often a really good way to build something uh and then direct it to something and not a lot of people are talking about it I think a lot of people are bullish on YouTube right now but I don't hear a lot of talk of platform risk I'm reading a book uh same as ever from Morgan howel and he talks about the idea of risk and like Risk is what you don't see and we're not going to talk about platform risk when it comes to YouTube until we have to until there's an event it's like you know it's coming you just don't know when like you can't predict but you need to be prepared so always have that funnel right of hey YouTube is great for Discovery it's great for growth but always be driving to a more own channel where there's less platform risk it's interesting because everyone will agree with you that Instagram X platforms like that have platform risk but YouTube like no one really talks about it you know because what they say is well it has search built into it and because it has search built into it your videos will always get found and the truth is not necessarily the algorithm changes I mean there are so many things that could change uh there's this sort of um competitive relationship between like platform and creator that exists and it's a friendly relationship at First YouTube is well beyond this but when a network or Marketplace is trying to get liquidity they're very very Creator friendly and then once they reach liquidity they start to try to capture more and more of that value and of course it's hard to replace a Marketplace or social network because Network effects are so strong to go back to Moes but there is this antagonistic relationship that's also always there whether we talk about it or not we talked about some AI tools and I know you got a lot of thoughts on Niche AI tools and the opportunities there I think the latest example of this would be the the roll out of Uh custom gpts where you immediately saw a wave of uh I'll call them op-eds on Twitter where people are coming out with this meme that open AI is like killing startups with every feature that they release I may be in the minority here but I have this other View and I compare it to Shopify which for a long time didn't have abandoned cart recovery functionality but they had Shopify apps that did have this so Shopify rolls this out what does that mean for the plugins that means the plugins are more free to make design concessions to Pro sellers or beginner sellers because Shopify has to make millions and millions and millions of users happy so they're designing towards the middle they're designing towards the average but if you're building a custom GPT or you're building a quote unquote chat GPT rapper you can afford to make design concessions because you're not building for the tens of millions of users that open AI has uh so I think that it brings more attention when you see these companies attempt to Sherlock which is a like term from Apple it brings more attention to the problem of oh I can analyze PDFs with this and then they eventually hit a roadblock of I can't use open AI to do this and it wouldn't make sense for open AI to build that feature out because it's such a niche feature but they can go to these other tools to do that a few of the PDF aai guys who are were building in that space were were pretty pissed to put it lightly about what happened with the recent updates to chat GPT because they were making tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars a month now that feature is really baked in but the argument that they're making is it's never going to be as good and as niche as what they're they're building I'll give you another example I've been playing around with custom gpts and my expectation was that sure we could use it to upload all Trends Pro reports and then ask questions of those it works great for that speed issues aside which they'll figure out but what it doesn't work great for is execution if I want it to let's say make new predictions about a new Market but have that prediction informed by like the style or uh the format of the way that we make predictions making sure there's evidence Uh custom gpts right now are not great at execution or content creation at all so if you have a company like a chatbase which gave you that functionality before perhaps they can go you know to that pocket or for that problem which it looks similar on the surface but they're fundamentally different problems it's a search problem versus a creation problem wonder if there's a faceless YouTube Channel idea meet a niche AI software tool idea somewhere in there there are a lot of like the AI explainer or AI explain but the are you saying slap a faceless YouTube channel in front of a tool use that for growth that would be cool yeah yeah just build a network of all these eyeballs of people you have that proprietary distribution you're not competing with others as cost of acquisition is going up that's a cool idea I'm just spitballing but there's definitely a lot of opportunity people say don't build these rapper ideas it's going to go no you know you're going to get beat up and people say oh you know chat GPC store is cute but I don't know I think it's certainly worth experimenting in yeah there's another take out there and this caus a paradigm shift for me where uh a lot of people are saying like yeah we're fully expecting our company to be sherlocked by open AI or another company we're going to get the money while the getting is good now and then take those skills and Lobby that into another opportunity that's not the way I like to build businesses I like to play long-term games but it's hard to argue against the fact that you still have those skills that it took to build that first business even if there's some creative destruction going on there uh by way of open AI or another company and for the record Sherlock means the larger incumbent basically copies your feature and just gives it away for free Alfred is a tool that's on where you could do like command spacebar and search for any app and then Apple add Spotlight uh to do the same thing right so now they've taken Alfred's customers so I still use Alfred even though Spotlight exists there's like a a good Steve Jobs quote around this I'm going to see if I can pull it up sure Steve Jobs told this founder his last name is wood he that he was going to copy his app it says here's wood paraphrasing a phone call from Steve Jobs himself you know those hand cars the little machines that people stand stand on and pump to move along on the train tracks that's caria I guess that's the name of that app Apple is the steam train that owns the tracks so basically what Steve Jobs is saying here is listen we own the train tracks and you're just coming along for the ride the reality is that's how a lot of big platforms think including open AI including YouTube they you know they invest Millions sometimes billions into these Networks and into these technologies that they are okay to be able to copy it and I think that you just need to be aware you got to wake up every day being like is today the day I'm getting copied that's the reality of Entrepreneurship nowadays something else you have these larger companies it's not only a question of okay who's making design concessions and who can afford to build for the smaller more specific audience and make that group of people happier it's also a question of focus where you have apple they have apple music a lot of people still use Spotify like how many things can this large company focus on at once and do well so it's also a question of focus that I think may be a contributing factor to why some of these smaller companies build better products for some people you could use the alarm app on your iPhone but perhaps you want to wake up to a podcast episode instead of a stock music sound or something and that's where we get into this pocket of design concessions the cool thing about building Niche soft software is you could get really weird with uh design Styles like you could just like put sound on your app you could use a lot of bright colors when most software is either black or white what I encourage people to do and a lot of the software we build actually at lay checkout is just like the bit out there stuff because we think that that's the stuff that's going to will linger in people's brains and create Lasting Impressions and even if a large incumbent copies it people might just love the design enough and the brand enough that they might just support it and continue there's also this idea of counter positioning where you make it expensive for an incumbent to copy you maybe because they're serving Enterprise customers and they want this new market you know that you're capturing but they have to give up so much to chase after this new market that you're playing for that they just won't do it it's too expensive for them you got this this other thing here which I I'm curious about productizing execution you're seeing a lot of these productized services or unlimited agencies it could be sales as a service or design as a service or you don't see this a lot uh but there are companies out there that are doing uh development as a service in some places that if we were to do something like this the way we run operations is very Advanced we use a tool called process street we have a lot of make workflows which is like a zappier alternative but more powerful uh and then I have a lot of founder friends that are sort of very stressed about you know the way operations run and we're able to spend a lot of time doing project level work versus operations work the product TI service would sort of be bringing peace of mind to uh like other established companies when it comes to operations making sure that things run smoothly you also have sales as a service and there are a few companies out there like uh cyber leads from my friend Alex comes to mind where he basically lands clients for agencies as a service and that's a skill set that we built up by doing Outreach my concern there is that this is a like higher level investment where it may take us away from our core Focus but you're seeing a lot of companies have success around this and I think anytime you can sell peace of mind or anytime you can sell increased Revenue those are generally services that tend to land really well with people process Street first time I have heard of it I'm just curious like what is it and why is it a lot of people they talk about notion or they talk about up for example and it it's not the same uh the way I think about process street we have living documentation and what I mean by living documentation is at the point that our operations Veer from the way that we have a documented process there's like a forcing function in process street that makes you update your documentation so none of our documentation gets stale because it's like hey why did you check this sub requirement if it's not true oh we don't do it that way anymore then update that sub requirement if it like puts your Sops in front of your face and I think it's like a 110 step workflow in process Street which is a lot but it also guarantees like consistent quality for us I could go down a rabbit hole here in terms of uh like patterns that you want to follow when you building a workflow out yeah it gets pretty deep which is why I thought about this as a service or even a course or something because you can go very very deep when it comes to uh operations and systems design if you're listening to this and you're looking for opportunity right now like sometimes there's profit in the boring and I'm obsessed with it I find it boring so if if you need your operations uh smooth out or things are on fire right now reach out to me we can figure something out there you go I want to end with some sticky thoughts that you can't stop thinking about I spend a lot of time thinking about things that don't change or things that are true but it seems like as a civilization like we're on this path of Leverage where IND individuals have more power and small groups have more power there are different indicators that you can look for in this of like how smaller companies now that are being Acquired and for what price they're being acquired for so if you look at what's at I forget the exact acquisition price but let's just say $1 19 billion dollar how big was that team about 30 people okay now rewind 10 or 30 or 100 years ago and are there any comparables no because you have this ability for individuals and smaller groups to have more impact more reach per person than you had before and then I can point to different topics like no code that we've covered or SAS or million-dollar oneperson businesses they're all evidence of this quote unquote Metatron of individual leverage another is this idea of permissionless innovation think about radio stations for example where you needed to get a license or to have your own television show you needed to have uh sort of in the industry for 8 10 15 years uh before someone gives you you that chance and now it's like your excuses are being removed you don't have to have a printing press start a newsletter there are more opportunities for permissionless Innovation also specialization uh niches where that's pretty self-explanatory but it's like the world is getting more and more specialized and you have Niche businesses uh and then centralization and decentralization like how the hell can both of these be true at the same time uh so centralization something that's very top of M for me is the uh executive order that just passed where they're basically putting an upper limit on like how much processing power you can harness to build a AI model or before you notify the government so I think that's an example of centralization where you still have these bottlenecks or another example would be Facebook or x with like an algorithm change and how much impact that has from the centralized entity and then decentralization you have uh open source when it comes to the ability to be able to like fork and modify any project or crypto the way you can sort of dis intermediate Banks and go around Bank now I'm not sure if that means like the world is becoming more extreme or more volatile or what but this is what I'm seeing by you know diving into different markets and ideas like these things are evident in each one so you're like me because You' got a ton of ideas a ton of things you're interested in and a lot of people listening to this pot are like us too like they're all kids in in candy shops so what do you do when you're a kid in a candy shop and you're trying to prioritize what you should actually be building this is so tough I feel like I lucked into something where I have an excuse to dive into all of these areas maybe one answer could be to sort of build a personal brand where your brand is built around trying a lot of different things like Sam is trying out custom gpts this week and AI avatars next week he's actually building this quote unquote boring sass on the side and even after he sells that SAS he still has his brand to fall back on and may start the next business on the back of that personal brand and the audience that he's built in the connections that he's built in that personal brand uh so the answer may be not to combine these two things sort of find the the boring thing thing that brings the bacon home and then still have your personal brand built around experimenting on the side and that's why I like the whole multipreneur model because it allows you to be curious and monetize your curiosity which is crazy but you do need to have like guard rails be like I'm doing you know I'm doing everything here on this list that we've just talked about tools and you know faceless YouTube channels and stuff like and especially all at the same time you know I think that's the mistake a lot of people make the way I've made this a habit for a few years is embracing this idea of uh Comfort challenges so it could be as simple as you know each day I'm going to do something new or scary or uncomfortable and it doesn't even have to be related to business right it could be building a custom GPT or trying that restaurant around the corner but it's building sort of this muscle of you know doing uncomfortable things or doing new things I heard this uh story from Danny postma he built and sold a company around AI written marketing copy but the way he got Early Access is he emailed the CEO right for some people that would make them super nervous but for him he probably had this muscle built up and he's like you know it makes me a little nervous but I'm going to go ahead and do it and then look what look at what that turned into for him right the what do I have to lose muscle is a good muscle to have if you want to get rewarded on the internet yeah and you have to use it for it to grow right so like make that a habit totally all right Drew Riley the insights per minute ipms were off the charts as expected you want more Drew Riley I recommend checking out Trends podcast where uh you talked recently about product I Services vertical software you're just diving into new markets and sharing some of the opportunities there so and where else could people find you uh you can find me on Twitter at Drew r or d r l y and thanks for having me Greg it's been fun of course and if people want more Drew to come back on the show and you like this format and don't be shy go on YouTube throw a

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
it's crazy 75% of kids today want to be YouTubers when they grow up they don't want a 9 to5 they want to turn their passion into lucrative income but many parents are pretty skeptical of letting their children dedicate time to creating content they see it more as a hobby not a career and while it's true that the world of content creation is so saturated today that it could be hard to stand out in fact some people do more than just game popularity on YouTube they take their ideas even further generating millions of dollars of year of Revenue one of the best examples Amanda ra Lee when she started her YouTube channel as a hobby at the young age of 14 she had no idea that it would pave the way for a multi-million dollar business that would change her life forever my name is Greg Eisenberg and in today's video I'm going to break down the framework that successful entrepreneurs like Amanda Thomas Frank Brian holiday and many other others have used their passion and turned it into a profitable business the ACP funnel which stands for audience Community product and the best part you could do it too let's get started stage one audience as I mentioned in the intro Amanda started her YouTube in 2013 at age 14 initially making simple videos about DIY crafts makeup and fashion while she only got a few thousand views a video she didn't give up kept uploading new videos on a regular basis because it was fun and she wanted to find a community to share her passions with outside her town outside her city outside her country 5 years into the journey she discovered bullet journaling an organizational system to schedule and plan her daily tasks she posted her first bullet video journal in 2017 and it went completely viral pretty much right after she posted it she hit 100,000 subscribers so she knew she was on to something at the time not many people were talking about this sort of thing so she made the transition to a bullet journaling channel the niche resonated super well with her audience and her Channel began to grow super fast the more videos she was creating she found both her Niche and her audience art stationary and journaling stage two Community when a Amanda started diving into bullet journaling things really took off her videos were resonating deeply with her audience instead of chasing new trends she niched down and with each new video her community grew stronger and stronger her videos weren't just about vlogging and random lifestyle videos it was taking shape around her passions so she started building communities around her passions productivity organization it transitioned from an audience to more of a group of friends bonding on things they liked this was only possible because Community Building remained a central aspect throughout Amanda's Journey she was always in the comment sections of her Instagram and YouTube the comment sections felt more like a group chat with Amanda instead of a broadcast and this didn't just help her grow her Channel it provided a ready market for her products people constantly asked about the product she was using in her videos and they were asking how can I buy these products so audience Buy in check Community Buy in check stage three product fast forward to 2019 and Amanda took a bold step leveraging her community of over 2 million subscribers on YouTube She launched shop Amanda rage Le turning her love for drawing and bullet journaling into a tangible business offering a range of planners notebooks and accessories she created products that were a perfect fit for her specific audience and this is a perfect example of why creators Niche down defining who your audience is helps Define what your business should be one thing that helped Amanda succeed in her transition from Creator to entrepreneur was her ability to creatively address challenges and maintain a positive relationship with her audience despite the setbacks this became obvious when in the 2021 doodle planner one of her products had multiple printing errors during launch instead of discarding the faulty planners she decided to rename them the oops planners and sell them at a discounted price Amanda's content creation career has succeeded in many other areas Beyond her own business she also had the opportunity to collaborate with Major Brands like Sephora Adobe and Google further expanding her Horizons Beyond YouTube and her stationary business she even worked with Warner Brothers to create some drawings for the film detective Pikachu back in 2019 pretty damn cool and even to this day Amanda is still creating YouTube videos and sharing her experiences and Lessons Learned along her entrepreneurial journey through different platforms she advises aspiring creators on the importance of authenticity recognizing burnout and not allowing mistakes to hinder progress the story of Amanda is one I love because it shows a blend of passion Community engagement and a learning mindset that helped her transition from a young girl to a content creator to a business owner in a niche she loves so the next time your kid tells you they want to be a YouTuber don't reject the idea so fast who knows they might grow up to be the next Amanda rley if you like this breakdown you're going to love my other videos on the ACP funnel where I tear down some of the biggest internet Empires

Title: Creating Content Is More Profitable Than Software
Published: 2023-11-26 13:00:18 UTC
Description:
https://www.youtube.com/@GregIsenberg

Content and software have something in common: they’re both words in a database that you present to people (either for free or for a price).

The main difference between them is that you don’t need a large team to create content every day - one or two people are more than enough to produce a consistent output.

Persuasion can be short-lived.

So when it comes to forming business partnerships, the key to long-term success isn't just persuasion; it's about finding collaborators who share your passion and genuinely want to build something meaningful. 

No matter how persuasive you think you are, things won’t work out if there’s no authentic commitment.

Description:
https://www.youtube.com/@GregIsenberg

Some creators deliberately try to spark a strong reaction in their audience.

Why?

Because in the world of content creation, being polarizing can be a game-changer.

The more your content repels a large portion of people, the more it attracts a niche audience.

is this content going to repel some large portion of people because if it is going to repel some large portion of people it will attract another large portion of people and so it's an edge it's an opinion it's a perspective where I think that you're correct on kind of this over supply of newsletters is everyone who just creates the same thing with a different name on top and is regurgitating the same content yeah that's not going to work in my opinion

https://www.youtube.com/@GregIsenberg

In the pursuit of economic freedom, we often fixate on increasing our income. 

However, the real game-changer lies in understanding and managing our expenses—both financial and mental.

The lower your expectation, the lower your need.

This is the best way to optimize for high “returns”.

all of these entrepreneurs they get to the top and then they're like uh I just want to go make content now I want to build an audience cuz it's much harder to do anything else if you don't have an audience we got close to David saaks and he invited us to his 50th birthday party which is like insanity all of these billionaires wanted to talk to us a decent amount we like interested in what we're doing because they don't have the sort of reach that they want no one will listen to them if they put out something no one knows who they are just walking down the street and they want to be recog ized and known and adored Dylan and Henry clip boys thanks Greg good to be here happy to be here uh usually I invite people on this podcast and I just say just show up but with you two I actually threw a document your way and I said throw some ideas throw some things that you're thinking about because you guys you guys can go out of hand here you know I need to I need to put you in a box a little bit I was gonna say we're we're the show up guys so we we felt very bakas in by you but it'll be good I was telling Henry uh cuz a lot of these were like ideas trends that we're seeing it's kind of the same idea when people ask us like oh how do you know what videos to shoot like where do you get your topic ideas we're like I don't know they're just everywhere we just see them constantly but like business ideas I don't know if our brains just like turned off to like looking for new ideas we had to force this one one of my ideas I copied from Shan pory my only idea yeah you want to start with that one let's start with that one your only your only idea is somebody else's idea credit to Shan pory of my first million podcast how we got our start was uh building out his podcast Studio there he was like you guys are sick at video like I think there's this huge video Trend you should be on top of it and I think one of the ideas that would work really well is related to this what the big short did Magic what they did was they have someone like Margot Robbie or Selena Gomez come on and teach this sort of nerdy business finance topic they're hot celebrities so everyone everyone's just like holy [ __ ] look look at this hot celebrity teaching me something what if you just had this company this Media company that was just hot chicks teaching nerdy subjects oh it's brilliant because who's the audience it's like nerdy guys and then who do they want to watch it's like beautiful women that I know this idea is like probably appeals to like a 25-year-old dude like uh like us at the time um but I see so much opportunity there because they're they're fairly valued in the marketplace of like Instagram or Tik Tok like brands are reaching out to them but all these like super attractive people they don't know how to make money like Henry and I we got a billion views last year and we have no idea how to make money off of that it's like if we can't figure it out and we care about business like imagine the girl in Brooklyn like what is she doing so it's like if you have uh this Media company that's just built around creating awesome content of just teaching nerdy stuff um that's the dream but like the tangible thing you could start day-to-day is like just doing this for other companies as an agency Sean was even equating it to like only fans he's like put it behind a pay wall these nerdy guys want to pay to see hot sexy Margot Robbie explain I don't know what a a CD is a CDO um put it behind a pay wall and so now you've got this like you've got this really high quality education content as kind of a play on only fans if someone wants to start this what would you do would you like go in go on Instagram sign some some women probably start on Craigslist uh Craigslist I would probably say like okay like if we were to do this I would probably want to tap into the discoverability of like Tik Tok and Instagram reals like these short and YouTube shorts these shortterm short form platforms that so like if you wanted to do this tomorrow you probably go find a goodlooking friend go watch The Big Short see what they taught create a bunch of Tik toks see if you can get traction here's the thing though I think that's like the media company side is like okay you want to get traction and stuff but really you don't need that if you're running them as ads so my buddy was actually starting to do this but I think I don't know why he flaked off of this but basically he just went on Instagram reals and I don't know his algorithm just feeds him hot girls so like that speaks to what he's into but like you find the person that maybe has like 10,000 followers they're they're probably not making a lot of money they're like struggling with brand deals it's a headache um so they're just like waiting waiting for people to hit them up so he had DMD a couple dozen and like their rates are incredibly low and he can just do like these sample edits they'll do a placement for like $250 or 500 bucks something like that if that every attractive girl like they're just the supply is outrageous um so it's just like having an agency just my Niche is just hot girl agency and it's like you want it for granted you might have to Rebrand if you're going with like bigger clients but um if you just focus on that you just DM them connect them and then you can just do kind of Arbitrage basically try charge when know 10 grand for a bundle the these exist too it's like ugc agency where I think gone and bundled up a bunch of these creators that have a ton of views but don't know how to make money and you can go pay them 50 bucks for a clip a 100 bucks for a clip 150 I think it's it's just that simple simple spin only Attractive people maybe it's not just hot girls it could be hot guys too but it's like only Attractive people basically what you're saying is you're taking boring Concepts you're you're marrying it with beautiful people boring Concepts beautiful people who would want to go after this idea it's like a young 20s something like imagine if just everyone you work with is just a hot girl if our content wasn't doing well I would probably do this idea which and you you actually you mentioned like because you guys get millions of views and you said you have issues monetizing it like why why it's hard I've got a million and a half subscribers Dylan's nearing in on a million it's really hard to go get that audience to actually go do do something you really need to nail the the your content and the audience fit if you want to go do something um so like in our case the thing we had before our content popped off was clip. Co our our kind of uh Animation Studio it's an agency that's like a premium product it's expensive animated explainer videos we do that is not a good fit for the 19y olds that watch our free content on YouTube the the key part is we refuse to do ads one people refuse to do them with us like YouTube shorts which is where we were popping off we'd get like million views every short we put out but it's like early on shorts even now it's probably early so people would be like hey we'd sponsor this if it were a Tik Tok but it's on YouTube and we don't know how to Value YouTube short so it's just easier for us to like make money through an agency and then just not monetize our content it's just always been a real headache to just work with Brands so it's just easier for us to productize something else and sell that even if only 0 1% of our audience is even open to that as an option we're in like the first inning of creators even figuring out how to monetize of like YouTube content up until a few years ago like the Playbook was just you make your videos and you get sponsorships you get add dollars so people are like still trying to figure out how to actually move my audience to to go somewhere I really like uh Jeremy gfin he was on invest like the best and uh and yeah so all Canadians are smart and he was talking about how creators monetize and he's basically like traditionally it was maybe sell like a $10 t-shirt to 30% of your audience or maybe it's uh Community that's 100 bucks a month and you saw that to like 5% of your audience but he's he's bullish on the future which is you're only going to sell to one person and it's going to be to get equity in their company which could be a hundred million deal so use your entire audience just to like find that one person who's going to give you a sweet deal on their awesome company and that's where I think uh it's really interesting just to look at the like know sort of Tim Farah's approach of like super high priced or free so we've kind of taken the approach like hey we're just going to make a shitload of free content and then like if you want this super high-priced thousands of dollars a month agency or tens of thousands then you can do that but for everyone else it's totally free like Alex hormos is running that exact framework make as much free content as he possibly can and then the only thing he's selling is basically access to companies or acquisitions.com where you're giving up a piece of your comp for them to to invest you know for Heros to win big like he doesn't need to do a lot of deals you know he can do two deals a year get 20 30 40 50% of these businesses and people come to him and they like they're begging for him to partner because they've they're obsessed with him and it's like almost become like a hosy lifestyle hormos Nation Henry was talking about yesterday he went to an Omas sushi place just because he heard Jo briefly no flex yeah it's a flex and a plug go listen to our podcast I was listening to Tim Ferris Tim Ferris plugged this movie Jiro Dreams of Sushi yep so I go watch that I fall in love with jro this sushi chef so I'm primed Joe Rogan hops on his um podcast with Elon Musk and in just literally 10 seconds he offhandedly is like hey uh Elon you ever been to this awesome sushi place called Sushi by scratch or something they're in Texas and Chicago and whatever Beverly Hills um elon's like No And they move on and I'm like sign me up jro Dreams of Sushi I trust Joe Rogan and 10 seconds later I I booked a reservation it's crazy we were talking about that with like kind of why we don't want to do brand deals is because you want to avoid the FTX or like just losing any credibility it's likey if we just never sell anything like we're just only building trust and like when we do sell something it's our own product product which we we've created ourselves like honestly we haven't promoted clipped or company in the past very much because we're like it's kind of like a six out of 10 product right now like we're not proud enough to like promote it to our audience we want to like go back and refine it which is kind of like what we've been doing the last couple months is like getting it to an eight out of 10 ideally 10 out of 10 um and then we can come back and sell it and we know like everyone that buys the product is going to have the best experience now they're going to trust us even more um so that that trust factor is like something that we're really conscious of it's interesting because what do you charge like five 10 grand a month seven now yeah it depends but yeah you might you might look at that and be like it's such a pain to actually deal with that price point although it sounds like a lot of money and you might be like my price point is gonna be 25,000 a month or 35,000 a month and that's the Jeremy gfin point which is which is I was just talking about this on my first million actually episode will be out by the time this this comes live Henry threw the sushi Flex I figured I'd uh hit him back I was telling Sean and Sam about average client size for late checkout are Innovation agency so that's the agency that partners with like Dropbox and companies big big big companies and helps them do product zero to one and the average size is a million dollars a deal so it's like you don't have to do so many deals for it to be worth it I actually think that agencies a lot of these like Creator Le agencies and agencies in general are going to go more lowend and like cheap cheap cheap or like high-end hundreds of thousands of dollars per year uh customer value you said that in passing speaking you said that of like yeah our average deals is like hundred grand or more a month they wanted to move on and just go like what's slate check out like about design I'm like dude your your [ __ ] purchase size is like this is what they're subscribed to and they'll stay with you for a decade or whatever it might be it's like that seemed insane to me and I'm like why isn't everyone trying to cra crack that code cuz Greg clearly figured it out it's a tough racket first of all you have to say no to smaller deals which is really a lot of self-discipline and then I also think that doing deals with like the Nike size companies of the world like you really have to do a lot of relationship building there's a lot of shmooing involved and building smoo with us yeah it's it's it's it's a lot of a cheap schmoozer shaking hands and kissing babies you know but if you have an audience you're kind of like doing shmoozing indirectly you don't have to moves with Joe Rogan you're just going to work with him because you know it's Joe Rogan totally it's kind of the shortcut having a pod being on YouTube like it builds Affinity my buddy runs Corp Dev at this really large tech company Corp Dev is it's the people who buy companies it's like head of mergers and Acquisitions so let's say like zck wants to buy clipped Zuck would be like okay let me CC my head of Corp Dev and that person is actually going to like negotiate the deal and get the transaction done you'll be interfacing with that person this guy was like um the president of our company shared um your Tweet in our slack and said like everyone look at this so what did I do this morning I woke up knowing that I DMD her and was just like hey like let's catch up so I do think that building content is like a shortcut to to the Shmo I actually put this on the dock that you made us fill out the the boxing in in terms of like Trends we're noticing is all of these entrepreneurs they get to the top they've sold their thing they've accomplished their mission their Northstar whatever and then they're like uh yeah I just want to go make content now I want to build an audience cuz they feel like it's that much harder to do anything else if you don't have an audience the story version of that point was we had a a blowup like in a good positive like rocket ship blowup way like a year ago or two years ago I when we were doing clips for the Allin podcast we got close to David saaks and then he invited us to his 50th birthday party which is like insanity all of PayPal like just like the coolest people in Tech um were all there and even like the entertainment world so it's like crazy party but like all of these very rich billionaires they wanted to talk to us decent amount of them were like interested in what we're doing because they don't have the access or like sort of like reach that they want no one will listen to them if they like put out something no one knows who they are yeah just walking down the street and they want to be like recognized so they see sax and chamath getting adored and they're like hey I want that can you guys make me that and so we just saw like hey they're frustrated like what if we just shortcut like just made enough money to like you don't have to stress like let's just get to that level and then just focus on having the reach with the Right audience that was like seeing it tangibly like them asking us for help on this thing one of them was was single speaking of like the hot girl agency and he was like can you help me grow on Instagram because I talked to the founder of Instagram and he's like Instagram is actually the best dating site there is if if you can be popular there then it's like the easiest thing in the world to just DM anybody or they DM you he like just blow me up there cuz I want to like this guy had made all the money he had done all the things but he didn't have a wife and so he's like talking to the the founder of he's probably talking to like Kevin CM he's like can you make me popular on Instagram I think that's just the evolution of status symbols you know status symbols used to be all about cars and houses and physical things but like having a million followers on Instagram or or having almost a million subscribers on YouTube I was talking to a buddy not daily like that's not his name and we were talking about um like my my realization that like the the number one relationship is like in life is the wife or your wife or spouse I should say partner sure partner all of our attention should be focused on like what's the best way to find that person um like even more so than than like making an absurd amount of money he's like dude why are you even thinking about a wife when you don't even have a million subscribers dude it just like get the reach and then it'll be the easiest thing in the world to just like filter for that person all your interests are out in the world and people can see them all the time so it just like filters nicely he'll also like look at all his comments you got to like see your inbound if you're going to like filter through to figure out who's on your wavelength Henry's laughing probably because like all my conversations regress to this like topic of girls and wives and stuff yeah I mean no I was laughing because I think what Nas said is hilarious well it is it is hilarious and I think like so I I met Nas once and he's been on the Pod but I met him in person once I told him to meet me at a place for coffee he walked in and literally everyone is like you know Whispering that's NZ that's n and he goes and we go to order a coffee and you know I'm like I'll have an Americano and what do you want NZ and he's he says yeah I'll have an Americano and the uh Barista is like I did my graduate paper on NAS daily and we we grab the coffees we sit outside I was like does this happen often that you get recognized and stuff like that and he was like everywhere I go I get recognized and I was thinking to myself like is that a good like right yeah maybe maybe what you maybe you found your girlfriend from from this maybe you didn't I'm not sure I think she was a fan actually um but like is that the best liit Mist test for finding a partner I just wouldn't want to get recognized personally I just want to order an Americano so I think there's two schools of thought there's like I want to be famous and I want all of the attention and perks that come with that and then the other school of thought is once I'm wealthy I want to like get off the grid and be like lowkey how do you think about it I can touch on the the being recognized bit maybe Dylan can touch on The Dating bit in terms of being recognized but there's a difference between like alist celebrity in public recognizability and like YouTuber I feel like there's this wall between um audience and A-list celebrities I'll uh Justin Bieber or George Clooney or Selena Gomez those people literally can't go out in public people can't relate to them they almost don't seem like humans whereas like a n in public a Casey neack going through the streets of New York maybe it's this parasocial thing but because we feel like we know them better like they're a friend the audiences don't actually bother them as much uh Counterpoint like Casey cuz Casey's studio is right next to ours we just had the New York City marathon and one buddy invited him so he's like dude I don't want to go run that because I'm just going to get recognized everywhere and it's going to be miserable he hates the fame side of things one of my buddies he was like in terms of like money Fame power like what motivates you I don't know right now it's Fame just cuz I think it'll help me find a wife and like kind of be in cooler Social Circles but like really all I want to do is just play sports all day and like read books and like if I do those two things I'm happy which it doesn't really like slot into any of those categories if you have to pick and you have to order it money money Fame power yeah Power I don't even know what I would do with power well power is kind of like influence I view it as like uh like people will listen to you follow you into battle um I don't need that my my quest is like I need the money so that I can have freedom from all of the things I don't want to do and can only do the things that I have to do I feel like you say that and like you already have a shitload of Freedom yeah no I'm chilling our lives are pretty good I don't know that's kind of why our friends laugh at us cuz like we're probably like the least ambitious ambitious people it's like yeah we want to build something awesome in 50 years but we're in like absolutely no rush to get there it's like why aren't you monetizing these ways are like um if we talk rean it's like oh you could build a community and it's like I don't know it's just not like we're not 100% on that wavelength so it's like we're just not going to do it and like maybe we don't monetize our channel for another three years and we just waste 20 grand a month for that whole time from what I understand you guys are bringing in seven figures of revenue from clip definitely Revenue you're making money on clip yeah and you're taking that money and you're reinvesting in content right correct all of it every every so your plan is that not like the Mr Beast type strategy which is like I reinvest everything in content until you know I have all this attention and all this Goodwill and all we have we have no clue it's until doing it we have no clue we have no clue what's on the other side of until it works so like we'll keep doing it because we haven't seen any downside and it's kind of fun to do there has to be like an outcome right like there has to be a goal that you yeah and for us we hated school can we make learning fun so like that was the mission and right now we're just kind of like blindly trusting the process we're like if we make education content we make it as fun as we possibly can and we build as massive an audience as we possibly can then something will come down the line you know we'll point that into something down the line but for now it was just like make learning fun get views Patrick Campell he he kind of wrot us he's like hey you guys should have like some Vision some some mission to be on and that'll at least like direct you so when you get on podcast you have like something to talk about other than we're lost just figuring things out day to day we've kind of had this like hazy hey school was shitty like we love learning but we hated school that's a problem our version of solving that is like these funny animated South Park sort of clips for nerds and then maybe haot girl agency to do the same thing we really like the educational component of like teaching things like it's cool to see say Harvard put their classes online but it's like I'd rather watch Tik Tok than Harvard CS class how do we smash those two together like get a CS class on Tik Tok here's a business idea for us there you go here's a business idea it might take 10 years all right but in 10 years I could see us having some play on like a con Academy Con Academy is like very technical videos about math equations every student watched them because they weren't learning in class um so maybe we do a play on that it's just a huge library of of the kind of content that we make that makes learning fun um and then students can watch as little as they want to get interested about topics and they can go as deep as they want if we do like full-blown courses or series one of the regrets I actually have is not doubling down in making learning fun as a business we was working on a product called Wall Street Survivor right after the economy crash 2008 and people saw like their net worth go down 50% and we're like I don't understand why what's happening so we built a game around learning how to to play the stock market added Badges and gamification all this stuff I started a YouTube channel and I wrote the scripts and you all appreciate this as animation people we created animated short videos we published it that business by the way ended up selling so that was that was great but I gave up on YouTube animation short form and I just checked and all the videos now I'm looking at them now have hundreds of thousands if not millions of views yeah are you going to plug the channel you check it out it's on you YouTube uh Wall Street Survivor you can check out the early old animation videos my lesson from that is that like dude this this it takes time you know some sometimes it takes 10 years but I do think that you're you're on to something if your mission is to make learning fun I think you're on to something oh these are sick yeah are they actually sick or you just saying that no they are and you've got millions of views I know it's crazy I'm just hovering over them um just like watching the the kind of the thumbnail play but I love it it's like whiteboard animated it's like it actually it's kind of a lot like a Patty Galloway who breaks down creators on a whiteboard our our thing is like we don't know what the best business will be out of this we're probably like 1% monetized on what we could be and it's like okay that that sucks but it's like it's fine 1% is enough for us to like be happy um but like if we keep moving in the direction of dumping all our money back in and we're like we we really like improving all our edits we don't know who's going to compete with us because you got to be ludicrous out of your mind to spend 20 grand a month making these and building the team and like we have access to the best animators in the world so it's like it's just really hard to compete with that we're just going to keep digging our moat and like that's all our job is just keep digging right now and creating something that's the most awesome thing in the world and no one else is going to be able to touch us because they they don't have creators that are fun or it's like fun creators but they don't have 50 Grand a month and 10 years to work on building this moat that's kind of the goal is just build the moat and then whatever Castle we end up wanting to build we we'll build are you guys like running both companies or are you thinking about hiring someone to run clip wait oh both well okay so for for The Listener you have clip agency you have your content ecosystem which is Dylan and Henry and then you have Smart nonsense which is the newsletter right correct and smart nonsense will probably end up being the umbrella for all of the the content stuff we didn't want to promote clip because it was a six out of 10 our job right now is get it to a 10 out of 10 and then hand that off immediately to Henry's brother to run the business side right now it's really painful when we have the opportunity cost of making more content if we can just focus on creating the best content and that's the top of the funnel and then we have enough money to have someone come in and and run it really well that's when the machine's really going to take off like right now we're kind of dabbling in both and it's like this really annoying world of opportunity cost um like we'll be on sales calls right now because we're trying to like improve the product it's like ah why are we doing this when we could be getting 5 million views but it's really temporary we've had the issue of like always leaving a little bit too soon to start the next thing um and not like setting the foundation right which is why we've kind of been in this like one to two million realm with our agency for like two or three years just cuz we like immediately took off to start making content and then that that blew up but then like this starts to fall apart so like we kind of [ __ ] up in that sense but now we're coming back to build the foundation strong and then like hand it off properly so we can focus on content it's still hard and we've had all the luck in the world so it's like godamn if you can make it work like Greg we we like look up to to people like you that that actually Crush business cuz like business is so freaking hard to do successfully especially when you don't like have your best friend as a business partner or um any of the amazing fortunes we have I have like multiple businesses that I'm running the way I see it is you always got to start with one idea get to product Market fit with that one idea hire an operator and hand it off and do it one by one the cool part is you have real product Market fit with clip if people are paying you a million dollars or more like this product Market fit there back I think what happened because our marketing worked really well at certain points in time it would make up for a shitty product so like all in podcast sharing all of our clips and they'd all point back to Henry which points de clipped it's like that just blew up demand like crazy so we could just drop the ball left and right with like not ideal product and it'd still make a million plus dollars a year so you so what you're saying is you have had sales maybe retention wasn't great exactly it'd be awesome if people well stayed for a year or two years or something like that we just like there are ways to build the product better and I think we were like masking a shitty product with just good sales and then when we stops doing like free clips for a nval or David Sachs or like Tim Ferris type all we're getting is word of mouth and that's why we just been like steady state because like we haven't done marketing ever um and it's just not growing because of that and it's kind of a shitty product um but now it's better now we're like figuring out like how to actually improve it so sorry to sorry to cut you off but just pushing back on I don't think we have product Market fit we're starting to get that now if I were you I if I would just be spending 90% of my energy getting product Market fit for clipped because clipped is your oxygen basically I would put a line in in the sand I'd say I want my average customer to last 16 months and I'm gonna do things to to make that happen and these are the five seven things that I'm going to do to make it happen and I wouldn't do anything else like I wouldn't tweet I wouldn't create content I wouldn't do anything else except that once I hit 16 months then I would move on to short form and I would be like okay short form video my goal is to create two pieces of short form content per week and I would only focus on that and wait and with a one product Market fit metric which is could be whatever a thousand likes on a video then once you have that you can't hand that over but you can automate and systematize a lot of it um and make it easier on yourself maybe you hire ahead of like script writing or cont you know there's a lot of ways you can do it then I would move on to the podcast and then I would do that and then I would go and do smart nonsense which is like making learning fun and and easy via the news and do it one by one it's it's a line it's one by one like I call the multi preneurship where multi preneurship works is when you have some dots and you connect it one at a time where it doesn't work is like when you're creating like a circle and you're kind of just like trying to do everything at the same time what do you think of that this is where we've had some uh difficulties we're figuring out exactly what you're say we launched everything too soon so like the newsletter now we we went to this like daily newsletter which I think is awesome but it's also distracting because it takes say just like at least an hour or like a couple hours of Mind space um a day or a week we have that thing running and you have like the shorts content and you're like trying to get to the 16mon uh clipped customer retention um so we just have like a lot of different ball and the podcast we're shooting daily so just like a lot of balls we're juggling and I'm kind of in the mindset of like okay just put newsletter on pause don't focus on growing it or it's in just like focus on the business but Henry's really good at doing multiple things at once so we kind of like get by with just me focusing on one thing and then him kind of keeping everything alive but I don't like that because I'd rather we just both nail one thing because we have a lot of things that could go well but uh we're doing none of them exceptionally well what do you think Henry turn it into the the group therapy yeah it's it's it's like what Dylan said where we're like big zero to one guys as soon as the thing's getting on the tracks we're like okay we we want to manage all these people and like do the same thing over and over again for all of eternity so we always leave at like 0.9 yeah like on the product Market fit thing clipped works for the 30 customers we have this turn thing is is a problem yeah like I don't know if it's a product Market fit thing we like literally didn't know how to do sales so there was no inbound um and we weren't running any sales process on anybody right we had a wait list to like 200 people that we just forgot about and we're like oh [ __ ] and then we hit them up like 6 months later and they're like fig out my problem what are you guys doing like [ __ ] we should have sold probably if someone goes to clip. co it'll probably be different by the time this comes out but I'm like it works it's just we don't have like the entire front end or like the demand side of the business figured out and we're not nurturing leads we we had the demand and it was just like creating the good product and then we like stopped promoting it so like demand went down and it was it was all kind of confusing I guess figuring out the 16th month 16 month client like uh lifetime it's like how do you test that in like two months because we're trying to get out and do these shorts that are working right now that we don't know if they're going to like work forever we we think they will is there a way to test like maybe it's like referrals or something like that for like a proxy for who would stay a year and a half without waiting the actual year and a half a lot of our agencies that we run we constantly doing temperature checks just checking in with clients to see how we're doing and also if like they're thinking something um and just getting ahead of it you can extend not only could you extend the customer retention but they actually really appreciate you coming up and saying like go hey like I noticed you were silent when you saw this logo like is there something wrong and just really being attentive to their needs that stuff actually works and systematizing the whole thing so like how do you automate those emails so it comes out when thing when work is delivered or and that's where the the systems and the processes are really important um which I'm guessing you don't have like automated emails and NPS reports Greg we got nothing we're getting in there we're getting in there now we're starting to figure it out it's not a necessarily a product Market fit issue it's a processes issue right right we look at a normal company and it's like oh they're very Hands-On our company was like here's your editor you guys do whatever the hell you want we're going to check in when you cancel there there was nothing with the the little temperature checks you're talking about it's like that's like business 101 but we like just ignored it altogether so I think that would probably double um retention in itself so that's sort of what we're working on now we're kind of in that move right now that transition we're like kind of barbell things it's like we want to go pretty low-end with sort of a like a head hunter model of like a lot of people use our our worldclass animators for like shitty podcast Clips it's like you don't need the best animator in the world to do that so like we should be charging more because like if we're charging less like if we're charging five grand a month and someone's using the best animator for shitty podcast Clips that's a problem we're like not charging enough so we're getting to like hey just pay us once we're g to find you someone awesome and that like pays for us to keep hiring the best of the best to use on our own content and like maybe a 25 Grand a month or a 50 Grand a month or or maybe one day the Greg 100 Grand a month uh sort of package Dylan and I probably have to acknowledge as Founders is we'd rather not be the one to 100 guys and so I think what we need to do is like find that person because it's just not our strength so I think we should quadruple down on our strength not try and like fix this thing that we're not that great at which is even why I'm I'm bad at YouTube because I'm like we already cracked zero to one on YouTube like getting to 10 million subscribers is just like one to 100 with a business I'm like I don't want to do that um so then I I'm like [ __ ] oh the newsletter that's a cool thing to do I think our goal is just like build a good product that gets enough cash to like find that person that wants to take it one to 100 and they can sort of like figure out what the best product it's like writing a job description CEO of clip and and putting it out there and trying to get someone who's the best at that and just be like I'll give you 10% of the company or whatever let's go exactly that's pretty much where we're at and we're currently going to see how Henry's brother who's a couple years older than us but like actually gets growth in a company his startup sold to uh a big Bank like he has no desire to make content no desire to be the face of something Greg do you have any uh wise business wisdom like the um other stuff where you see us going wrong or normal first of all I'm impressed with you guys like that's why I wanted to chat with you guys um I I see you as like you're doing cool stuff and you're doing your own way you know like which is interesting like you're not just copying other people you've got a unique perspective so that's really cool if I were you I would just think about what are the individual business units I want to create with the one kpi just focus one one by one and I think acknowledge like you did the hard thing which is acknowledging that there's certain things that you're good at and certain things you're bad at I think being like real with yourself around like yeah I don't like cleaning the dishes but I I should be cleaning the dishes you know there's some things that like you just have to do and some things that you don't want to do so I think acknowledging that it will be important but also hiring out probably for clip I think having Henry's brother will be really important but I also think like you guys know the business you've dealt with clients understand how to create amazing animation anim and you've created clips for the world's biggest podcasts so obviously you know what you're doing you just have to you have to have a North star and in multi preneurship you have to have these like mini North Stars so that's all that's my biggest advice for you and honestly anyone listening anyone interested in like this sort of thing it's like you'd be surprised how simple the advice is and I like the like one kpi each so say it is the 16 or year and a half retention for clients I'm clipped and it's like just like just focus on making it the best experience and then yeah it reminds me of the Peter teal thing where it's like everyone has like one metric one metric that's the only thing you're focused on and like don't talk to me about anything else uh yeah I really like that before we head out who's one Creator or business person that you you're looking up to right now each of you the been talking Jeremy gfin a lot yeah bonus points for nonobvious people we're trying to get to like the first principles of inspiration and get to like the primary source which would be like a Warren Buffett a Charlie Munger so we're we're like always looking for the most timeless stuff our whole approach to content is like rather than compete like basically everyone's competing in the world of content and it's really freaking hard because you're competing if you just decide not to compete and be in this world of your own then there's no competition there cuz I'm really into like SEAL Teams and like military stuff there's this Sean Ryan Show podcast that I've been listening to a lot for military content there weren't many podcasts that were blowing up and like talking to operators as an operator and it's just like he owns that world and so anytime I'm thinking of something like oh what is the SEAL Teams like or what do the Army Rangers whatever it might be I just go to that but that's just with my own personal interest for every person in between Warren Buffett and Alex horos there's lot of information um and we want to be doing stuff that that was applicable a 100 years ago I was invited to a small Tony Robins event and so I went Don't Judge Me listener or you guys I was really impressed with how he like laid out his whole stage basically like I made that mental note I went home and it was the day that the Alex her MOSI like uh webinar was I watched the webinar and it was exactly the stage that Tony Robbins had the next day I went back to Tony I spoke to Tony's team and they're like yeah Alex is like a big fan of Tony Robbins just goes to show you that like everything is kind of like a remix of something someone else everyone has primary sources Etc I used to like put Casey net on the ultimate pedestal then I found found out Casey neistat's actually just a carbon copy of his brother van neistat who's just a cop carbon copy of the artist Tom Sachs who's probably a carbon copy of 10 other things and so that's when I I had the same kind of realization I think the only reason that like Dylan and I are kind of sitting here today is because of Naval rant right after college we were really lost we were both unemployed and we found Naval rant on Joe Rogan's podcast and like changed our entire life changed how we changed how we think about everything how we value our time how we value money um just as like a tech philosopher guy he kind of changed the course of our life I've been really into Palmer lucky and what he's doing and he was on invest like the best uh recently and he was talking about kind of what you're saying Greg of like looking at what's Timeless like old ideas he was saying how everyone right now we're just obsessed with like looking around us what other people are doing and copying us but like rarely do we look more than 10 years back and so everyone in VR was like competing like looking at what other people were doing in VR and it was all failing but he'd just go back and read like 60 years ago like the the ideas that they had around VR and he was noticing basically everyone was like there was just like one design that had like simple Optics but like it required a lot of compute and they just couldn't do it at the time so they just like discarded the idea and no one ever like went back to it but in the future like now people were like still using these super heavy Optics that they had to make up for having lack of compute back in the day they didn't realize we have the compute now so he just went back and like was able to basically reduce all of the weight that they had on their VR goggles and just simplify the actual um physical part of it and uh optically distort the images and stuff so it worked out I'm like way above my pay grade in terms of like the technical side but basically um same thing happens with anderl and his like military companies everyone's ignoring like what they were researching in the 60s just um applying those old ideas to current day we like now we have new technology but people still forget about all these like classified documents but returning to those with the modern uh technology Warren Buffett missed the internet like everyone's talking about AI like Warren Buffett just skipped the internet he got apple he got apple he got it late didn't he like he wasn't buying Apple in the seven you know in the 80s or something right I think it was like 20 18 or something 10 years after the iPhone eight years after the iPhone yeah yeah so it sounds like homework assignment is we got to find older texts to uh to read figure out all this stuff absolutely the out of stone of stone pavad Gita is that one boys this has been real bring I knew you'd bring it you said you'd bring Ruckus and you brought you brought some Ruckus we'll put the the links to your YouTubes especially Dylan's in the show notes subscribe Twitter help him out c l i PT .

picture this your young talented architect full of ambition working 70 hours a week trying to get to the next stage of your career after months of hard work you're finally promoted to your dream position you're earning good money you have a respectable position in your company and you even propose to your girlfriend Life's good or that's what you think a few months later your firm gets really hit by recession and you suddenly lose your job just like that in a blink of an eye everything you work so hard for gone and you can't even find a new job because no one's hiring in the middle of a recession sounds like a pretty awful scenario right okay now picture this what if I told you that only after a year of being laid off you made over $200,000 and started a business worth well over seven figures well that's exactly what happened to Pat Flynn from Smart passive income wondering how he bounce back from Rock botom watch until the end to find out the story is [Music] crazy there's this Common Thread that exists in the stories of today's most successful entrepreneurs it's called the ACP funnel which stands for audience community and product and Pat Flynn is no no exception to this this is how he utilized the ACP funnel to leverage the power of community and build his internet Empire let's break it down stage one audience so Pat had lost his job he worked so hard for and there were no job opportunities for him on the horizon but there were a couple of things that no one could ever take from him the Knowledge and Skills he learned over all these years so a few months ago Pat had created this website to help him and others pass the lead exam it's this professional certification in the architecture industry that he took in order to get that promotion Pat couldn't believe how many people were visiting this website thousands and people were saying I want to pay for this content and that's when the light Bob went off that there's a business opportunity here so he got to work and created an ebook study guide for the lead exam launching it in October 2008 by the end of that month Pat had sold 300 copies of that ebook earning a total of $7,950 yes in a single month literally double of what he made in his old job 6 months later his ebook has over $100,000 of sales and by the end of 2009 he had well over $200,000 of sales Pat learned the lessons of how to start an online business and he wanted to share this knowledge with the world so he started a new blog called smartpassiveincome.com Pat continually added more content to his blog as he ran different experiments and tried new things to make money online and over time smart passive started to gain a significant following P buil an audience that saw him is this reliable trustworthy Source in the online business education space pretty Niche but a high quality audience and things started to take off from there stage two Community a year and a half later Pat expanded his reach by starting a YouTube channel over time smart passive income became the reliable source for aspiring entrepreneurs looking for passive income because Pat was sharing all these Frameworks and stories and case studies and he wasn't just some expert starting in 2008 this guy was in the trenches he was selling hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars of EB ebook sales and this helped develop his personal brand every new business he undertook be it in security training clickable Maps or even food trucks became chapters in an ongoing narrative in smart passive income the last income report he had shared was in 2017 where he did a full breakdown of his monthly Revenue affiliate earnings $5,695 Book Sales $2,246 50 core sales $ 41,8 4998 Niche sites $3,866 196 podcast sponsorships $3,389 software and apps $1,581 74 pretty impressive right by sharing his knowledge and experience and teaching others how to build successful websites to earn passive income he became a recognized figure in the online business community and built a strong Community around him Pat started a movement which is key to any Community the best communities are movements remember that stage three product everyone wants passive income right Pat Drew from his own failures and successes to teach his audience how to build their own passive income his Niche had one particular goal generate passive income online and this Niche not only allowed him to launch successful podcasts and successful communities but also launch information products that could help his community achieve their goal over the years Pat has launched many community-powered courses and three best-selling books makes a ton of money as a high- paid speaker and is a massive super affiliate my guess is his net worth is anywhere between 7 and $10 million here's here's a breakdown of his revenue streams while these numbers are from a few years ago this gives us a ballpark of how each Revenue stream contributes to Pat's earnings and as you can see he's Diversified his income so if any one Revenue stream dries up he's safe and even today Pat's looking to expand Pat believes that his audience can benefit from these experiments and as he tries new things and follows his business curiosity he just reports his findings to his community smart passive income he doesn't consider himself an expert just an experimentor who learns through trial and error Pat emphasizes the power of continuous learning adaptation and sharing to provide value to his audience and that's the story of Pat Flynn and how he has used the ACP funnel a framework that's reshaping how we do business Pat's journey is a prime example of how online platforms can be leveraged to share knowledge build community and create sustainable income streams all while helping other people along the way win-win if you like this video check out the other videos I do on the ACP funnel where I go through some of the most successful internet Empires such as Ryan holiday Jack

the best way to be interesting on the Internet is to be going on a quest that is going to change you and that is worth following if you look back to the early days of convertkit when I started it I've live blogged the entire process of conver for the last uh 10 years the very first post was me planting a flag I didn't even know what I was doing at the time but I basically planted a flag and said this is the journey that I'm going on I'm going to build a SAS company to $5,000 a month in recurring R in six months with only $5,000 of my own money and I called it the web app challenge that is what ultimately became kver Nathan Barry the Creator Puppeteer in many ways just running things behind the scenes yeah thanks for having me on I was talking to some like a a group of authors and book publishers and like a bunch of like book industry insiders the other day and they were just talking about how I have probably access to more creators than like in the book space Maybe than anyone else I think that's true just from like who uses can B it well that's why I invited you you know I figured the person who is the center node to all these creators must have a lot of insight as to what's working for building audiences so that's one part of it and then what's working for monetizing those audiences I.E building Creator Le businesses are you down yeah let's do it across the entire Creator economy like let's distill it down to what is actually working for a lot of folks it's very overwhelming to go out there and create content and yeah put yourself out there either for yourself or as a brand and then it's really difficult to know there's a hundred ways to monetize you know do I build courses do I build coaching do I build SAS product do I build an agency let's start off by who comes top of mine in terms of audience building who's done a really good job non obvious non obvious yeah oh man well the hard thing is if you do audience building really well you become obvious right like that is by definition like people that you've had on before Nick Huber and others who have done uh audience building really well someone who I think is really interesting right now is CA kazinski who runs enduring Ventures there's sort of this Creator capitalist model that you see happen with people who are building funds and buying companies and all of that and Seeva has this fund where you know they've raised a good amount of capital and bought good cash flowing businesses and then he really has learned that if he has an audience then he gets access to a whole lot of deal flow um both for businesses to buy and then also more fundraising more Capital to use that to buy more businesses and so I don't know how much he's talked about it publicly but just from him and I talking like he's built a pretty massive newsletter on one scale right he's not the next James clear right but I think he's up over 30,000 subscribers you know from turning around a newsletter pretty quickly on a niche topic and so I I think what he's done is really interesting the other thing with it is that that audience is very very high value right you see people who are building even a smaller newsletter in a specific Niche and it can be really high value like I'd much rather take 30,000 people in interested in investing and buying businesses who are higher net worth people on that one side compared to like 300,000 who are reading a food blog and nothing against food blogs it's just like the intent or the amount of money that is expected to transact there is wildly different CA is really interesting because CA 128 months ago basically had no audience I've watched him grow to he must have over 100,000 followers now what I take away from his uh rise to fame so so to speak is he shares stories he basically goes through life and he writes down the stories that he sees so he's buying businesses and he'll be like I bought these businesses and here's what I learned and what I'm seeing right now in terms of audience building is there's a lot of folks who are basically copying other people's content on X sometimes that works but my thesis is that that's going to be less and less of a thing over time uh as AI helps automate a lot of that so the people that are going to win are going to be sharing unique perspectives and stories what are your thoughts on that there was a time on X that you could just copy and paste anything from Wikipedia and that would get traction so long as you drop some images in a smart way and had a decent hook especially with writing being done by AI right now A filter that I like to use is if I'm writing something could AI have written this if yes it's probably not worth me publishing if no all right what do I have here there's this guy years ago his name is kalis Ted and he founded a company called invado and they built marketplaces basically a big tech company out of Australia and he had this line that he said maybe 2010 that just stuck with me and he basically saidif you want to be interesting on the internet first be interesting off the internet and I think that's what is so interesting about Seeva compared to someone who is just you know copying content or theorizing on stuff C is like I bought this business here's what I learned here's where it worked here's where I went wrong here's my or here's my thesis on investing follow me as I actually put it into practice I think the best content comes from a story that only you can tell it's a unique point of view that you have someone else I love to follow is Dan runy who runs a Blog called trapal and he has this like deep inside look into the music business and so his newsletter is read by a lot of like top music Executives and that's who he's writing to like he's giving them the inside information right because the head of anr at some record label they still read content online just like the rest of us and so Dan is like hey I'm going to write just just for them and get those people on my list he just has such a unique perspective because of his background and everything in the music industry and he's writing content and similar to Sea that I don't think really many other people can write these are behind the scenes conversations and so if you actually come out and say Here's how the real world Works here's what I'm learning from it and let people in on that conversation then I think it's super fun and you end up with great growth a lot of people don't double down on content because they say well I don't have anything interesting to share it's actually inter because a lot of those people when you're like hey like tell me about what you did today and it's like oh I met this person who's like super interesting or uh you know I basically everyone is interesting yeah if you're on this planet and you're breathing you're interesting but what do you say to those people who might not be Nick Huber Sahel Bloom sea level who are very interesting um in the traditional sense what do you what do you say to the untraditional people well I think I'd probably disagree with your premise that everyone is interesting I I think that most people are actually really not interesting at all because they don't know like the fundamentals of a good story I was talking to a uh book publisher this is maybe four or five years ago right so he's an editor at a major publication we're talking about the difference between how fiction books work and non-fiction books so if we're writing a non-fiction book and we want the publisher to buy it I write a proposal table of contents and one chapter and I submit that fiction is a little different where fiction you have to write the entire book and then you shop it unless you have a track record you don't shop the book until it's done so I was talking to my friend of like wait so you're just getting entire manuscripts dropped on your on your desk non-stop like how do you are you reading all these books to find out if they're worth reading and like worth publishing or not and he's like no you don't have to read the entire book to know I only need to do two things I pick up the book and read it at the beginning for long enough to understand who's the hero of the story what describes their character like what are they struggling with any of those things and I go to the end and I read enough to try to understand are they the same person at the end as they were at the beginning and if they were the same I just put the book down like just toss it there's no point I know that the middle they did not go on a journey that changed them in any way and so it's not a story worth reading but if I can read the end and understand like okay this our the hero of our story has undergone some fundamental change you who they are what they're capable of or anything else then that points to like that the middle might be worth reading and so if you apply that to life in general I want to know what Journey are you on that is going to change you and I think most people are on the Journey of going to work and home again I'm happy for you if you're content with that right but like that is not an interesting story you are the hero of this journey what is what is the journey that you're going like who are you going to become on the other side of this what transformation are you going through a lot of people are going on these epic quests sea is going on this Epic Quest to build you know this multigenerational company he's thinking about business entirely differently he's constantly having to level himself up he's going through this massive transformation and he's letting us like follow along which is amazing someone's saying okay I want to be interesting on the internet I want to be followed on the internet so I have to be interesting well the best way to be interesting on the Internet is to be going on a quest that is going to change you and that is worth following if you look back to the early days of conver when I started it the first I've live blogged the entire process of conver for the last uh 10 years the very first post was me planting a flag I didn't even know what I was doing at the time but I basically planted a flag and said this is the journey that I'm going on I said I'm going to build a SAS company to $5,000 a month in recurring Revenue in six months with only $55,000 of my own money and I called the web app Challenge and that is what ultimately became convertkit I didn't hit any of my goals like it took way longer to take off than expected but like a bunch of people came in who said like oh this is a journey worth following and I will give you help and advice along the way because you seem to actually be going somewhere and so I just encourage more people building an audience be get very very clear on the journey you're going on and then just invite people along for that Journey my take is there's two types of potential creators one is just you're a non B2B Creator you're just a person who has a life and to me by being on this planet you have interesting things happen to you no matter who you are for example you know you witnessed 911 or you you felt what 911 was and you process what that is the issue is most people are not interesting storytellers to your point yep they don't know how to actually contextualize these things that happen in life uh even if it's as mundane as I'm really into Pokemon cards and they don't know how to put it into a story which is let me tell you about the time where I broke a pack of 1999 Pokemon cards and I got a Charizard I think everyone should be studying how to be a great Storyteller I think on the B2B side because we're talking about seas and Nick Hubers and stuff like that I think that you're right in the sense that not everyone who does do things professionally is doing something interesting professionally prompt for people is two things for for B2B it's how do you become interesting number one and then how do you become a interesting Storyteller number two I think also realizing going to your first point that there's not that big of a difference between the people we perceive is interesting and the ones that we perceive is not interesting if I'm a designer working at a software startup I go to work I come home I do my thing and that is not really interesting but if I give a quest in there right I am trying to level up my skills because I want to be a creative director and now I'm going out and I'm interviewing people and I am learning what I can do and I'm teaching the skills that I learned last week like there it's a very small difference between like showing up and doing my job and having a clear goal and getting to that point right let's say I want to get a job at Apple I can go through that in a very boring way moving through things gradually like and someday I'd love to get a job at Apple or I could tell a story of like I want to work at Apple one day and here's everything I'm doing here's how I'm learning like the connections I'm building all of that to be someone that Apple would be excited to hire who knows if that would actually work out but I know for a fact the more you can be clear on a goal and like relentlessly pursue it the more interesting it is or the other thing on the other side I think you could do is really focus on being a great Storyteller in the mundane because if you can take those mundane things and this is something that I don't think that I'm particularly good at at you follow someone's story like some random post on uh a blog or a newsletter or something else and you're like wow that was really powerful and special and like there's actually not that much to a story right it was just someone's interaction at a park that day but they told it in a certain way how compelling is the journey that you go are going on and how compelling are you at packaging and storytelling someone who is the best at both they're going to have a much easier time building an audience but you could be mediocrite storytelling and have a compelling Journey or you could have a mediocre journey be compelling at storytelling and either one of those will work as well what makes a successful story or package like how do you break that down well I think at its core you're trying to educate or entertain right that's all that we're doing as content creators there's some amount of education and some amount of entertainment some things are going to be very heavy on education here is exactly how to install Ruby unveils on your computer and then other things are going to be pure entertainment right comedy but then you again the best are the ones that weave both those through where like if you're taking comedy where you walk away with a different perspective like you laughed your way to a different perspective a content creator named Chase Reeves uh he did a bunch of stuff in the business space he knows business content really really well and now he has a YouTube channel reviewing bags so like backpacks laptop bags all of that like he could give you the mo most boring you know like talk about a bag and that would not do well but he is so entertaining because of who he is and how he is as a Storyteller and his comedic timing and everything else I would happily watch that guy tell me about a backpack any day and so he's like very much maximized entertainment you think of those two things and then what what skills you pick up it's really it's really the balance anything you're TR trying to teach the more you can add an entertainment value to it often the more people is going to reach they call it Ed educ now and I think especially as the younger you are the more you want bite-size entertainment like you want your education to feel like entertainment and you want your entertainment to feel like entertainment like what Ryan Reynolds did with mmobile where he has this whole string of commercials that he's starring in the production quality isn't crazy high you know it's often him in front of a green screen there's one where he they're talking about family plans and he's got uh his sister-in-law involved in the commercial and there's some good comedy in there and all that and obviously he's Ryan Reynolds and so partially it's entertaining because of that you know um the star value but I I haven't seen many Creator businesses try that style of commercial an example he did the early ads for square Adam Adam lore right he did that he did like square and Airbnb and it turned into this thing where he starred and you know 80% of the ads they were good but they weren't like entirely groundbreaking or they didn't have to have a huge budget or this star power but they were all just good and so people watched that and I often wonder if we could do a series of Creator style commercials like that I haven't figured out how it would work but I want to see more brands that have done that because I I feel like it's uh approachable because it's approachable but also because the platforms are prioritizing video creators are going to want to create more video brands are going to want to create more video products are going to want to create more video and the type of video people want is basically entertainment plus like very shot in an iPhone like even did you see uh the other day there was the Apple event and at the end of the Apple event which is like supposed to be this like super high produced event that cost millions of dollars to create it said shot on an iPhone 15 yeah and then they had the the behind the scenes content like showing some of how they actually shot it I mean it's fascinating there's almost a cool Factor to be like yep and I did this with the device that anybody has it used to be cool to say like oh I had this red camera or whatever the equivalent is in your industry right the absolute best of whatever and it's polished and perfect and now it's cool to be like yep I didn't do that I did it this other way we all have access to the same tools and I use them to produce something remarkable whereas you're over here complaining about I could create something great if only I had access to these other tools or budgets or something else that I don't have did you see Sean pu's application to the all-in podcast I did see it this is a perfect example it has well over a million views he basically shot it himself edited it on iMovie it's his job application to work at the all-in podcast and it's basically a two-minute clip kind of making fun of Jason Cal kenis jamath David Sachs fredberg little little punches at those people at the end he's like this isn't a a real job application and and it says like at Shan BP and he just controls the narrative from that so powerful probably took him a couple hours to do uh so I think we'll see more of that what are some brands that in the Creator space either individual creators or companies that you think would do a good job with this style of of content I actually think that everyone should be creating content like this if you create content and you want it to spread and you want to build Affinity then video is the best possible way to do it and I hate saying that because I hate being on video because like I'm on video and I'm like how do I look and you know did I say something wrong versus I can just go on Twitter and just like from the hip and just sort of write a oneliner Press tweet not think about it so much easier for me I was just thinking about as you're talking about like the shoot from the hip type thing or how you would build the habit or flywheel to make it that you could produce content at a consistent basis like if you wanted to get good at comedy but I'm trying to think about how you would get good at it right because you have to practice I guess if you forc yourself to do it every single day and you're like all right I'm G to try to write a funny little 30- second vignette about like this convertkit feature and it's like any other skill like if I'm complaining about like oh I don't know how to make a convert kit feature release video funny it's like well of course not you've never done it before but I if you have to do it every single day for 90 days in a row I bet some of them would actually be entertaining and you would get better at figuring out what worked people like Shan pory like he's a student of Comedy the guy is loves comedy I think he might even want to be a comedian when he quote unquote grows up and he's amazing at it so like for him to go and create that video like for him that was probably shooting from the head for someone like me or maybe you that is a bit more of a high barrier and the question becomes how do do you get normal people like us to the level of Shawn is there a way to accelerate that learning this is a little different but in the realm of public speaking that's a place that comedy matters a lot you're finding this balance between education and entertainment uh there's a guy named David Nill who uh he's this Irish guy lives in the Bay Area who hated public speaking forced himself to get into standup comedy in order to overcome his fear of it and now he like he's quite a good comedian if you look up his videos he's done really really well he did something a really interesting service one of these agencies that I think is just fascinating he said when I sit in an audience and I'm watching like a conference talk I hear a story right because everyone knows when you tell a you know give a conference talk you should tell stories your voice changes when you're telling the story you'll see the audience start to lean in they're like blah blah blah boring thing always telling a story then they lean in and pay attention so what David was saying is he notices the audience do that he's like as a comedian I can see where the joke is going and then like the speaker totally fails to land the joke he's like there was a great joke there like you could have done this punchline and so what he did is he got a bunch of his comedy friends together and said we're going to make an agency where we will punch up your business talks you bring a talk that you've already done and you send it to us and we will write it no more than 5% and we will make your talk funny and we will measure laughs per minute throughout your talk I'll give you an example the David and he watched one of my talks and he's like okay here's how to make it fun you for next time I was talking about the difference between when you're selling online versus selling in person and how if you if you sell online you don't get feedback but if I'm like hey Greg you buy this thing from me you have to respond you can't just be like uh no thanks and like you can't just leave whereas online you can hit the back button I never get feedback on why you why you didn't buy so the advice that David gave me is he's like you have to make that moment really awkward like play it up mind that you're talking to the person in the audience hey we you buy this thing and then just like mime you know holding the mic and turning away slowly and like as awkwardly as possible he's like count 10 your head and walk to the back of the stage where it's just like miming this awkward interaction sure enough like the more Awkward I made that and the longer I played it up with the audience it got a much better laugh and I've given that talk 10 times it gets a great laugh every single time I think it's fascinating how these small tweaks can make a big difference I think that's true for storytelling across the board should give to people because it's teachable you learned you basically had a before and after you know one of my favorite followers on on X is is Nikita beer whenever I see his tweet I'm always like we laughing uh it's just so so good there's usually like three different layers like you read it and you're like oh like that's funny and then you like realize that it's actually a reply as well to this other thing that's happening in the narrative and it's making fun of this other group entirely and you're like all right this is then you're just dying loud it's cool because you can actually like follow his account and be entertained and learn about consumer social apps and consumer Behavior so it's not like just all jokes and memes that sort of thing both him and Shan pory are people I look up to in terms of how do you inject comedy and your stories I think like storytelling in terms of sea style works a lot in terms of building audience Nikita style Shan porri uh comedy uh and punchiness also works if you can blend the two and then really realize that these are all skills that can be learned right like we wouldn't expect to sit down at the piano and be able to play something amazing if we've never played piano before you're like oh I'm I wrote this story and it's terrible Well yeah if you don't know how to write and you haven't studied that then of course it's going to be bad so like deliberately go and learn those skills the second thing is you can also hire these people I'm trying to do a talk and I go out and hire a speaking coach someone like David Nill who's f focused on Comedy or someone else like Mike pacon who is focused on the overall talk like he'll give me things it's not going to be funny in the moment but I gave a talk at craft and commerce my my conference talking about uh flywheels I have these visuals I'm explaining it and all of this and then it transitioned to the next thing and he's like I don't know that transition is weak just play it up and be like that's what we call a metaphor it gave just this little bit and it got a laugh from the audience every time a professional will come and be like yeah here's the joke and they'll make those tweaks and so in any of your content like deliberately learn and then go out and get the outside opinion to punch it up it probably cost a lot less than you think because you know comedians a lot of the time aren't you know making millions of dollars a year like I have a few comedian friends like they're some of my smartest friends even smarter than some of my tech friends because they're just so quick so witty they have this amazing ability to see the audience and they're able to just predict what's going to happen next and as a content creator that's what we need we need to be able to craft messages and content that uh is able to anticipate the needs of people and able to understand where their eyes are going to gloss over and where we need to insert a joke sometimes these wildly valuable skills are not actually well paid skills writing has been a terribly paid skill right if you were to go get a you know an English degree or something university' be like cool like I hope you enjoy working at Starbucks right that would be the the joke that people would make and probably comedy the same thing okay great how are you actually going to make money and now what we're finding online is that those are insanely valuable skills when applied correctly and if you came in and told me like hey I started doing this and then two years later I'm making a quarter million dollars a year with my audience of 50,000 people that I built I'd be like yeah naturally like that makes sense you know but other circles people be like wait what how are you as a right writer making $250,000 a year and it's just because comedy writing teaching all of these things are so so valuable at capturing attention and then you can drive that attention to whatever you want and you get leverage in a really interesting way the writer uh piece is really interesting like you used to get paid $50,000 to write and now the greatest writers Sahel blooms and the Nick Hubers are getting paid $5 million a year to to write think about it like this whole you know writers comedians School teachers like that is not a well-paid job and you have all of these School teachers who end up leaving and either teaching their field online or providing resources for other school teachers or whatever else they bring in these these elements of online business and audience and then turns out that is a wildly profitable job like I know a school teacher who makes almost a million dollars a year like teaching school teachers how how to manage their classroom how to show up effectively how to create lesson plans all of this stuff and he actually still teaches part-time at the high school that he originally taught at because he's like look I still want to be boots on the ground I still want to have this regular material and I love what I do I just didn't want to make 60 Grand a year anymore and so now I'm doing the online thing got an audience of 100,000 people uh I've got my email let dialed in and all of that and I can do the thing that I love and get paid absurdly well for it these previous the undervalued skills are now insanely valuable so once you've built up that audience let's let's uh move into the second section of this of this pod around monetization how do you think about coming up with business model ideas for creators and prioritizing the ones that make the most sense yeah I think you can end up in a place where there's so many opportunities that you could be paralyzed and not choose a good one or you end up not choosing any at all probably the first thing is choose something anything that works and you'll iterate from there a lot of people start with ads paid newsletter or an ebook there's a bunch of skills that you have to learn in order to make money on the internet right how to write a headline how to sell a product how to create a landing page process payments if someone was like wait how do I process payments on the internet if we were starting from scratch today like that's a question you have to figure out and understand same way that if you were trying to set up an LLC right if you you'd be like a registered agent what is that that sounds so official that's just a form on the you know like that's actually a really basic thing so I have an essay called the ladders of wealth creation where I talk about the skills that you need to learn to move up and basically gain leverage uh with each ladder I think it's important to be deliberate about the skills you're learning and where you're going to go from there and then probably just expose yourself to a lot of different methods of monetization and look both in your industry and then across Industries when I was doing design full-time instead of going to like the CSS G Gallery website cuz that would result in me just creating the same stuff that everyone else was creating I liked to go to other Industries entirely and try to borrow from them so one of my favorites was actually fashion and not like high-end fashion like you know Armani or something like that but even just looking at like Banana Republic as they put out their fall collection what colors are they using you know what textures on the clothing tags you know any of those things and I'd get really great web design inspiration like I would shamelessly copy some of their color palettes or some of you know font choices or that sort of thing and bring it to an entirely different industry belt new and novel it's the same thing when you're looking at pricing or monetization like pay attention to how are people doing it in your Niche but then also go to an entirely different Niche right we've referenced Nick Huber he can make plenty of money off of sponsorships and digital product sales and traditional things but he's actually making the like the bulk of his money off of two agencies with Shepard and his re cost EG Ryan holiday makes an absurd amount of money selling coins that have stoic phrases on them I'm involved in this ghost town in California with Ryan holiday and Brent Underwood and a few other people and that has layers of monetization to it people visit there's some money to be made with tours it has a YouTube channel it makes like 50 Grand a month in sponsorship Revenue because the YouTube channel is so popular there's merch right that's expected so this ghost town has actually like a fantastic Revenue line which all get spent to run the ghost town because turns out it's expensive to do but then if you go from there you're like wait there's actually like TV and movie commercial uh or like product commercial licensing and location fees here and then you could also take that brand and you could turn that into you create sordo whiskey right or something else there's often another business model that is much higher Ry that's possible and you just have to kind of Branch out to see it you need to ask yourself where do I want to start once you have an audience there's like a hundred ways you can skin the cad in terms of monetization so so do you want something that's low ticket or high ticket you mentioned ads you can just plug in ads to get going um low ticket would be an example of an ebook or a course High ticket might be or medium ticket might be something like a SAS software subscription High ticket might be something like a mastermind or high-end agency type thing what does this look like when it scales for example if I were going to start an agency doing a logo design let's say logo design for high-end clients like Coca-Cola what does this look like when it scales or if I'm Ryan holiday he's got a pretty sweet gig because he he creates some coins and then he sells the coins I think the mistake a lot of creators are making in terms of starting these agencies is scaling a it's very easy to start an agency it's very hard to scale an agency and also quality between clients is very hard to predict in some service offerings so what you don't want to have is you don't want to be a Creator Who has 100,000 subscribers and then you sell 20,000 people on the service and they get different coins so to speak so my thesis is that you're actually going to see a bunch of Creator Le producti agencies die in about 18 to 24 months whereas I think the winners um are going to create smaller agencies or um they're going to create a build once sell twice course type thing or they're going to create like a Ryan holiday type thing that has quality control what what's your thoughts on that everything sounds easier when someone talks about on a podcast that it actually is in real life I like that you're bringing up like hey this whole running an agency thing is actually kind of hard or you get into something where it's like it's simple but not easy have good deal flow to get clients provide those clients it's a great experience they'll tell more people book more clients right it's pretty simple model but then you get into it and you find like oh everyone has slightly different goals as much as you try to productize it and then you're having to fire clients who you hoped were a good fit but ultimately aren't because they want something that's like 20% different than what you're offering and you know or you don't fire them and you end up then your your agency like gets spread so thin trying to do all this custom work for everybody or for example it's just natural Growing Pains like your team is based in North America and you design a logo for someone in Tokyo and what is amazing in American culture doesn't translate well to Japanese culture for example you're going to see a lot of that I think you're also going to see a lot of people who don't understand how to run agencies who are starting them because it's easy to start a business and it's really hard to run a business in year three and and Beyond um and that's really when all the compounding starts to kick in I don't know it's something with the agency business model in particular I think it's a we we'll see the same drop off in all forms of monetization right someone launches a paid newsletter and then they realize like oh I may be a good writer but I'm not a prolific writer and turns out I chose a business model that requires my best content to be behind a pay wall and then I need new content not behind a pay wall to get new readers and like these two sides of my business are directly odds you know growth and monetization are directly in conflict or like my favorite writer you know runs a great paid newsletter let me copy their model oh turns out they've been a professional journalist for the last 20 years you know they're like wait I only have to write one piece today this is amazing whereas I'm over here being like I can't even get out of a single newsletter a week alone five days a week so I think you're gonna have the whole range of people finding out like this is actually really hard it's hard to stay consistent it's hard to work at it long enough for the compounded to kick in this requires like a different set of skills than what I have sometimes there's a very natural thing to sell to your audience where you're like oh this is easy so I'm going to do it it doesn't actually match your skills or you don't staff the team accordingly you see this a lot with celebrity products someone sees hey George Clooney and The Rock were both wildly successful with Tequilas I'm going to start with tequila as well why not I'm as famous as they are so they think like okay we'll just find something to White Label we'll do some splashy ad campaigns we'll throw some money at it and that should take off and we've already seen a bunch of those fail you're going to see way more of them fail because people don't understand that demand and the attention is only one part of it it actually takes an insane amount of work to run a successful business even if you've got the top of the funnel figured out if you were me and you've got an audience of 500,000 followers across platforms 75,000 newsletter subscribers I I just moved to convert kit last week uh shout out all right I monetized currently via we've got some agency businesses we have an innovation agency that works with sort of Fortune 500s on on designing their new future uh future we've got an SEO agency we've built some propietary AI software that allows us to get really good search results so we sell that as a service called boring marketing.com we've got uh design agency as a service focus on uh communitybased uh products and companies that's called meet dispatch.com um we've got communities that we run you probably need a robot.com for example which is an AI community so I'm monetizing via Services um and internet communities internet communities is more like digital assets that we sell what would you do if you were me to give people to have the examples EXA examples exactly one you have a lot of great ways to monetize right now there's this idea that I've talked about of strip malls versus skyscrapers and I think a lot of creators like to build strip malls here's what I mean if you think about the footprint of land what you can build right you're you're going to a strip mall and you're like okay I'm going to build this one little business here here's my Radio Shack and it's gonna have a Subway right next to it and we're just expanding horizontally across and if I get enough revenue from all of that I've got a great business right I'm well Diversified My Philosophy has much more been the skyscraper approach I'm going to take all of those same pieces and I'm going to build it into one thing and I'm going to build that as tall and successful as possible when you're looking across the landscape of businesses that you have bunch of small to medium businesses I would look is there one of those that you could build into a skyscraper that you could put a ton of effort into and this could be the next thing okay the SEO industry is actually pretty big software for SEO is is a big Market the multiples on software companies comp right now are really really good as well they're down from what they were you know two years ago but they're still valued you know recurring revenue is valued very very highly and so I'm like okay what has to be true for that agency that has software in the back end for us to start selling that software what if the high-end is the done for you and it's like many thousands of dollars a month and then like can I get the software company to the point where it's doing 10 million a year in subscription Revenue by itself a software company doing 10 million a year in revenue is worth more than $50 million right if it's growing growing well so I always look at how can I go from a strip mall to a skyscraper we had an offsite recently in in Charlotte with the boring marketing.com team the SEO team and um it's going really well so there's obviously the inclination to be like oh we should incubate this or we should like buy this company but the CEO of the business was a skyscraper guy and he was just like guys sem Rush is like a publicly traded company you can see their numbers like we've got this incredible software we need to create we need a double down on creating this incredible software we can unbundle the software and make it a SAS product um sell that and like the Enterprise Value will be in the in the software um so we we'll just sort of reinvest a lot of the cash flow to the software side of the business yes we can go incubate other things but why would we do that if we know that this opportunity is so large yeah and I think the blend between agencies and software can be really really interesting like some a lot of people have failed in that space before where an agency has tried to go out and search for a problem to make software around often the hard thing is software is great at long-term Enterprise Value and terrible for a short-term cash flow and so the agency kind of bridges that Gap the other thing is that often early software is just a pain to use so you can say like okay our agency will use it for you uh Brendan dun is a Creator who's very very good at email personalization and segmentation and he has this product called WR message which I'm an investor in he would get customers for the software they wouldn't be successful and they'd cancel their account which was not the fault of the software right it just turns out people didn't want to do the work to set it up and so finally he had people saying like we will pay you to do all this for us he's like no we run a software company not an agency and eventually like in the last six months he switched and said like okay I started an agency it's called slice and dice and it's all about segmentation personalization and we will do all of it for you right and we will use our software to do it because we have the best software platform for this and so now he's running these launches and building amazing funnels for all these top creators he's applying these principles they're paying a bunch of money up front and then they end up paying you know $250 to $500 a month longterm for the software so he's basically ensuring that every customer is like the perfect user of the software which no amount of like onboarding and help tutorials will ever turn someone into perfect user but when you're like all right fine I'll like pay me and I will just set it all up for you uh turns out that works pretty well he's getting the cash flow that he can use to build out all the features that he wants uh and he's getting all these Flagship you know customers that are saying like I'm getting these insane results like I here's how my funnel was converting before and then brenon and his team rebuilt it and now it's getting more results and so it's a great case study and so I think the blend between software and agencies is really really interesting if done well this conversation was everything I dreamed of and more with the with the Creator architect himself Nathan Barry and I will say I'm looking forward to using kkit I'm not being paid to to to to say this I'm a I'm a paying customer of convert kid uh I watched the episode that you did with Nick Huber where at the end you guys were diving into Nick's conver account and you were like riffing on messaging and and all of that yeah another vote for like the power of content right you can throw something out there of like I don't know conver should message things like this and then you can get the conver it marketing toam be like interesting you know like you can just incept ideas into people's minds by putting it out there the interesting thing about that conversation is I began that conversation on in the Beehive camp and I sort of was like okay like I show me where I canver kit did my research played around with it liked what I saw and I changed my decis convert kit made more sense for me because I'm looking for like segmentation yeah um and some landing page stuff um so anyways I'm excited to play around with it um if you're listening to this and you haven't subscribed to my new convert kit my newsletter Greg Eisenberg uh my name g r e g i s n bg.com yeah sign up and get that weekly dose of inspiration Nathan where you want to send people to learn more about you and convertkit convert kit.com to check it out you know it's free to use up to 1 th000 subscribers and then goes from there uh also if you check out the Creator Network just Creator network.com which is a convertkit feature but that drives a ton of growth for people and then my newsletter just Nathan Barry and Barry's b a r y.com and I write a newsletter every Tuesday about whatever I'm thinking about in the Creator economy now I'm going to describe myself as the architect to the Creator economy is that too pretentious no no I mean it's I called you said it first if you called yourself that I think that would be a problem but I do like I do like that you still write a newsletter it's kind of like that teacher you're talking about like still he's still showing up in class yeah I like that that's cool yeah you gota use your own products right work it's a big business and so I like that that you can you know you could be on a beach somewhere but you're wri in newsletters I love it thanks for having me on this has been fun anytime

Title: Why You Should Start An Agency In 2024
Published: 2023-11-14 13:00:38 UTC
Description:
Starting an agency is becoming an increasingly popular choice for entrepreneurs.

The capital-light nature of agencies means significantly lower investments, less risk, and fewer requirements to operate and grow the business.

But there's a fascinating shift on the horizon — the cost of creating a tech product might soon match that of starting an agency, becoming another viable option for entrepreneurs looking for a more strategic approach.

hey everyone welcome back to the channnel in today's video we're going to dive into the story of Colin and Samir from the Colin and Samir show and the exact strategy they Ed to capture an audience of millions build a loyal community and create a million dooll product let's get to it stage one audience so Colin and samir's journey began in 2011 in the comment section they both had their individual lacrosse YouTube channels at the time and after Samir left a simple hey love this want to connect on one of Colin's videos a partnership was born leading to the creation of the Lacrosse Network a few years later they sold the business to a company called Whistle a small exit which basically got them full-time jobs at this company But as time passed the duo realized they wanted to go back to their original documentary fre sty roots and tell stories they were passionate about that led to the creation of their second Channel Colin and Samir with this channel they focused on interviewing top creators dissecting the business of content creation which no one else was doing at the time now Colin and samir's YouTube channel has well over a million subs and their strategy to build the audience was actually pretty straightforward consistently producing unique high quality content that people could wouldn't get anywhere else they started off with case studies breaking down the strategies and stories of top creators without even interacting with them meaning their entire business was permissionless at the start over time the quality of their content and dedication led to interviewing big names like Mr Beast and Tim Ferris this further established them as the go-to resource for the business of creators so obviously a bunch of creators started following them and that's how they built one of the biggest audiences for creators on the internet stage two Community as Their audience kept growing Colin and Samir incentivized social media interactions they did this by launching a Discord community and hosted Live Events within the community giving their followers a chance to engage with them and basically hang out to further that sense of belonging they release Creator oriented merchandise which already is a product but for them it wasn't about the revenue the gear was basically to give their audience of fellow creators a stronger sense of identity so Colin and samir's Community quickly became the space for creators to come together chat and engage this gave them a firsthand look to all the problems that their Community faced stage three the product the insights that they got from their Community allowed them to offer new products that were so relevant to Their audience for example their first course YouTube storytelling where they test their proven method to find your audience and create videos that resonate but that wasn't the end of it Colin and Samir identified a massive Gap in the market so in 2021 they launched the publish press a free newsletter for creators that covers the latest developments in the Creator economy so if you were a Creator you wanted to be on this newsletter and all of a sudden the newsletter got more than 100,000 subscribers to be honest I wouldn't be surprised if they get to a million within the next 18 months and with such a big subscriber base in a niche audience there's a million ways that you can monetize this newsletter just so you get the idea the hustle which is another newsletter focused on business news sold for more than $20 million at 5 million subscribers it's not crazy that Colin and Tamir can hit that number and get a 20 30 40 million deal for the published press alone not a bad deal at all if you ask me Colin and samir's story which literally started in the YouTube comments of a small lacrosse channel is now on its way to becoming a multi-million dollar business this is a testament to the ACP funnel finding an audience building a community and creating a product that can solve a real need for that Community their commitment to Quality community building and responding to the audience's needs has been instrumental to their success one of my main takeaways from Colin and samir's rise in the Creator economy is the importance of defining and understanding your Audience by doing so they didn't just Chase Trends they created them they aligned both their content and products with this goal establishing themselves as the go-to place or creators so that's a wrap for today's video if you found this at all valuable and want me to tear down more Community Bas businesses hit the like And subscribe so I know you like these videos and if you want to build your own ACP funnel check out Community Empire linked in the comments below it includes two courses with the blueprint to build your own Community Empire a monthly email with two to three niches worth building businesses in a free school subscription which is a community platform I love and much more I

we pioneered something called a visual newsletter you get bullet points on news stories but it also comes with Graphics charts visuals around a story Etc it launched in February of 2023 by may we had 20,000 subscribers today it has over 260,000 subscribers two people with no employees scaled it all the way up the whole goal here is can we get to a million in Revenue per employee 2 million 5 million 10 million in Revenue per employee it's good to see you Anthony pum pomp Leana I want to start with what's one thing you believe that if you said out loud you would get cancelled for Content I host dinners with my wife if you come to one you will receive a list of all the people coming you'll get a link to who they are so you can do your stalking and research make it super easy to do stalking and research on top of that I propose a couple of questions but my go-to favorite is this one it tells you what they think is controversial one of the aspects that I find most interesting is someone will say something and everyone else at the table will say yeah that makes sense I agree things people think are un popular to say in public many more people agree with you then you realize and so by voicing it sometimes that actually elicits the positive response and then you realize hey this is a hell of you help by many people so an easy one is climate change it is obvious temperatures are changing things are in some cases getting better in some cases is getting worse but the evidence of human driven change is not nearly as compelling as many people think so it's easy to say things are changing humans are on the earth so it must be humans but when you go and talk to a number of these climate scientists probe into why exactly is it changing like explicitly is that human driven or not the evidence is not compelling yet I say yet because we may have a study that comes out and all of a sudden it's like bam this is exactly what it is also think of this if you take all the cars off the road or if you were to prevent all the cows from forting would the climate stop changing is it enough to reverse the trend I don't think that we have compelling evidence yet I'll try to get canceled with you right here just piggy back backing off that I was in Montreal and Montreal you go to the grocery store and you have to bring your own bag I bought a ton of stuff and didn't realize that I had to bring my own bag and I asked the cashier why do I need to bring my own bag and they go um well we don't want to hurt the environment which I understand but the question is plastic bags how much is that really impacting climate change the thing with data and the scientific studies is it depends who you ask one of the skill sets I think is going to become incredibly important in society over the next I don't know 10 20 30 40 50 years is can you critically think and have independent thought those two things are related many people say oh critical think is important is because they're worried about Ai and fake content all that but if you look at public narratives and go and read Source material and actually do some of the work yourself you start to understand there is a disconnect between some of that Source material and public narrative so you also have to be careful sometimes it doesn't matter what the truth is the public narrative is actually the thing that prevails I'll give you a great example financial markets show this all the time a company can be bad not worth buying but the public narrative is that the company is great and so for long periods of time the stock price can go up if you find a company and you're like this company sucks everyone else thinks it's amazing I'm going to short it at $20 a share well if it rips to a 100 you're going to lose money you're short and yes maybe eventually you are correct and the company goes to zero but the public narrative was more important in the run from $20 to 100 than actually quote unquote truth if you want to understand the minutia the details the Nuance you also have to understand does the minutia actually matter in terms of making money sometimes those two things are billin sometimes they're in direct opposition and that's what makes investing so hard you're canceled by the way I'm cancelled I tweeted something that went viral that's kind of related to this I want to get your perspective on if it's true or not the thing I said was we're in a newsletter bubble we are in a newsletter bubble for commodity content we are in a scarcity in a unique content vertical I'll give you two examples we do not need another uh political news hey here's what happened just the regurgitation of the events right in a newsletter there's tons of them they're actually competing so aggressively with each other that has become a commodity there is however room for a newsletter about politics from a very specific point of view that is not being shared in the mainstream media I know of an individual Marty bent he has a newsletter called Truth for the commoner he writes about Bitcoin r about financial markets but he also talks about politics that is a unique view on news that is being shared elsewhere in in aonez way from that perspective let's say he was only writing about politics and you said okay I can go to Politico I can see what they're writing I can go to five other political newsletters the other five newsletters in politics are going to overlap with politico's coverage because they're regurgitating what's happening Truth for the commoner is going have a unique view cut through the noise it will not be for everyone so a lot of times when I evaluate content newsletters media properties I ask myself is this content going to repel some large portion of people because if it is going to repel some large portion of people it will attract another large portion of people and so it's an edge it's an opinion it's a it's a perspective where I think that you're correct this over supply of newsletters just regurgitating the same content yeah that's not going to work in my opinion and they're acquiring users all the same way using conver bird kid or beehive boosts or meta ads and competing against each other and I'm curious in terms of paid email subscribers are they just as good as organic not as good as organic the acquisition method doesn't matter nearly as much as the quality of the content we have Bay Area times it is a newsletter focused on business Tech and finance we pioneered something called a visual newsletter you get bullet points on news stories but it also comes with uh specific visuals be Graphics charts visuals around a story Etc and so it helps you retain the information and frankly people don't want to read a lot they would rather just view pictures right it's why children like picture books uh same thing here um and so we have been able to grow very quickly it launched in February of 2023 by may we had 20,000 subscribers today it has over 260,000 subscribers so 12x growth in four or five months that growth has come from organic that has come from referral that has come from Paid Etc so a bunch of different acquisition channels at the end of the day if you have a product that people want they're going to open the email if you have a shitty product nobody wants they're not going to open it there's been so much focus and optimization in media around acquisition of audience that people forget if you want that engaged audience a year from now you got to have the right product the right quality if people do that I don't think it really matters where they find the user this leads me to another one of my spicy takes which is open rate doesn't matter to me open rate is like when you think of valuing a company open rate is revenue I don't care what your open rate is I care about clicks perent because that shows me how engaged it is what do you think about that it depends on what your business model is email specifically if you are doing brand awareness ad campaigns that's your model for monetization you don't need anyone to click all you need is be able to open and look at the ad it is increasingly harder to do that as advertisers get more data driven and direct resp response oriented if you have direct response advertisers then you absolutely need clicks the whole point is how do you drive the ROI a lot of people talk about founder market fit or product Market fit I think about content Advertiser fit and audience Advertiser fit if you look at Bay Area times or any of our other media properties we turn away advertisers all the time I sent an email this morning somebody want to offers a ton of money for our media property as an Advertiser and I just said to him look I don't think this is going to convert it's more important to build a long-term relationship with the right people and for words spread throughout an industry that every time I advertise in that specific newsletter it works that is way more valuable to me than a single ad campaign that might be worth you know 10 $20,000 and so I think it's it's really just asking yourself based on content audience and the business model I'm pursuing what is my metric who's the best in the game I don't know maybe a Gora like they didn't even care about clicks right what do they care about they care about like conversion at the e-commerce point of contact right like digipay and so for them they don't care about opens they actually don't even care about the clicks all they care about is we send an email how much revenue do we drive per email how many people convert as a paying subscriber each one's different maybe a macro point that you're making is just like it's not one siiz fits all and people want it to be that way you have to really understand this game if you want to build something defensible and that can scale because otherwise you know if you just want to make $100,000 with an email you can do that for sure but I think that is becoming less interesting to folks as everyone's ambition increases they see what is possible uh with this delivery Channel and they want to go build bigger business 10 years ago we would have thought oh come on newsletter like that's that's dying or you can't build a big business on top of it but we were wrong every business is a newsletter business basically look every business is definitely a marketing business r or sales business the first email effort that I ever did was in 2018 like five and a half years now um that I've been doing doing it and I've evolved we have direct paid emails substack I've been writing that literally since early 2018 to now we have platforms on email that are just advertising there is no subscription there is no anything else people are monetizing media we have media businesses that pay based on subscribers media businesses that do advertising we have media businesses that the bulk of Revenue comes from events we have media businesses saying hey I'm going to do media and then I'm going to sell my own products through the distribution there's a article that came out in the financial times yesterday that is now talking about a media company that is going to monetize with a hedge fund behind it and so the reporters are going to go do primary research and investigative reporting they are going to write a report they're going to show it to the hedge fund the hedge fund is going to buy positions and then they are going to publish the report so it's almost the inverse of what short sellers have been doing and now they're going to be long Sellers and so when you think about this you're like okay again there's a lot lot of legal Nuance in there how are they going to recruit journalists to do this type of work like there's a lot of questions but it's very obvious people are saying okay there's a tension in media how do we monetize it people are going to continue to experiment with a whole bunch of different methods five years from now we're going to be like okay here's the ones that worked here's the ones that didn't everyone's going to go run out and pursue the ones that work Bay Area time specifically did you have the idea for the visual newsletter first and then you were like how do I apply that to Tech business news this was not my idea somebody else was like Hey I've started this newsletter they actually reached out to my wife Paulina uh to interview her she sent it to me and was like this is pretty high quality as soon as I saw the first issue I was like this is a grand slam as long as it's scales and scale means you got to do it every day we're going to be in your inbox every morning got to keep the quality you got to figure out how to begin to monetize it stay disciplined and do those things over and over again for years without losing enthusiasm I reached out out to him I was like look I think this could be very valuable I think that there's a specific path here you write it every day we can do everything else he said let me think about it he he was not just like let me jump in and have a partner which is like a green flag from a partnership perspective if he would have been like yeah let's go today I'm ready to me I would look at that as a pink flag let's call it yeah on one hand I'm like hey let's get going we're losing days on the other hand the longer you play this game the more you realize that uh you only want to have Partnerships with people who actually want to be in the partnership I can be pretty compelling I've been doing this a long time I'm persuasive but if your heart's not really in it let's figure that out now versus six months from now when you're like ah the persuasiveness has weared off now we're in the grind of the day-to-day why did I do this well like we just wasted six months and it's not going to end up working I want to find long-term Partners in these businesses and make sure that we're both double opting in kind of like marriage right like till death do us part uh in sickness or in health like we're in this together and so what you end up finding uh with B area times it was just me and him from February until two weeks ago there was no employees there was no anything there's not very many people who have had any degree of success that are still willing to do something like that our partner in Bay Area times has also had success before right he he's the founder of our company it it's a known company in his industry like it's pretty legit and uh he writes the email every single day personally right and so two people with no employees scaled it all the way up and then we went and we've hired the first salesperson after almost a year of just us two with no employees doing this now we know this works let's go scale everyone wants it to be successful immediately and we didn't see subscribers growing very quickly and and figured out stuff there but we were very slow to add expenses we knew to optimize for long-term success not just short-term grab as much money as we can and then all of a sudden you know it blops and uh ends up being worthless like it very much can we build a news outlet that ends up being unique and has great resilience to it because that's really where the bulk of the value will end up being well yeah I'd make the argument that if it is unique it will be resilient I remember seeing Bar times a few months ago and being like okay yeah I see this working I also think the name itself Bara at times like I was like whoa was this created in 2023 or 1923 the the two questions everyone has is one was it created and is this like a small paper in the Bay Area or is this just leveraging Bay Area there's a bunch of tick uh tricks and t uh tips or hacks or whatever that probably will lend itself to a higher uh degree of success but then sometimes you just get the ingredients right if you're cooking like you have a recipe you did a tablespoon maybe tablespoon and a half it tastes good right who cares walk me through how you want to scale bar at times it has a quarter of a million Subs I know you're thinking big walk me through where you want to take it I try not to be super prescriptive about the long term I know that news specifically around business Tech and finance is ready for a new property that is able to deliver on two things one is visual content and two is a perspective on the world that Tech and business is good and not spend our time kind of attacking these industries what is beautiful about how we built this is we have deliverability we have direct relationship with these individuals take the pomp letter uh which is the subsect that I write I mean it's getting six figures of readers every day on any given day that's probably the number one article on a CNBC or a Bloomberg website Barry at times is very quickly going to become bigger than the pomp letter and so as that scales then it just comes down to how do you want to monetize it and so again there's ads there's subscription there's events there's uh all sorts of stuff around data Etc in the first 12 to 24 months all we try to do is launch nail the operations and become profitable what that exactly entails we don't even know yet we only have ads we have one ad slot in every email like we haven't optimized this at all but guess what we sell out all the ads right we've got revenue and we're able to say okay we've earned the right to think about stage two of this business the the beauty of media is it's very similar to software software is words in a database that you sell over and over again media is words in a database that you have to write every day but it only takes usually one or two people to write those words over and over and over again BuzzFeed has over, employees they do $400 million in revenue and the company's worth $50 million in the public market it's crazy Vice has I think 3,000 or 4,000 employees what are these people doing right you're telling me you got $400 million in Revenue a buzzfeed you probably could fire two-thirds of the staff now again it's horrible I don't want people to lose their jobs but how do you optimize the business you could cut cost significantly keep 70 80% of the revenue make it a profitable thing the question is are the businesses that already got really big able to do that or do you need the upstarts the people to come along and say hey actually we're not going to get big in terms of headcount the whole goal here is can we get to a million in Revenue per employee to 2 million 5 million 10 million in Revenue per employee you know uh if you think about the most profitable Media company on a per headcount basis in the world it's Joe Rogan's podcast two employees right I thought you were gonna say Warren Buffett yeah Warren Buffett is the influencer Warren Buffett created the Creator economy everyone gets mad when I say that on Wall Street but the guy is 100% a financial influencer you have the pom's letter he has the Warren Buffett's letter same thing listen the guy throws a financial conference every single year and people literally take like the financial Mecca trip to Omaha and they sit there and he basically hosts a live podcast he's an amazing investor but Warren Buffett would not be Warren Buffett without all of the influential components of media and interviews Joe Rogan's got two employees himself and one other person and they have a $100 million deal with Spotify they do $50 million per employee we are entering a world where there are going to be businesses with very small teams that have significant Revenue you segwayed into this brilliantly so here's my spicy take from this tweet I said solo preneurs equals solo burnouts think you're a one manwoman Army cool give it a year you'll be so fried you'll hire a team just to get a day off many solopreneurs will hire teams and be even more profitable and be happier than being a solo operator think software employees Capital these are all leverage points for an entrepreneur when it comes to entrepreneur ship you can definitely have an advantage in terms of less employees but I don't think that we are going to see very many oneperson companies reach significant scale measured in nine figures of Revenue the world likes black and white it likes the extremes but maybe the common format is going to be great entrepreneur small team big revenue is there a difference between one employee and five employees not really but there's a huge difference between five employees and 500 employees the solo preneur they're like okay I just don't want a big team I want a big Revenue which is much more feasible then I'm literally going to do it exclusively myself my point on solopreneurship is you don't want to be the single point of failure it's one of those romantic ideas Escape your 9 to-5 and be a solo preneur and make millions of dollars a year but the reality is it's about making some million dollars a year of Revenue to hire yourself out of rols to create Le there are a ton of people who operate one person businesses Lawn Care writing on the Internet or anything in between that make 500,000 a million if you want to make more you got to get some sort of Leverage what ends up occurring is a lot of people saw oh I can make money doing this and they ran 100 miles an hour but the person who's able to do 80 90% of financial performance in terms of profit but do it for 20 years going to make way more money so it go back to like what do you want to do and and by the way some people are literally I don't care how much money I make I just want to work by myself and not have to interact with people then great go do that but I think there's a lot of people who are playing the game of business who are saying Hey I want to make as much profit as I can while also enjoying the freedoms of owning my own business and those people are definitely going to have a team so who are you looking up to these days in the high leverage High Revenue world I don't really look up to anyone in that world the people I spend the most time studying are like the goats of of uh you know last 50 years who did it in the Legacy world what lessons can I learn from the deal they did the strategies they pursued Etc and then how do I morph those for the modern world look at Rupert Murdoch built a massive Business News Corp if you are in the media world and you don't understand how News Corp works if you don't know the story of how Rupert was able to go from basically owning a newspaper in Australia to literally owning Fox News like go study right you haven't done the work yet to really understand how that game got played and so the way he did it is not the way to do it today but a lot of the lessons a lot of the insights he had can be applied today for example when he went and acquired some of these uh less journalistic Publications that were more like the Tabloid type stuff he understood eyeballs pay the bills he understood where the eyeballs were doesn't mean that you or I or anyone else should go out and buy tapids but you know it' be really simple takeaway where are the eyeball today and maybe you should go try to either build or buy those types of properties too many people they're a student of now and you can learn of a hell lot by going back and looking at people over time it's so much lazier to copy people who are doing it now the takeaway for me from the Tabloid is like where is mispriced eyeballs and where is cheap eyeballs I can take that and within the context of email newsletters within the context of X within the context of in where are these mispriced eyeballs and then how can I put together a deal that allows me to buy some of these businesses yeah and understanding where the similarities and the differences are right rubert Murdoch rolled up a bunch of media properties in News Corp he also then tried to start a number of companies within similar verticals or kind of tangental they started book publishing like all this stuff entrepreneurship is the same thing like you're playing a sport and you can either be a professional or you can be an amateur an AM get rolled did you put the work in to actually understand how to win this game I remember sitting down with Anthony scaramucci this's actually a a point in my where I was like wow I went to go talk to him for the podcast got my two little microphones we're gonna do this whole thing he was not into Bitcoin but the man gave me a lecture quality breakdown of the history of currencies you think that guy's going to figure out how to invest Capital right of course he is when you start to look at some of this stuff you realize it's still hard even if you have the background you've done all the studying whatever but man do you have a higher probability of being successful doing the work is beneficial one thing that I do spend time is I look horizontally to peers for what they're doing and tactical things that are working less strategy and more like tactics like your newsletters growing where you getting those people from how are you creating the campaigns what what is the price Model that you're using all these different details that's where I Look to peers because reading a book about rer Murdoch's not going to help you understand that level of detail one of the most powerful feedback questions that you can ask any friend or anyone is what would you do if you were me I'm running Bay Area times I'm looking to grow it to 500,000 subscribers within the next four months what would you do if it was me I'm actually more careful now than I used to be about giving straightup advice maybe it's maturity maybe it's just like a a lack of um self-awareness uh or or like social awareness previously but now I'll ask a lot of questions hey what do you think about this or have you tried this thing what do you think would happen if you did try it like get them to just think and usually what you find is they know the answers and one of my favorite conversations is where you're basically telling someone like dude let's go you you got to speed this up and you realize they just kind of been bullshitting themselves right and then they like oh yeah you're right okay I got to get to work see you what people should be doing is motivating each other and keeping everyone focused in a world full of distractions now that you're older what are you 34 35 now 35 I'm a real old guy I meet 20 year olds and they're like dude now that you're older do you think you feel more comfortable asking questions now versus you're 23 when I was younger I was arrogant and like hey I know it all I wanted people to think I had the answer even when I did in hindsight you're like man that was so stupid now I'm very Unapologetic about it I was at dinner recently somebody was there he owns one of the hottest movie production companies in the country meet this guy I was like hey man I apologize in advance I got a lot of questions and I started grilling him out of my own curiosity when we got done maybe 20 30 minutes later this guy had the smile on his face from ear to ear he was like nobody ever gives a [ __ ] about the details of my business and so it was cool because then it led to a conversation where he was essentially asking hey what do you think I should be doing how could I use things from the internet to better operations or whatever if you're just like Unapologetic and you explicitly tell people like I'm interested in what you do I don't know anything about it I would love for you to teach me people are so excited to do that and they will end up telling you like a crash course in that industry in that thing that you just can't get anywhere else and so if you think about podcast if you think about all these different tools that we have from a media perspective that's why I enjoy it so much the podcast is the way for to trick smart people into teaching me and then I'm just like oh by the way I'll trade you for your time I'll send out the same conversation to a bunch of people and they'll all like it too but at the end of the day it's like they came on and for an hour taught me something how can you not enjoy doing that so just being Unapologetic about wanting to learn is kind of a superpower in a way are you a media guy now is that how you describe yourself my entire life was always the combination of two things how can I create things or provide things that generate money and how do I invest that money right I understood there are certain sectors I have a unique advantage in because I either understand how they work or understand things that other people don't the second thing is there are industries that I am very interested in and willing to do the work on that other people are not and then the third thing is my track record from an investment perspective is good enough for me to continue to invest the capital in the way that I have been for the last decade it will be a very positive outcome we know the Playbook let's just keep doing this for the next 30 years um and do it in a way that um we are well positioned for resiliency if we don't shoot ourselves in the foot we could build something pretty special what does special mean to you because you can easily just pack it up and sort of write pomp letter basically and live off pomp letter I tried to retire two or three years ago it last like a couple weeks and then I was like already doing [ __ ] for years now I've basically just had the idea I want the economic freedom to be able to spend time with my family my wife and I talking about this recently like you actually don't want to spend 24 hours a day every day with your wife your kids it's important to spend a lot of time but also to have some time apart because it makes the time that you're together special there's balance and for everyone it's a little bit different but having Freedom one of the things many people who work with me know is in the afternoons I usually go for an hour or two long walk and I'll do phone calls while I'm doing it and if I don't have phone calls scheduled I'm walking with my wife and we're talking about various things that we're doing Etc I covet that time if I didn't have the economic freedom to be able to go do that think my life would be worse I would be less happy so that was a big goal the freedom to to spend time with my family the second thing I think a lot about is how do we identify big problems that are out there in the world and weaponize Entrepreneurship and capitalism to solve them if you look at many of the people who have been able to do this throughout the decades usually you have to reach some degree of success and have some degree of security before you really have the ability to do that you trade off shortterm income and and revenue opportunities for long-term impact I was talking to somebody yesterday and I said what are you optimizing for in your career and they were like make more money and that's not a negative answer that's a super honest answer great you should go try to optimize to go do that I think that there's a whole generation of people who are waking up and being like okay at some point that tips from one extra dollar is going to change my life to one extra unit of impact is actually going to further something in the world or give you some sort of intellectual reward I'm optimizing for the ladder what does economic freedom look like to you what does that actually mean when when you're single economic freedom is just like do I have more money than I have bills you kind of get older you get a couple more responsibilities I think it then becomes like okay do I have the ability to not work for two three four five years and have enough money in the bank to cover expenses or something like that and then eventually it gets to like do I have a set up where I can cover expenses for a very long time and also I have capital or value in a mechanism that will allow for my wife my kids anything if I was to be hurt die whatever they will be okay as well I have friends that uh they live in super rural area $5,000 a month they're golden right and so like I don't know right now you put $100,000 in treasury bills like you're good on the other hand I have friends that you know they're living on credit cards and you're like dude you literally have a lifestyle that you can't make enough money like there there is no amount of money you're going to make that is going to be able to give you true economic freedom everyone focuses on the revenue side the expense side's pretty important and expenses I put expenses as both the actual Financial expenses but also the expectations or like the mental expense and so the lower your expectation the lower your need obviously it's easier to hit and so just optimize for low need High you know quotequote return and you're in a great spot I think a lot of us fall into lifestyle creep there's one person I have in mind the guy makes millions of dollars a year but he spends millions of dollars a year and he's literally living on debt I think you do have to do some soul searching around what is important what are the things that I want in my life figure out what economic freedom means to you I totally agree with that I know a lot of people who spend money on things you or I think are stupid but it makes them happy and I don't think of that as a negative expense because they're getting the intellectual stimulation or the positive benefit of it maybe they pay a really high rent because they want to live in a nice place they work from there but they don't own a car and they're just like I really don't go anywhere and so like I don't also have a Ferrari there are ways to balance things out and obviously the point of trying to drive economic value for yourself and for your family is to enjoy it but you gota figure out what do you actually enjoy doing and what are you trying to do because everyone else is doing it can you talk about what impact you want to make and how you think about coming up with what that is for yourself one example we've got a business in the employment sector we've helped over 3,000 people get a job in the last two years it's like wow we changed 3,000 people's lives where they were able to go get a job make more money like do all this kind of stuff we didn't start out one we're going to make an impact in people's lives right but very much it was aligned with okay we can create a capitalist driven business where we make money but we are doing it because we are serving both companies and these potential hires and so that's like a great way of like jobs and employment is a problem let's go try to solve that we are making a positive impact but we also have aligned it with revenue and a sustainable business there's another way to look at it which is every time we partner with someone to create a business we are essentially giving them the option for Freedom uh take a media property we have a media property we recently launched there was somebody working at a big media company now they're not and guess what they're going to make a hell of a lot more money doing it solo than working inside of that big company we are going to make sure that it is successful when some weird way positive impact could simply just be one person getting into the game of owning their own business where they have more unlimited upside than inside of a corporation and then there's also impact in terms of philanthropic stuff and you know plan and I spent a lot of time there trying to think through what what can we do where is you know kind of Leverage points to to kind of create positive impact but also if people go to dinner with me one of the things I will always say if you ever get the bill let's say you're at dinner and the Bill's $100 throw an extra three to5 dollar in it it don't mean that much to you right it means way more to the person who's receiving it than the person giving it and what you find is you just went from 20 to 25% tip that literally is the difference someone being okay I got my 20% tip between wow that person is so generous it's three to five bucks forget the gener generosity piece that person gets that extra money looks it smiles and not to be corny but the world becomes a better place cuz that person is more likely to be more kind 100% people if they did a good job what's the extra five bucks whatever just having that mentality as you go through life if you can get in that mentality of like help everyone around you be better get better make more money do all this stuff I promise you value will acre back to you over the long run one of the things I tell every person I meet let me know if I can ever help you when I started saying it people were like that's weird I have had people call me and be like the equivalent of like I may be going to jail what should I do all the way to people who are like hey a family member needs a job or anything in between and what you find is like I'm not some magician I can't solve all these problems but you know what I can do you need a job in a certain sector I know somebody who works in that industry let me introduce you to them if you have that positive impact and you continue that over the long run then value comes back to you you're not doing it because the value is going to to come back but it's one of these things where it's good for the world you feel good selfish in the way that like you feel good doing it but then also it happens to be good for business over the long run I have to ask what are two three four books that folks should be studying if they care about building a business on the internet unreasonable hospitality is a great one there's Bunch on rert there's also a book called the successor on Lin Murdoch rert son that tells the story from a different perspective there's a book called the 50th law by Robert Green and 50 Cent fantastic IC about overcoming fear uh obviously Peter teal 0 to1 there's a book on sulon oen sulaman is one of the wealthiest individuals that came out of Saudi Arabia the book is nearly impossible to get but it really explains like he just kept saying yes every time someone was like hey do you know someone who does this and he'd be like yes I can do that and he' create a business for it I've Tak a lot of inspiration from that mentality how to get rich uh Felix Dennis uh Sam Parr told me about that one I thought that one was pretty pretty good Richard Branson's book is really good the rise and fall of American growth that one's fantastic my wife wrote a book called hidden genius Nob brainer best seller all about how successful people are successful The Outsiders by Will Thorndike talks All About decentralized Management share BuyBacks stuff like that um Elon Musk Walter Isaak urgency how he's built the businesses that he's built um let's see the war of art have you read that never even heard of it that's a super easy one stepen pressfield the war of art is fantastic I'll give you like a weird one good profit by Charles kooch good profit is probably one of the best business books I've ever read he went back and he looked at what made great civilizations what are the Dynamics in terms of governance and economics and incentives and all this stuff then he brought it into his business and he created something called market-based management coch Industries is I think the first or second largest private company uh in America and he like swears by this market-based management we'll put uh pomps list in the show notes thanks for coming on I appreciate it

when I tweeted about this discovery I got almost a million impressions and more than 4,000 bookmarks funnily enough only a 100 people shared it but I know exactly why this happened they didn't want their competitors to find out about this I'm sorry for you folks I can't keep this secret for any longer hey friends glad to have you back on the channel in this video I'm going to share with you an unconventional way to create landing pages that increase my conversion rate 300% and you know the craziest part it takes even less work than building a regular landing page so I changed how I launch startups and building successful startups has now become 10x easier my old approach when inspiration struck I'd immediately start creating a meticulous onepage spec do a one-pager but if I'm being honest many of those spec dos went nowhere my my notion is full of Dusty one pagers waiting for their elusive moment to shine so my new approach go straight from startup idea to landing page but I don't create an ordinary landing page instead I Implement a new landing page model 99% of people will tell you this won't work after all it goes against everything we've been taught about writing copy on the internet since well forever when I first implemented this model into my unbundling of Reddit guide lots of my friends made fun of me and said I was crazy but now we're seeing conversion Skyrocket like never before and the same goes for our other products at late checkout so I know it works I call them tweet size landing pages or tlps for short they're basically conversion focused landing pages with Max 280 characters instead of drafting a tweet you draft the landing page most landing pages nowaday are pretty long and they end up drowning out out the core message but let's be real people barely have 30 seconds to watch a Tik Tok now what makes you think people are going to break through a wall of copy on a super long landing page so I'll give you the Playbook on how to create your very own tweet size landing page so you can cut through the noise number one mystery humans are questioning creatures we're naturally drawn to Mysteries and when there is Mystery there is curiosity there is intrigue and most importantly there is desire when you're designing a landing page you need to make sure that the user needs to find out what's on the other side of that subscribe button and they need to know now so you need to find a way to ignite that Curiosity in 280 characters or less scarcity tactics like limited availability or exclusivity work like a charm since you can create a sense of urgency and excitement in the reader number two playfulness corporate Vibes just don't cut it anymore people are sick of sales pitches if you sound greedy or too robotic people just won't listen so don't just make your landing page short and digestible make it easy make it fun and make it quirky don't underestimate the power of fun and playfulness when it comes to conversions you'll be pretty surprised number three a weird photo of you if that doesn't make you hit the Subscribe button I don't know what will I spent $1,500 for a night to stay at a hotel called the Palm Heights hotel in Grand Cayman just so I could snap this picture of me sitting on this famous chair you might be surprised that this works but it does a unique picture of you looking at the camera being you is a must showing your personality boost conversions like nothing you could believe and not just your landing page your brand in general number four a clear cool call to action for a free item we're done with subscribe buttons we're so used to seeing them nowadays that they just fade into the background people are allergic to subscribing or signing up to anything they want to smash the button to get a freebie they want to dive into a new world it may sound cheesy but it'll help you stick out pair this with a huge button that contrasts the sit's background and you'll get more clicks bonus use the Aida framework for add copy Aida stands for attention interest desire action attention grab them in line interest peak curiosity in the next desire show them what they need action a compelling call to action to finish attention imagine this Sleek Tesla Model 3 set against the backdrop of New York City the ad copy The Future Has has arrived the interest in AA you show this closeup of the Tesla dashboard showing the autopilot feature driving reimagine is the copy desire you see this Tesla Model 3 on this open Highway who knows maybe it's Elon mus driving it gains gridlock traffic backto back the ad copy Stand Out Glide ahead and then action in Aida the ad copy free test drive one mile away that's the AA framework influence and convert efficiency at its finest you can even prompt chat gbt to write copy for you in the AATA framework use this prompt pretend you're a top ad copywriter write in the AI to framework with Max 280 characters some ad copy that will convert you know the best part about tweet size landing pages they are only going to get more popular with time whether it's their product or their content in general more and more creators are seeing the value of giving away free stuff in exchange for more trust from Their audience so that way when you do launch that paid product there's no need to shove it down people's throats they already know you're worth the investment because you've given them value and value over time through these freebies and tlps are such a great way to give away free items I encourage you to give it a try remember the biggest Innovations in history were people who went against the grain and this whole tslp thing it's a great reminder that when people go left maybe you should go right I'll leave the link to the

But the reality is more complicated than that.

this idea that nobody talks about is that there is a diminishing return on money and I also have this weird idea I've been toying with that it's actually there's negative marginal Returns on money as you get more of it as I watch people who are super duper rich like G6 or whatever the more expensive version of that you spend a lot of time a protecting the money and B trying to figure out who around them is not a faker I think being somewhat Rich that's the perfect thing rather than have to get more money and then you know you eventually get to a point where you're like Jeff Bezos where you're just like he's just trapped in his Fame each an additional dollar actually makes his life worse in my opinion so I think there's an inflection point it's somewhere around being able to afford flying private above that I think the marginal utility of dollars eventually turns negative

When it comes to buying businesses, most people take the “front door” approach: looking at listings, going through brokers, and so on.

However, it’s often the serendipitous moments or the coincidental connections you have built over time that result in the most rewarding opportunities.

Building a network isn't a sprint; it's a marathon.

Vanity metrics are not the best way to measure your content's impact.

Instead, it is determined by the number of people who benefit from each piece of content you put out. 

Getting 1 DM from a follower saying how your content changed their lives is more rewarding than all the likes in the world.

the main reason that I decided to work with a publisher was self-publishing has great limitations like even though you make more per book with self-publishing the amount of reach that you get when you're actually in every single bookstore around the world is just so much bigger you'll make less per book through your average publisher but the fact that your book is in airports that it's in like you know local bookstores everywhere that it's like just in like an in every Barnes & Noble that helps so much more than just being on Amazon cuz I think Amazon definitely does the majority of book sales but it doesn't do all the book sales yet

he did it hey hey everyone welcome back to the channel my name is Greg Eisenberg and in this video I'll be exploring some of the biggest internet Empires built by using the ACP funnel a revolutionary new framework that's changing the landscape of business and leveling the playing field for entrepreneurs and creators all over the world if you're interested in learning more about the ACP funnel and how to grow your very own internet Empire then check out my community Empire course and membership it's got the playbooks Union need the research you need the accountability you need to put you on the path to building your very own internet Empire powered by community in today's video we're going to take a look at the process that Ryan holiday used to find his audience build his community and create products that sell like hot cakes let's get to [Music] it the first thing that comes to mind when you mention Ryan holiday is STO ISM after all it's thanks to this ancient philosophy that Ryan became well known but his Beginnings were very different Ryan began his journey in the world of marketing and his first book trust me I'm lying was a Chronicle of his time working as the director of marketing for now defunct American Apparel working directly with its founder Dove Charney having built successful campaigns at American Apparel Ryan knew exactly how to get get people's attention and that's how he built his own audience he knew how to come up with ideas that stuck that people talked about and that's one of the most underrated skills imagine you're scrolling through your Instagram how do you create content that's going to get you to stop those are sticky ideas back to Ryan while his book established himself as a writer it was actually far from what he wanted to do when he was in college Ryan got into stoic philosophy which was a passion he always always wanted to explore further so with writing skills under his belt and experience on how to publish a book a couple years later Ryan released his next book The obstacle is the way it was an immediate success Ryan didn't expect the reaction that he got from the book and that's when he came to a million dooll realization there did not exist a distillation of stoicism in a way that gen Z and Millennials could consume thanks to guys like Sen and aredes thousands of years ago Ryan had all the content but he just had to figure out how to repackage it and so Ryan had found his audience stage two Community Ryan saw an opportunity in the niche of stoicism and I know what you're thinking stoicism doesn't seem Niche at all it isn't today but it was when Ryan started Ryan basically repop poiz stoicism for a new audience after the obstacle is the way two more books on stoicism followed ego is the enemy and the daily stoic does the name ring a bell the daily stoic was easy to translate into a Blog a podcast a newsletter with over 300,000 subscribers and an Instagram with over 3 million followers where Ryan began to share Snippets of stoic wisdom and short form video his content was clearly resonating and gaining traction so he knew it was time time to take things to the next level stage three product Ryan's case is very unique as he was able to give his audience a community and a product at the exact same time his community grew as people not only resonated with the wisdom he was sharing but were also interested in how he was applying stoicism to Modern Life challenges having deep understanding of his community needs and having already introduced them to stoicism through his writings Ryan recognized the potential for not just books so he packed his daily stoic website with a series of challenges courses and memberships for people who wanted to extend the stoic experience Beyond just reading this gave rise to the Daily stoic brand most of these offerings included deeper information deeper teaching and deeper books but more important ently they granted people access to a community of like-minded people who were trying to apply stoicism to their daily lives plus Ryan started to offer merchandise like the momento Mori ring that was carefully designed to support and remind people that they're part of the stoic Community it's just like when you graduate from engineering school and they give you an engineering ring people graduate from Reading Ryan stoicism and they want that ring and they're willing to drop hundreds of dollars on it and it creates this flywheel the more they look at the ring the more connected they are to the community the more products they want to buy it goes with all saying these offerings from Ryan have been a massive success and it's mainly because these products aren't just products they're a gateway to a community that Ryan's audience is desperately in search of and the best part is Ryan doesn't need to sell these products he doesn't need to convince anyone to buy them with his free articles free newsletters free videos Ryan has proved time and time again that he can provide value so he has easily managed to gain his community's [Music] trust Ryan holiday has not only shared stoicism with a modern twist but has provided his audience with tangible tools to integrate into their daily Liv lives and a community of like-minded stoics to share their experience with Ryan's story is a great example of the ACP funnel and how any person from any Walk of Life can Leverage The Power of online communities to build a profitable business so that's it for today's video If you like this video and want more internet Empire breakdowns

I spent like two and a half years not making any money and just like working on myself as an individual and trying to craft my writing develop my voice as a writer work on my manuscript like Instagram X threads like these places will be beautiful Avenues they make it really easy to connect with other people the young Pueblo audience it's about 3.4 3.5 million people now across all the networks having sold a million bucks after having become a number one New York Times bestseller it's just allowed me to speak to investors in a way they really take you seriously Diego I've been looking forward to this for months I have been following you for years I think probably since like 2016. oh wow yeah 2017 early days when I remember you were the first person I'd heard talk about self-love wow wow yeah yeah I didn't know wow that's that's really um shocking because I didn't know you were following for that long I've been following you I think for about two years it was funny because it was at a time when I was first starting my Venture Capital company everything you were saying about uh startups I was like just eating it all up I wanted to kick it off by just trying to understand your business Empire my main thing is um I write under the name Young Pueblo I think I started taking it really seriously around 2015. that was my primary focus for until about 2020 when I started opening up and getting into the Venture Capital world but the young Pueblo work it's basically it stems from like the development of my personal life where I you know used to be just quite a big mess like I was you know partying all the time just pushing my body to the edge as much as much as possible I really hit a wall and a rock bottom point where I almost lost my life and when I realized that I couldn't push myself any further I was like I need to start accepting you know what's happening inside of me like these emotions that I'm trying to ignore I ended up you know like changing my habits like changing how I ate changing the way I interact with people I eventually started meditating when I started meditating I realized that the big changes were happening inside of me where my mind felt a lot less intense than it used to and I didn't have as intense reactions when you know difficult situations would arise so to me all those changes were really surprising another byproduct of that was that my creativity started blossoming in a way where it never had before and I started writing and that's really where young Pueblo came about and I've since released three books I have a fourth one coming out it was sometime during 2020 when I felt like something was missing I was like you know I love this work that I'm doing I love writing books but I also want to be able to help people in other ways and then this idea came forward to build wisdom Ventures which is basically a venture capital company that's trying to invest in companies and Founders that are trying to build their products in a compassionate manner so whether they're building in the wellness field or not they're intentionally designing their products in a way that keeps the well-being of the user in mind and um and that's been just fantastic work we actually just finished raising our fund one for 10 million dollars and we're focusing on pre-seed and Seed Investments and um it's been a phenomenal work can you expand on what it means to be compassionate like what is a compassionate Adventure really mean it means that you're being really cognizant of the other person's perspective and like what's best for their well-being if you look at the basic social medias that products that just can you know capture attention make you you know really sort of of like addicted isolated lonely like we know how to build things like that but can we build things that can provide a great service but simultaneously don't hurt your mind in the process right aren't making you a worse version of yourself or aren't making it um you know we want to be able to treat your mind as beautiful place that we care for not one that we're trying to damage there is a wide variety of products like that I think there's one in particular we just invested in bereavement company that's like when you have a loved one that passes away you don't quite think about how many things go into taking care of them as an individual like and simultaneously taking care of your own mental health while that's happening and on top of that taking care of all of like the legal aspects of who gets what and how is debt handled and but this company better leave um it basically Aggregates all those things that you would need in one place to help you through that bereavement process so that it's not as stiff difficult on you and how is compassion good business I think that's that's the what we're trying to prove like I got really inspired by um I think the clothing world is like one of the first places where you saw people care more about how their products were produced because the consumers were like hey I would love if my clothes are made by people who are getting paid well in a way that is less damaging to the environment and I think that same type of energy we want to bring I think it's going to work when I started talking about community-based product well always told me oh that's not that's not going to be a big turn for investors it's not going to be a big big opportunity and he sort of had to deal with a lot of crap from people for a long period of time so you're very much in that stage where it's like year one of like I haven't even heard the term compassionate you know startups before fashion Adventures so you are you're you know you're creating this category and you're proving out that thesis and I think it makes sense because there's definitely this movement and you're seeing it on on the Forefront just being on like writing your books and on being on Instagram of people wanting uh wanting almost like the anti products they want the anti-tick-tock yeah when we first created wisdom Ventures that was a lot of the conversation was like we were hoping to invest in that next generation of social media that can help connect people without all these addictive like byproducts I think there definitely has to be a different way we um simultaneously surprise and not by how much like investors just came up you know like investors came through and were like yeah like this sounds great this is like a a wonderful experiment you have the book business you have the you know the Instagram social audience you have the Venture business walk me through how you think about each of the businesses the young Pueblo audience that's grown over the years um it's about 3.4 3.5 million people now across all the networks the books are all other opportunities for me arise from you know the quality of the writing that I'm putting out having sold the million bucks after having come in number one New York Times bestseller it's just allowed me to like Leverage that work to then you know be able to speak to investors in a way where you know they really take you seriously um in terms of like building the Venture Capital company and being able to connect my audience to all of these companies that we're investing in and show them like hey like you know I'm direct directly investing in these companies being able to give such a wide audience knowledge about that these companies even exist especially at the startup level that's like a huge bonus to them because I'm you know 30 35 and I learned pretty clearly when when I first started was that like you want to win people over first and institutions later so that's why I like that Instagram was so important to like get it out there and get pieces of the book out there floating so to see if um you know people were understanding that what I was writing and at the same time I decided to self-publish a book to see how it would do and it you know it went pretty well I think I self-published my first book Inward and it was out there for six months um I think I sold like 12 000 copies what is a you know good amount and it also kind of proved to Publishers that you know this is worthwhile so then I then you know I got signed the book was re-released into bookstores but to me like whether it's a new book that I'm releasing or a company that I'm trying to build myself or some or a company that I'm supporting through Venture Capital like communities everything you know people are going to decide whether this product is valuable they're going to test it out for themselves and if it's good they then tell their friends and to me that's been like everything and it's the same thing like when you're an author you do you know whatever book you have you have a pre-order stage and during that pre-order stage you make it five thousand ten thousand fifteen fifty thousand pre-orders then once people actually get the book and they start reading it if they like it then that 50 000 becomes 150 000 or 200 000 because they like it and it's the same thing for our company you know they they you have a small group of people who test out a product and if it's enjoyable and if it provides a service that they don't already have then it'll spread like fire someone asked me just before this call how do you know when you have product Market fit and I was like if you're asking yourself if you have product Market fit you don't have product Market fit you know people are going to be screaming it they're going to want to tell people whenever I make something when I make a new book or when I'm working on a new venture I'm always trying to tell myself like make something that's useful right that if it's useful and you want to like carry it around with you or to me it's like one of the biggest compliments that I get about um the books that I've written is if someone's like oh I always keep your book in my purse or I always keep your my book on your nightstand to me it's like wow that means that you find a lot of value in this book and and that's great because I'm hoping that these books serve as a point of inspiration for you to help you know either improve your relationships or keep transforming your life for the better how do you think about building on other people's platforms like on Instagram versus you know a newsletter where you own the relationship man it's tough man that's been the the great conversation in the past it's a double-edged like sword wear Outlet on one end it's really positive because like Instagram you know X um threads like these places will be you know beautiful Avenues they make it really easy to connect with other people but then at the end of the day you have no idea how the algorithm works and because it you have no control over it you have no control over how these companies change then those changes may not always benefit you in the past like three years I've been really focusing on just building a newsletter and I've found a home on substack because I've become friends with the people who who have built substack and have seen the depth of their commitment to how they're always going to keep that like that Nexus of sub stack where you have direct connection with your audience where you know you send something to them and they all receive it via email and there's no algorithm between you and another person and to me that's like so critical and I think looking back I feel like if I would have done things differently I would have definitely put a lot more emphasis on building a newsletter in like starting in 2016 as opposed to starting in 2020. yeah when you talk to like James clear or Tim Ferriss they always say like everything is about the newsletter I think they're completely correct and I and now I find myself like um in a way following in their footsteps and like tracing everything pointing it all back to the newsletter so that people know like if you really want to hang out like that's the place where we should hang out 100 when you say like you know these businesses you know is it just you like are you managing the Instagram like who's behind young Pueblo oh behind young Pueblo it's just me and my wife so my wife was initially um she worked as a scientist for many years and um she actually took care of the two of us when I was first developing young Pueblo so I I spent like two and a half years not making any money and just like working on um working on myself as an individual and trying to craft my writing develop my voice as a writer work on my manuscript and eventually you know it sort of started picking up steam and becoming bigger and bigger and um she wanted more flexibility in her life so she decided to start working with me so I do all the posting all of social media but she will handle the relationship with you know the different Publishers that we have with the Italian agencies because I'm also you know represented by United United talent agency and we're considering hiring like one or two more people but at the same time like spoken to James clear about this too it's like he just has one person that he works with as well I've heard that um to think John Cabot Zen also has a similar sort of setup where like he just does what he can do and you know if people have to wait a lot for him to respond to emails like he just just you know has decided that it would make his life easier if he just is you know the one who's actually there typing everything and I have a lot of respect for that the Publishers help a ton because they come with their own teams but having it just be me and my wife I think keeps it manageable so that my attention can then focus on the Venture Capital world because that that requires just just me on that side I think Ryan holiday has a bigger team with you know the daily stoic and what he's working on what have you followed Ryan's work at all and curious like what you think of totally totally yeah yeah I've spoken from what do you think of his model I've spoken to him his model is working well I think it just depends on where you want your biggest Revenue coming from I saw one time brene Brown took a picture of her team and it was like 20 something people it was like tons of people and when I saw that picture one I was very happy for her um but then I thought about myself in that context and I was like you know I think I would just be like too stressed out by by having to manage all these people and then I think there are some points where I would feel like I'd have to write books just to pay all these people that's is stressful because then you you're right in a lot of sense you're creating products to support them and then it's like am I working for them are they working for me I I just spoke to a friend yesterday and he was telling me how you know he also um is out there on Instagram has more than a million followers but he got to a point where he had so many employees that just his monthly overhead was over a hundred thousand dollars in terms of like paying people and he was like what am I doing you know this is like this is totally getting out of hand and he had to totally scale back and you know for the right reason I also heard that Alex or Mosey has and Layla hermosi have been spending like hundreds of thousands of dollars a month on their content team one of the things I'm thinking about is like is it a chicken and an egg type thing like do you need to spend money to create content to get the audience to create the services like what do you what do you think of when you hear stories about like Alex hermosi who basically you know became popular via his content team yeah I think it's you know it just depends on what type of um content you're putting out there if it's like business content that's specific and you're trying to get a quick audience then it's totally possible you know you just have to spend money and hire the right people who who know how to like go viral because I think going viral is not like um there's like a recipe to it it's not it's not like something like uh that's that's too difficult to do I mean people musicians do it all the time there's like after a while when you become a musician and you get good at it you know how to write a hit and like you know you can just look at Drake over and over again there's like similarities between the hits that he puts out there what's worked for me and what's helped me with my longevity to keep like chugging along has been to just stay as genuine as possible and to just like like the the center of everything I do is meditating so like I just have to keep meditating like I meditate two hours a day one hour in the morning one hour in the evening I go to meditation Retreats like uh you know if you times a year usually usually one of them will be longer like 30 or 45 days long and and that to me is like that clears my mind enough that when I sit down and I write um you know I write with the intention of like putting something that's actually useful for people and then it all sort of works itself out I want to come back to meditation but who are some social media entrepreneurs you look up to the dude who's like really the boss man is um is James Clear he made his bet and he bet on the newsletter and his bed totally paid off I think him and Mark Manson uh like I listened to them really closely I think I probably have more more social media followers than both of them but they sell more books than I do and and I think it's because of the way the way that they have set up their being more newsletter focused and having just fantastic content because I think when I think about James's you know his book Atomic habits that book not only has great promotion with his Weekly Newsletter but it's a fantastic book it's it's just it's the bow the book is just phenomenal like you know I've given it to people as a gift many times over and they find it incredibly useful so I think in in my mind that like I'm really inspired by that um you know when you bring that beautiful combination together of like a high quality product with fantastic marketing then you're gonna have a tremendous hit Beauty about Atomic habits is there's so many rituals involved and he can use this content to bring back like everything points back to these Atomic habits right so he uh he almost crafted the perfect book with the perfect amount of rituals with the perfect medium of newsletter uses Instagram in a really smart way where he always draws it back to the newsletter I wonder if James Clear like was he really passionate about Atomic habits or did he see the opportunity to build this ecosystem oh that's really interesting I have a friend who worked with him before um before he released Atomic habits ooh she she worked at Business Insider and it was back when he would release articles but I bet he learned a lot um from releasing articles and just finding out like which ones were of good quality which ones like you know made sense and which ones people enjoyed and shared it with others and I you know I've learned from that and do like a similar thing with my newsletter where um I released the book called lighter that was my first non-fiction book longer form where I really go deeply into personal development a number of chapters of that book are built off of newsletters that I released that um that I knew performed really well and so I would take that you know something that was maybe like 700 words and then built a whole chapter out of it and I think using that framework of testing out the way that you set something up or what you write banding on it in a book it's like such a good way to produce a book these days yeah I had someone on the Pod recently Nicholas Cole and he's published 10 books he told me a book is basically eight really good blog posts because I told him I was like dude he was actually he he hit me up and he was like you should write a book and I was like I can't write a book you kidding me oh you definitely could write a book man come on dude your your posts go viral all the time you can just take them and that's dude I mean that's what he said and then he was just like you've been writing weekly for years you have to go back and just kind of put it together and expand upon it and write examples yeah I mean question for you I mean selfishly like someone like me who um has a niche you know an area expertise in a particular space um who writes writes on the internet who hasn't really been drawn so much to books because I love the instant gratification of you know this morning I published a newsletter press publish and I got feedback instantaneously or you post a tweet and you get a thousand like why should someone like me write a book books still sell like if it's a good book maybe five percent of books that are released to actually sell a lot of copies but out of those five percent like some of them sell extremely well if the topic is really good people will give you their attention and they'll like read your book over a week or two week period if they've trusted you for this long then they're gonna trust you to give you multiple hours of their time time to be able to go deep into a book and I think it's phenomenal these days the fact that you can read a book like as a physical book or you can read it on your phone on the Kindle app or you can read it or you can listen to it as an audiobook that gives people so many different ways to interact with it and you know when you listen to a book it's just like you're just basically listening to a podcast it's been interesting the way that like even though our attention is getting totally overwhelmed by our phones and by our TVs at the same time like I think books are selling really well the other thing too is that you know you can leverage your work like I think you you'd be surprised that if you've written a lot over the past year or two years you can just do the the sort of editing process rather quickly and just pull out like what are the most highly rated highly valued highly commented highly liked things that I've written put them out in front of you and then you can start writing from there that won't stop you from creating basically a whole new product out of that original material so you just leverage that old material and deepen it enhance it and then put it back out there and nobody will be upset it'll it'll benefit everybody because the people who loved it the first time they'll enjoy reading it the deeper version a publisher won't get mad that you like you know release that in some other fashion before because publishing companies they're basically just Venture Capital companies like they literally will just you know they'll make a hundred bets and they they're all like tiny Investments to them and a few of them work out so they're really focused on the investment that's going to pan out and how has working with the publisher been for you like you mentioned your books now in all these bookstores and that's amazing on the other hand I know how much being light is important to you I would imagine that if you have a publisher you know they want you to publish as much as possible it's like having as you said a venture capitalist right like they it's they want you to grow and they're incentivized for you to to create a lot of content so how has been working with a publisher been for you and why haven't you self-published all the way yeah that's a great question self-publishing has great limitations like even though you make more per book with self-publishing the amount of reach that you get when you're actually in every single bookstore around the world your book is in airports that it's in like you know local bookstores everywhere that it's like that that helps so much more than just being on Amazon and because I think Amazon definitely does the majority of book sales but it doesn't do all the book sales yet so having it in stores feels like uh not only like a big like personal Victory just because I've Loved bookstores my whole life but I think it increases the reach of the book itself and I think it's worthwhile because you you you had a particular audience but then there's like a magic that can happen in the bookstore where people can see it and then slowly the your book if it's being bought a lot in a particular bookstore it'll work its way up to the front of the bookstore and that doesn't quite happen if you only have an audience of like you know a hundred thousand people and they can only access it on Amazon um so I think yeah bookstores are still quite powerful yeah it's surprising how powerful the airport bookstore is oh the airport is the big win man when you I like it took me years to get into the airport years and even now when I walk in and just see like only in the past like year and a half have I been in the airport my wife and I are like wow like we did it in the airport yeah I I just Googled um Hudson the largest airport bookstore in in North America and they're only in North America yet they're bringing in 1.8 billion dollars a yard Revenue so yeah it's such a tight selection too like the selection is so tight in places also like um like Target like if you can get your book in Target you're going to sell a ton of books for people listening it's really about like what trade-offs do you want to make if you are looking to reach the masses it sounds like having a Publisher's still necessary for me I'm just curious about the Prof like I'm a curious person so the idea of like oh maybe I'll make a book because it'll be fun to do um and I'll just you know start with myself publishing and then maybe see where it goes yeah I think it's I think it's totally worth a shot and you'd be surprised I think you can put out a fantastic book in like six months it really doesn't have to be like the most like grueling intense process especially if you're writing from scratch then it would take like two two and a half years right but if you've already been writing a ton then all you have to do is basically start with the elimination process right you can literally just go to your analytics and see like what performed well and what didn't and then that that makes it really easy for you how important has the the pen name of young Pueblo been for you if you went out as you know Diego perez.young play Pueblo would you be less popular more popular the same man that's the great question I think there was something about the pen name that was just like so different that caught a little bit more of people's attention I see a lot of authors you know have pen names not have pen names but to me it just felt like um like it made sense like because young Pueblo means young people and it hit me so hard when I was meditating that like I was really immature like I have a lot of growing up to do but I have been studying history my whole life and when I you know was examining like Humanity I was like wait Humanity has a lot of growing up to do like we really do not Excel we have not mastered the basic things of you know that we get taught in kindergarten like the the basic things of cleaning up after ourselves telling the truth sharing with each other not hitting each other being kind to one another like these fundamental things that were taught as five-year-olds and four-year-olds we may be able to do these things as individuals but as a human Collective we suck at them we're like really bad at that and I thought of this work when I was um you know writing like my first second third book I was like it feels really important to to be you know even a small part of this like maturation of humanity that's happening right now and I was like okay where can I help and I I thought let me put the emphasis on personal transformation because as I've been studying more and more it you know it doesn't like the type of system that we have whether it's you know a communist system socialist whether it's capitalist you know libertarian if you have people that are like highly traumatized you know or people that are too self-centered then it's gonna be really hard to have a peaceful world um so I think you know if we're able to develop our self-love and treat ourselves better heal ourselves better then we're going to be less inclined to hurt other people intentionally or on in turn or unintentionally so and part of that you know is not just with the personal transformation it's also in terms of our relationships like if we can love each other better and we can be not only better friends to each other but also better um like intimate partners with each other then there's going to be a lot less harm that's going to be reproduced in the world so I try to write always with that mindset in in the hopes that you know hopefully I can Inspire individuals maybe that inspiration will trickle that word and help help Humanity become a little more peaceful and you think the name Young Pueblo just when people are scanning Instagram do you think they they taste a little they're like what is that yeah what do you what do you think go you know crosses their mind I've heard a lot of different things like some people think it's like you know like I'm a big fan of of young the psychoanalyst um but I've never read any of Young's books like I actually prefer Freud I think I've like read a lot of Freud's books and then you know you hear one of the podcasts or something that I've been on and and um you get a sense of like oh this this is where it's coming from there's like a a bigger Mission here I think when you're choosing your name a little bit of mystery is important because if you think about it it's a game for capturing attention so you're on these social platforms you have you have something you want to say and your goal is to get someone to click your profile then once you're on someone's profile and your new game is to convert them to follow you so it's this commitment curve that I think you have and that's why I think pen names are so powerful I don't think we would be having this conversation you know New York number one you know times best-selling author if if your name was something else right there yeah you know I I I love I love that feedback too because I think um there have been times when I'm like wondering to myself like why did I do that but I'm actually grateful to my former self when I um you know decided to just stick with the pen name Young Pueblo reminds me like oh yeah this is just a project so make sure that you say what's actually worth saying and that it doesn't become this like giant money game do you feel more free that you can talk as young Pueblo for sure and also like I've been on a lot of podcasts I've probably been interviewed on like 80 plus podcasts but but I don't really get recognized I also don't put my face up on social media very often only when I'm like you know if I go on TV to promote a book or something like that I think it's helped me like maintain a lot of anonymity which I'm pretty grateful for because I love just you know being in a supermarket with my wife and nobody noticing us I'm really curious so um Greg how far does your um like how big is your audience now across all networks um probably like six hundred thousand so not not huge um but it it's a very high quality audience so it's a lot of people a lot of business builders a lot of investors uh just people interested in creation and community so I'm really interested now in equipping these people with like more tools and tactics if I know something that other people don't and I could equip them with knowledge to build these types of businesses like don't I have to be in service to do those things like don't I have to give away all this knowledge um and the reason I had that uh sort of idea is just over the last few years I've had you know the crazy stories of people been like I was working at a McDonald's and I read one of your blog post and I was able to you know create a business that's not worth eight figures you know I started this Discord Community as like a 17 year old and now it's a paid Discord community and it's bringing in eight hundred thousand dollars a year and I was able to you know buy a house for my mom and all these like crazy stories of like hey I picked up on some information I applied the information so like just today we launched this membership called communityempire.com where it's basically you know a bunch of my playbooks and tools and tactics and accountability calls for my team and stuff like that and I want to see these people who join this thing are they actually going to be able to create their own Community Empires and I think I'm on this path around like equipping these people with as much Swiss Army knives as possible man I gotta sign up that sounds awesome I think yeah it's it's cool hearing about it uh about the way you constructed things too because it just sounds so smart I imagine is a lot of that like a lot of those numbers is a newsletter Focus newsletter and Twitter yeah the Twitter algorithm treats you well I mean it's because you you give a lot in each post and I think it's more than other people I think that's why your stuff stood out to me so much it's funny to me because it's just listening to you talk you probably have like two books inside of you I have two two books actually I have the concepts for them one is Community Empire and it's an expanded version of of what of basically the playbooks inside communityempire.com which is how do you build an audience how do you convert that audience into a community then how do you get ideas from that Community to build them products that they're obsessed with and all the different business models associated with it my second book I don't know if I want to say what the second book is it's related to the first book I'll tell you another time I love how I hit it on the dot I was like just listening to you talk I'm like man you got like two books in you just right now I think to like support your friend who told you you should write a book I think you should definitely do it man because I've noticed that when whenever I release a new book my communities just grow especially the first three four months after the book is released and a lot of that is from Friends gifting the book because you'll find that some of your best people that love your work they're just not online right they're just not people that like spend tons of Time online they're not that Savvy with you know Twitter and whatnot and they don't sign up to any newsletters but somehow they end up getting your book through their friend and then it's like then then they sign up to the community that's a really good takeaway for folks listening which is when you're thinking about creating content and that could be a book it could be a podcast it could be a newsletter it could be a community there's Different Strokes for different folks basically I just wrote a post the other day um on substack about advice to new writers and I told them you know don't forget that you're a writer first and foremost and not a social media manager I find with like myself and with other people who are out there it's like they'll stretch themselves so far on every single platform that it's just sort of like devaluing and like they're spending too much time figuring out how to go viral as opposed to just just write something that's amazing it's easier said than done because you know what you know what happens is there's a lot of creators and I'm guilty of this sometimes too where I'll see a type of post that goes viral and I'll be like ah like how come my stuff's not going viral and I'll be like maybe maybe I should put this concept in that format and then all of a sudden like you're doing things for the wrong reasons content first and algorithm second not algorithm first and content second you should be pleasing the algorithm Gods at first especially as all this whole AI wave hits Us in more and more content feels very cookie cutter the stuff that's gonna stand out is this unique remarkable exceptional weird stuff uh that it comes from being yourself yeah I'm curious too sometimes we create these funnels where we know what our audience likes but we are also able to integrate what we like into that and then we post it but it gets so strict over time that you know it almost feels like um you're like losing 50 of potential creativity people know what they what to expect from you and since I've been breaking away from that like being on Instagram and being on like threads and Twitter has been so much more fun because I'm just like you know what I don't even care let me just let me just post and see what happens and it almost feels like in a way that I'm like playing around in a way where it was like 2016 but I'm wondering for you like what you know being at like 600 000 like how do you feel in regards to like playing with format do you feel like you can for me so yes I feel like I can and I just have to be okay with some months I'm gonna have really high engagement and really high virality and some months I'm gonna have really low it's just me in real time exploring my interests I'm not a robot I'm able to new ideas I'm trying to add to the conversation versus curate I think what's really underrated as for entrepreneurs in general is just to have fun with what you're doing because if you follow the fun good things will happen and you can't take yourself too seriously I love that and I think it's like it's the hell it's a healthy approach too and and with that like Risk like you you have to be okay with you know the numbers going slightly down and then people kind of getting used to you doing things in a slightly different way and then they go back up but it's like uh you know when you play the long game all you have to do to be successful is just not stop I've seen so many writers just kind of like get burned out by the social media aspect of it and and they just disappear they just like stop you know they stop posting and they kind of close that part of themselves yeah you gotta trust the process so I spoke to an entrepreneur the other day one of the most talented designers I know Creator slash entrepreneur he's actually selling you know he ended up raising a ton of money selling his company but he's not going to end up with much from it so he was a bit down down on himself and I was like dude don't be down on yourself you're like 23 you're so talented all you gotta do is just show up like and you don't even need to show up seven days a week like you can show up four days a week literally and you're gonna be A-Okay and and he was like yeah just like I wish I got like a few more million dollars from this deal no no and I was like you will not have to worry about money just create and and stay healthy and you can learn from your mistakes I want to end up on meditation because I know that's that's core to to who you are and I honestly don't know what meditation really is can you define what meditation is I can Define it in the terms that I know um so there's a lot in different meditation Styles will have different goals especially if a person and meditation that I do it's it's definitely a high spiritual path that's supposed to lead out of suffering to get there it's really just a mental gym there are qualities that your mind has specifically qualities of awareness non-reactiveness and um compassion that are ingrained in your mind but they're not strong they're they're quite weak and when you go to these silent 10-day meditation courses um and I'm talking about the ones in the snoenka tradition uh you spend three days just building your awareness and that's you do that by being aware of the natural breath just to just stay with the natural breath and be with it and um and that will help calm and concentrate the mind and that really will strengthen your awareness the next part is where for the next seven days you start being aware of the truth that exists in the body by literally paying attention to all the sensations that are happening in you and that will help uh build this quality of equanimity which I'm using the synonym non-reactiveness uh really balance of mind and ultimately that helps not only purify the mind but it helps just clear the mind incredibly well so that you know whatever situation comes up you'll know what the right action is to take um and lastly you build that quality of compassion of Selfless Love of you know um of loving kindness where you you know you want what's best for yourself and for other people and um and that becomes a lot easier with a with a pure mind and but I really think of meditation as a mental gym it's like you're you know you gotta strengthen your mind because the the mind can do a ton of amazing things but most of those things are based around simply intellectualizing but if you want peace if you want Clarity if you want compassion um if you want like a higher Discerning capacity then you have to cultivate that and if you if you want to learn this skill is the best way to do it to go to one of these Retreats it depends on your on your capacity it depends on like there's like a lot of factors there are a bunch of different apps that will teach you know basic forms of meditation um but if you want to really dig deep if you want to go serious if you want to sort of take yourself to that next level then I definitely recommend doing a retreat um and there are you know a lot of different styles of opposite as well so you kind of have to just find what works for you but I found like I meditate in the same tradition as you all know Harare and those those like you know 10-day courses will eventually build into like 20 30 45 60 day long meditation courses and they're incredibly powerful even you've all said it which I thought was really interesting because him and I we actually have never we've never spoken um but he said he would not have been able to write sapiens without meditation and and it's funny because I didn't even discover that I was a writer until I started meditating like meditating did something to my mind just like kind of realigned it really well so that I could produce creativity and um that literally wasn't possible before meditating how do I find one of these Retreats um you go to dhamma.org d-h-a-m-m-a dot org and uh there are meditation centers in this same style all over the world and um yeah you can just sign up to one I'm checking it out I'm actually going to Japan for a month so maybe they have one in Japan I wonder they do yeah they have a center there Diego this has been an absolute privilege and pleasure uh if people want to follow you and follow your sub stack where could they go young pueblo.substack.com and uh young is spelled without the O in it y-u-n-g-p-u-e-b-l-o you can definitely find me on Instagram or on X on threads you know um and my books are in bookstores everywhere the newest one is called the way forward and that one's available for pre-order now it'll be in your favorite airport too all right thanks again

do these posts look familiar to you unless you're living under a rock you probably have seen one of these photos what's super not known though is these Graphics pave the way for this Creator to print a seven figure business and it all happened within 18 months want to know how he did it my name is Greg Eisenberg and in this video I'm going to break down how one man Jack butcher was able to build a multi-million dollar business and how you or anyone in the world could do the same let's get started the story of Jack butcher is a testament to the power of the internet and the times that we live in today the old way of doing business with buying attention on places like television classified ads radio it was all designed to interrupt you but that's a thing of the past the new way of doing business is what I call the ACP funnel that stands for audience community and product if you want to know more about the ACP funnel I created a whole other video explaining it in depth with a Creator called Thomas Frank who's made millions of dollars using this exact Playbook you can check that out for more context but if Thomas Frank's Effectiveness wasn't enough to convince you of the effectiveness of the ACP funnel let's take a look on how Jack butcher used the exact same Playbook to make a hundred and eighty thousand dollars a month in Revenue with his online business stage one audience after years of working at different design agencies in New York City where he got to work with big names like Ralph Lauren Jack decided it was time to build his own thing that's when he started an agency called opponent visualize value his seven figure business was actually the brainchild of opponents lead gen system Jack started to share on X Formerly Known Twitter these minimalist black and white Graphics he did for clients as a way to drive demand towards his main agency but Jack's content wasn't getting enough traction and the reason for this was the subjects of much of these Graphics were well pretty boring I don't know about you but no matter how good a supply chain Logistics Graphics looks chances are I'm not sharing it so Jack noticed this and stopped sharing client work that stuff was not working and then created Graphics that explain these business and philosophical Concepts which were way more likely to drive engagement on X he was neither a philosopher or business Expert himself so how is he going to come up with all these ideas for Content that's when he came up with a genius tag stick called permissionless Apprentice Jack took existing Concepts from Big names like Naval ravacant and explain them using his unique graphic style soon the likes the retweets they just came pouring in he borrowed naval's credibility and married it with the beauty of his Unique Designs which led him to build a big audience stage two community Jack's audience was not only stoked about all the incredible Graphics he was putting out but also the quantity of the graphics he was putting out 10 to 12 Graphics per day because of that his audience naturally began to ask him how the hell he manages all his time now if there's one thing people love it's a proven step-by-step DIY system that they could follow so Jack developed a system called The Daily manifest which he used to structure his day so he packaged it up and turned it into a 19 PDF available for purchase that was his first product but the dollars he earned wasn't the only thing he benefited from in that transaction every person who bought the daily manifest was added to his digital community so now the second stage of the ACP funnel was complete stage three product at this point a guy in Austin Texas by the name of David perrell a well-known writer who is part of Jack's Community made a tweet that completely changed the course of his business he said I would love to learn how to design like visualize value and he bet that a lot of other people were willing to pay for it if he was so Jack jumps into the comments and asks his community is this something that they'd be interested in the likes and replies start rolling in his audience was telling him exactly what they wanted from visualized value the exact problems that they are struggling with rather than wondering what product he can make Jack had a community who were already invested and who he can listen to and engage with to get ideas [Music] Jack knew exactly what his community's problems were and how to solve them all he needed to do was build that product that would solve their pains in the following months Jack created a course called build one sell twice and his digital products were hitting a hundred and eighty thousand dollars of Revenue per month and by the way the margins were probably 99 you gotta love community-based products because he didn't need to spend a lot of time or spend a lot of money marketing his course because he had the buy-in from the community from day one [Music] and that's the story of how Jack butcher built his seven-figure annual business by leveraging the power of online communities or in other words by leveraging the ACP funnel he chose a format built an audience designed a community for that audience and gave them the product they needed to achieve their goals of course the story didn't end with one product Jack's understanding of his community meant that he could continue to innovate and expand today there's multiple courses that Jack has for different needs different tools to help individuals or businesses visualize their ideas and merchandise and nfts for his community from those simple black and white Graphics to a multi-faceted business Empire without having to raise a single dollar from Venture capitalists Jack's journey is a testament to the power of the ACP funnel it's about more than just business it's about understanding it's it's about evolving it's about thriving with your community and you can do it too just be loud on the internet create a design format that works for you become a permissionless Apprentice build that Community listen and engage with them and build that product that is going to solve their needs thank you so much for watching let me know what you think in the comments below bye foreign [Music]

Title: The Power Of Small Steps

Description:
https://www.youtube.com/@GregIsenberg

Every big achievement often has its roots in tasks that seemed inconsequential at first. 

It's easy to dismiss small efforts as insignificant or lacking impact. 

However, when viewed with a broader perspective, it becomes clear that these tasks often compound, laying the foundation for more substantial work.

Imagine motivation as a battery. 

At full charge, it powers your drive, creativity, and focus. But with time and exertion, it depletes. 

When this happens, social and cultural events are the perfect charging stations. 

Recognizing when you need that recharge and aligning it with significant events is a game-changer in maintaining consistent productivity.

When it comes to networking, there's magic in timing. 

While the idea of "just showing up" holds merit, aligning your visit with major events can increase your chances of building meaningful connections.  

Whether you're looking to connect with mentors or have a business discussion, leveraging cultural events can be the game-changer you've been looking for.

the whole just show up where things are happening other people are more prone and open to meeting and engaging so there's always something to be done for me and probably you in La there's always some sort of business deal or something we can accomplish if we visit there but the pretense of it being a major cultural event I think people are more apt to meet with you or get that coffee whereas like if you just show up randomly January 21st for no other reason but if you're there and other people are there for an event and everyone's already in that mode you're more likely to be able to sit down with folks you aspirationally wanted to sit down with or needed a book time with

Description:
https://www.youtube.com/@GregIsenberg

While there are unavoidable responsibilities in life, it's essential to discern between tasks we think we "should" do and those we genuinely have to do. 

Engaging in a mindful conversation with yourself can help differentiate between perceived obligations and real ones. 

By reassessing the reasons behind each commitment, we can live a life more aligned with authenticity and true purpose.

hey friends welcome back to the channel my name is Greg Eisenberg and in this video I'm going to teach you how to become a multipreneur and how you can build your very own business Empire watch into the end and I can tell you what this all means and how you can do it yourself I run an 8figure hold code called lay checkout and it's been a pretty amazing experience to see what multipreneur could do it's made me realize that multi preneurship is the future of Entrepreneurship as a multipreneur you can make multiple bets per year stay creative lead operate with low overhead and integrate each of your products together plus you get the freedom to work where you want when you want I'm personally recording this Lakeside and I'm loving it so let's get to [Music] it in the early days of Entrepreneurship the Mantra was always go big or go home your location was key to your success want to make it in Tech you best be in Silicon Valley into Finance get your your butt to Wall Street aspiring actor Hollywood is calling your name where you were was just as important as what you were doing however nowadays it's a completely different environment we've shifted gears into this era of multipreneur it's a shift from traditional Venture Capital to something that I call Venture Community VC to VC a multipreneur is someone who creates multiple products per year with the aim of creating a company that creates companies for 20 years Venture Studios and product Studios had their Spotlight pumping out startups that were Venture backed like an assembly line companies like hems and snowflake which is a $30 billion company are great examples of that but today the landscape has changed dramatically the rise of community- based products and these Ai and no code tools just makes it easier to find customers and easier to build stuff which means that you can build multiple things per year here and you don't need these massive teams or to raise millions of dollars of fundraising to build your minimal viable product so if you're interested in being a 21st century multipreneur keep watching let's put some clarity on the board a multipreneur isn't just a beefed up solopreneur trying to juggle five plus businesses alone is pretty much like playing dodgeball except you're having a dozen balls just coming through your face while you're playing it ain't easy imagine the first time your customer service inbox lights up like a Christmas tree you are toast being a multipreneur is about building these small capable teams for each Venture fine-tuning your game as you progress it's not about going at it alone it's about leading a pack so let's break down the four steps so that you can become a multipreneur too step one write your product thesis ask yourself what do you stand for I'll give you an example at lay checkout the company I run we stand for community-based products so we start every business by creating a community and monetizing by Building Products that serve that Community Define who you are and why you exist creating a clear and compelling product thesis is essential to guide your new company by aligning your needs with the vision of your community you're more likely to create products that are going to resonate with your target audience so that's my product thesis but what's yours you need to have a really good answer to why you exist before moving on to step two step two is about writing your operating thesis determine the constraints of your business what's the philosophy around Building Products in your multipreneur Empire it could be launching a new product every single month using AI using no code tools or having each specific product be be an upsell to another product I like to set 5 to 10 constraints of how my company is going to run set 5 to 10 constraints of how your company will run by defining your operating thesis you establish the guidelines for your Ventures operations this keeps you focused this increases efficiency this gives you a clear road map of your team's actions and this is really important because in a multipreneur world you could be focused on anything so you need to focus more step three write your growth thesis you need an unfair advantage to grow there's just too much competition out there not to have one when I launched my design Agency for community- based products in 2020 I had about 10,000 Twitter followers but they weren't just any Twitter followers these were people who were interested in community- based products they were Executives at companies they were building their own startups in the space they needed help consider the social accounts that you're going to start on what's your approach to Growing these accounts are you going to use paid advertising identify your unfair advantage on social media and integrate it into the incubation of each business your growth thesis sets the stage for promoting your products effectively this is going to be key to gaining traction and any of your multipreneur efforts last but not least step four build your team assembling the right team is so crucial multipreneur can't go at it alone one person running multiple agencies is impossible it would be like ice skating while cooking a spicy rigoni dish I don't know how you can do it also not just one person could have all that expertise to run those businesses you need expert to understand operations marketing development product the list goes on and on so the question is this who are the people that are going to build and operate these businesses determine the balance between contractors agencies full-time employees the good news is you can hire anyone today all across the world and you can use AI to increase efficiency so finding the right people is easier now than ever before what makes successful multi preneurs is really their teams so this step is really really crucial having capable teams will let you sleep well at night by having the right people in play you ensure that each venture has the expertise and attention it needs to thrive and there you have it folks the exciting world of multipreneur so if you're tired of the old rule book and want to create your own business Empires multi preneurship might be right for you you don't need to go big or go home anymore you can go big from home if this video got you thinking subscribe to my Channel

ironically what I still see as the biggest issue for most creators who enter my world it's not creating good work and it's often not even just getting attention to their work a lot of them don't know how to turn that attention into a business they have like a really I guess immature view as in like it hasn't been fleshed out of what like a revenue model looks like how they actually turn this into a business and a lot of times they come in and they think that attention is sold to advertisers and that's kind of it so a lot of folks that have entered my world I've helped them on the revenue side building out okay what what levers do I pull so that I am financially rewarded for the work that I'm doing Jay it's it's been uh it's been a while last time I don't know if you remember the last and and only time we've hung out in the maven accelerator and the maven accelerator oh yeah I remember I have a great memory yeah so what do you remember about that time uh it was it was fun I mean I'm involved in Maven in a in a small investment capacity you might be as well so I'm rooting for for them and I think that cohort based courses are really interesting part of like the product um like product development for creators I think like the natural way things go oftentimes is I have an idea I want to serve this audience and now I tell people before you do like a self-based course you should do a cohort based version of it because the the price is higher you get much better feedback you can triage issues that come up so you get better student outcomes earlier on so I thought it was awesome and I really liked the Frameworks they taught us there I've actually reached out to them I want to relearn the Frameworks they had for cbcs because I think they're also great Frameworks for like prescriptive non-fiction books I remember when I was considering creating a cohort based course and yeah we basically we started working my agency late checkout was hired by them to build out their first version and I remember thinking initially like this feels like such a waste of time um to create the the this course and it was this six week accelerator that we did together where they basically taught us how to create a course and it was single-handedly probably one of the greatest things I've done in the last five years because it taught me how to what I liked about it was it forced me this is like Peak covid it forced me to distill all the knowledge I had about building businesses that were powered by Community but basically taking that and putting Frameworks to it so I created about 20 Frameworks 20 different models from that and it was just so valuable yeah yeah having something that kind of forces you well there's like a forcing function for deadlines within that accelerator even running your own program you know like when things are scheduled and live you have to live up to those deadlines and perform that degree but I agree like the the structure they gave us and the way they taught us to Think Through Frameworks Frameworks are so valuable is this something I didn't talked about enough in the world of creators is intellectual property Frameworks methodologies because you do that well you can build a whole business on the back of that because you put the thought into making something great and strong and referable and now suddenly people are spreading your ideas on your behalf you know like there's there's always going to be some um uh 20 year old with a ton of time and a ton of energy who's going to out tweet me or zet me whatever the word is but um they won't always have the experience that you have that you can package into IP but now they proliferate on your behalf and so that's like The Wonder of the maven accelerator I guess totally yeah it's like Jack butcher has this great saying build once sell twice yeah and that's related to products and and you know create a product basically and and sell it multiple times and I think with a framework it's kind of like create once and sell twice right like you're basically creating the framework and it becomes like this idea of Iris that people can now share with other people and as long as the framework has to do with the core thing that you're trying to get across I guess is the caveat for sure well and it's it's it's a shared vocabulary you know even lesser self Wes the co-founder of Maven she has this great blog post called spiky point of view and I referenced that all the time because I think that's becoming prerequisite for creators today is to really have some spiky point of view or some unique premise is is my word for it but the way she wrote that blog post and the way she named it now I have vocabulary to to point to somebody who has a gap in what they're doing and say oh this is what you're missing you're missing this thing called a Specky point of view and now I can name it I can pass that idea on and then it's like if you want to go deeper on this here's a great blog post by Wes so you know I've probably generated as much traffic into that blog post of hers than than she has and that's a wonderful thing like I want people to do that for my writing and for my my work too yeah and it's pretty meta too right like we're we're sitting here we're talking about Wes because of her Frameworks 100 I brought you on here today want to catch up and see how you're doing you look great number one thanks man likewise this has given me a good excuse to break from our uh kitchen renovation right now so I appreciate it okay perfect so I saved you from that well first I want you to explain what you do and then secondly I'd like to explain I'd like for you to explain um how's it going uh well I'm a meta Creator I'm a Creator who creates about creators there's a lot of people like me it's a very red ocean and there's a broad spectrum of uh legitimacy there and I hope that people see me as towards the end of the spectrum of of trustworthy and uh doing good work in this space because there's definitely Bad actors in this space but what I like to do is I like to study uh today's top creators understand what they're doing well why it's working and then translate that to folks who are kind of on the cusp to help them get over that hump um when I realized I'm not really interested in doing is convincing people that they want to be a Creator because in my opinion creators done well done in a way that is professional you have to be an entrepreneur and it's always going to be a minority of the population that is an entrepreneur if you don't have it in you I'm not going to try and convince you that you do because I'm setting you up for a lot of pain so I'm really interested in helping people who have already decided this is the life for me I'm working really hard I'm not quite getting there to push them over the hump because I mean you probably feel this way too there's not really a battery life than doing things on your terms getting your ideas out there being known and respected and sought after for the way you think about things and the art that you make and so that's what I predominantly do with the podcast we're on YouTube it's called Creator science and I get to talk to a lot of great people like you too so it's it's been uh really great in a lot of ways so one of the coolest parts of your job is that you you're helping people transform and as you say like getting from you know basically point A to point B could you tell a few or one story that comes to mind where someone you know someone came into you came into greater science or started listening to you and where you help them get to and and how they became successful and the reason I ask is as a Creator myself I'm always trying to figure out how our creators succeeding you know what are the tools that they're using how are they structuring their content how do they uh you know what are the hacks that they're using so um anything you can share is is helpful I think so let me let me lay out some some Frameworks here that I think are helpful at least in understanding how I view the space so in the Creator economy quote unquote I think it's it's kind of a dichotomy between people on the education side and people on the entertainment side and of course there's some in-between people who are both educational and entertaining but broadly I see that as the dichotomy and the Creator economy space I work with a lot more of folks on the education side people who have some sort of earned Insight some sort of experience and now they're saying I want to teach people who need to learn what I know and I'm trying to build a business on the back of that um ironically what I still see as the biggest issue for most creators who enter my world it's not uh creating good work and it's often not even just getting attention to the work a lot of them don't know how to turn that attention into a business they have like a really I guess immature view as in like it hasn't been fleshed out of what like a revenue model looks like how they actually turn this into a business and a lot of times they come in and they think that attention is sold to advertisers and that's kind of it so a lot of folks that have entered my world I've helped them on the revenue side building out okay what what levers do I pull so that I am financially rewarded for the work that I'm doing um I would say my best and most successful product is my membership Community the lab and in there I've probably helped the most folks with building membership communities of their own as well because that when you get that going well as you well know it's like this very pure um relationship between you and your customers and you're selling directly to your customers it's providing a lot of value to them and my membership Community then is kind of a double dip because not only am I teaching these people how they can build a membership they're seeing literally exactly what I do as well so we've had folks um miles McNair is one that comes to mind who they've built great businesses on SEO they get a ton of traffic uh they're teaching other people SEO and now you know he had a multi five figure launch of his membership Community right out of the gate um another one is Brian Withers he's a part of a team it's actually three Brians they were early Maven instructors as well they have been doing cohort based courses they wanted to get off of the launch cycle to a degree so they launched a private membership and so that's been really really gratifying to see that in that way um but even from a pure process standpoint I like helping people think about their businesses as machines because before there were creators there were already entrepreneurs and the entrepreneur's goal was to say I know how to build something out of nothing and turn that into a machine that generates revenue and over time they often worked themselves out of the business and people think that as a Creator you can't totally do that and I agree you usually can't totally do that but you can do it a lot more than most people seem to think you know you can you can Elevate yourself out of this you can make it so that you know when someone enters into your ecosystem your world they're going to be taken on a customer Journey that introduces them to uh your best free resources then some of your paid offers and you should be able to see in a very small cycle someone enters the front door over here they come out on the other side with their own transformation and value was created value is captured now we're building a business and that's a lot of what I work with people on can you talk more about what a membership Community is you know because I see some people launching courses that look like to me a membership community and then I see some people launching membership communities that sometimes look like courses to me so could you define what that is I look at it as this is a paid subscription product um first and foremost if if that is true then you might have a membership and then generally I say there's another kind of binary system is this a membership that gives me access to premium content or is this a membership that gives me access to a private community and a lot of them have both but even if you do have both in your membership I think you usually lean on one more than the other uh is this a place about peer-to-peer connection or is this a place about content that I can't get unless I'm outside of these Gates um so that's that's usually what I work with folks on and usually the memberships that I help people with are predicated more on the peer-to-peer connection side um and a lot of times that's augmented with some sort of Premium content but when I see a lot of memberships that are um predicated on premium content also tend to be lower priced from what I see and the folks that come in I like to say hey if you are able to create this very rare scarce space where a very select exclusive group of people get together to meet other people like them that's valued really highly you can design this in such a way that it compensates you well for the time and effort you're putting into it and people have a really great experience so there's there's a huge spectrum of what membership communities look like from the price point from the experience but generally I would say they either fall on the side of the spectrum of peer-to-peer connectivity or uh premium content and with your with the lab and specifically what are the price points and how many people are taking it and how much revenue does that bring in I've taken some interesting design choices with the lab we have 200 members because that is the cap that I put on it when we got to be about 50 members I said I'm actually going to keep this at 200 people um so we we hit that 200 member cap at uh in February of this year there were two tiers of membership there was a standard tier which was Community Access and access to all the courses then there was a VIP tier which was the standard tier plus a quarterly one-on-one call with me the standard tier is priced at 19.99 and the VIP tier is priced at 29.99 so that part of the lab when you say 1999 you mean 1999 correct correct yes correct it's annual only it's capped it's relatively high priced um so with those two tiers of membership the community was on a trajectory of about four hundred thousand dollars in ARR um once we did hit that cap I opened up a lower tier of membership that gave access to the educational materials only so they don't have access to the Forum or direct messages but they can get all my courses all my workshops all the ongoing stuff I make I do like a monthly retro behind the scenes literally breaking down my own profit and loss reflecting on the goals that I had that month what went well what didn't go well so it's like this 30 minute very transparent look at my business um we do basically internal cohort based courses in the community I call them shared Focus Sprints and the videos of those courses the structure of those courses that gets recorded and put in for uh the lower tier of membership so that's fairly new and we have three or four dozen folks in that membership as well so all in all we're on a trajectory of getting close to 500 000 in ARR which is pretty insane given you started this how long ago March of 2022. yeah so the reason I wanted to bring you on is I think your probably one of the probably one of the people that do these membership based uh experiences so thoughtfully so everything about your uh how you operate is really smart so I think the cap is really smart I think how you're doing those Sprints is really smart I think the fact that you're doing workshops is really smart even your welcome newsletter I recently signed up to your newsletter and your welcome newsletter was like the Mona Lisa of welcome newsletters I was like this is amazing and I think people are sleeping on membership they're sleeping on yeah I think they're sleeping on it and I think especially for B2B where if you can you know as you say like if you can show people and and add value hey come come to this experience and you're going to come out of this experience with a ton of value and you just have to give me a couple random you know a year which is that's when people are like yeah no-brainer if if that's the case right if you can actually do it right it depends a little bit on your audience you know there there are um niches we'll call them who just don't have as much disposable income so my style of membership might not fit in that world there are also niches where you could take the exact thing I'm doing double or triple the price and they wouldn't blink an eye you know so it depends a little bit on your on your audience um the the 200 cap is fairly arbitrary that just felt like based on the experience that I designed what I could sustain myself without bringing in like a community manager or kind of change the expectation of what the community looked like you know I've been I've been a part of a lot of memberships now um personally building them or running them and there's an interesting relationship to scale with with memberships where at a certain point if this is based on peer-to-peer connectivity you actually have to fight against the success of the product because huge numbers changes the experience for members who were there early um and it becomes more difficult for you to manage so I just decided I was not going to set this up in a way where I had to fight that fight and that played a role in how I chose the pricing in the beginning too because I thought okay if all if I'm going to limit this somewhere you know what price makes me feel excited to continue working on this as the business grows as I get more successful outside of the membership you know and I appreciate you saying that about the the intentionality because I see every touch point that I have with my customers or subscribers you know future customers every touch point is an opportunity for thought and design and I just like really find joy in doing unique things in that process can you talk more about your top of the funnel strategy so uh how are you thinking about of course you're capped right now but I imagine you're going to have new products and maybe open up that cap in the future how do you think about attracting audience and then converting those into you know paying customers yeah I I look at it now as well I think as a Creator there are two types of platforms you can be creating on we call them Discovery platforms and relationship platforms Discovery platforms have built-in Discovery mechanisms to the platform uh social media YouTube search engines these platforms these machines are incentivized to introduce new viewers to your content because because they're ad supported and it keeps them on platform relationship platforms you own that distribution it's email it's podcasting it's SMS and it's private communities and so my strategy is to top a funnel is the Discovery platform but I very quickly as quickly as I can once I get them into my relationship platform my main relationship platform which is email and then I actually tried to grow the email to push people towards the podcast that's like at the bottom of my platform funnel if you will so increasingly in the discovery uh platform part of my business I'm actually leaning on YouTube more I'm finding that YouTube is becoming one of the largest sources of new audience because YouTube has an incredible algorithm we've started to find like good content Market fit with our podcasts on YouTube and they're really high quality which is awesome um and so YouTube both gets people into email even though there's not a great pathway for that and it introduces people to the audio podcast because we produce one video episode for every two or three audio episodes that we put out so that's basically the strategy is be a public loudmouth on social media and on YouTube and try to get people to email so I just hit 10 000 YouTube subscribers today dude congrats and thank you and I think it I think it has been the hardest platform for me to grow ever more than audio more than audio yes that's right crazy I find audio to be way harder than YouTube You're yeah tell me more about that why is that just from the discoverability standpoint yeah there's there's no discoverability and like they're really the best way to grow audio listeners is either to have a massive top of funnel elsewhere already or um to get on other podcasts or do cross promotions like you really only convert existing audio listeners to audio listeners of your show and it's it's difficult to get in front of existing audio listeners um but if you have like a big top of funnel you have you have a really large Twitter audience so I imagine that you're able to pull a significant number of people from Twitter into the show which was a benefit that I did not have when I started the show three years ago I think the benefit I had was I started podcasting in 2021 and when I started I basically like I went on my first million I went on the Anthony pompiano show yep uh yeah that'll do it it it just like all at the same time and then Twitter you know you know you start posting about it on Twitter and we had these like highly produced videos and stuff like that and from there a lot of people have just stuck around yeah and with YouTube because I was so late I think um late in the game like I just started posting like I see on your channel you you've got your long form but you've also got your short form and like I see you with these thumbnails like I'm looking at your thumbnail right now with a coffee cup against your head like you're doing the the YouTube game you gotta do it you got if any game any game that you choose to play like you've got to do that game or you're not gonna win the game um we do shorts and clips much less than we used to now because um YouTube's getting better at tying a short audience to your channel but that doesn't mean that that changes user Behavior like I find that most shorts viewers just aren't interested in long form and so it's not that YouTube isn't making it easy for them to do that it's just that that's not what the user behavior is and so we're a pretty small team you know we have one on uh one video editor so at one point we just decided like hey let's put all of our capacity into making the long form videos just really good and working on packaging and planning the pipeline where we're really focused on that right now but it took a while like we we we've more than doubled our channel in the last two months Max um but the crazy thing is like you have one video do really well if the bat catalog is good it just gives the back catalog new life when one video does well and that does not happen in audio that's the secret that people don't talk about in social media which is most followings come from a very small amount of posts going Mega viral totally totally like it's it's really about a home run like you just need a home run and I remember when this happened so in 2020 2020 I think yeah it was in 2020 I got I posted a thread on Twitter and it got 55 000 likes and Nick Huber sweaty startup sent me a send me a text message and he says he says Greg you're not gonna really understand this right now but this tweet will change your life and I remember thinking like this guy's crazy what is he talking about I got 50 or 60 000 followers in 24 hours nuts yeah that's nuts nuts and he was right it did change my life because all of a sudden I had this group of people who started to really trust me and then from that it evolved and and it's been really great ever since and I think the same is probably true with YouTube where you just need a few hits like it has there been a video over the last couple months that has really hit it for you oh yeah yeah which videos just two videos there's two videos in a row one was um an interview with Patty Galloway who's one of the most sought after YouTube Consultants out there and then the next video was with Ed his channel is called film booth on YouTube he has just a very uh tight fan base as well and so those two videos back to back just really grew the channel significantly um and they continue to perform really really well so one thing we've learned though well as you can probably attest if your channel is predicated on long form interviews that's just not the typical YouTube video that's playing YouTube on hard mode as it is yeah that that's that's challenging all on its own but then packaging has to be even better in my opinion because that is so hard so we've had to put way more time into packaging and part of packaging is your guest so we've even started to tailor the show a little bit to be successful on YouTube and if if we don't think that the guest will have significant pull with a unknown you know to a new viewer on YouTube we don't make a video episode out of it um we basically make it Audio Only and then save our resources for video specific creators I kind of hate that like I hate it because I'll tell you why I hit it and then before before you react so a while ago when this when this podcast first started we only interviewed top people if they didn't have hundreds of thousands of followers they were not interviewed on the show basically and I didn't like that because I thought the show was about having really interesting conversations with just community at the core of it but Community can mean a lot of different things to a lot of different people could be you know you throw events or maybe you're a burst on a coffee shop or maybe you're you and you're building on these membership sites and I got to a point where I was basically burnt out with these guests and I felt that I wasn't giving a chance to these smaller guests so for the last year or 18 months even uh yeah 12 to 18 months I've been doing a mix of guests like you who have an audience and people who who don't have audiences or have small audiences and what I like about it is okay maybe so my question to you actually this is feedback for me I'm like am I making the wrong decision by by dedicating resources to the to these things and my reaction to you is why don't you do more under the radar type interviews well it's I don't think you're making a quote unquote wrong decision and when I talk about the guests needing to make sense for video a couple of our most popular videos our most recent episode is with George Blackman I don't think people know his name I don't think people know his face but he is a scriptwriter for some top YouTubers so we were able to pull that into the packaging um so he's not a big name he's not a big audience but we knew that video would be interesting to a YouTube audience uh same with Jake Thomas who does incredible research in the world of what makes great YouTube titles again people wouldn't know his name people wouldn't know his face but YouTube titles that's a package that would work well on YouTube um I don't think there's anything wrong with having people who might not be as much of a clear home run on YouTube and putting them on the channel we've had some episodes in the past with Mariah cause or Brian Harris these people are really thoughtful and well known in the world of online courses which on the recommended page of of views but they do have longer average view durations in the the comments we get are incredible so I do want to put more of those videos on the channel but it's just a question of prioritization in resources because I make a pretty hefty investment and each of the videos we put on the channel and so at this phase where we are just trying to get the channel name out there and get in front of new viewers I want to put my best foot forward with the investment that I'm making I'm still having conversations with folks who really span the gamut of the Creator economy but mostly just end up in audio we're publishing an audio episode every week we publish a video episode twice a month Max so it's just prioritization most of it most of it yeah have you read Rick rubin's latest book creative act I think halfway through he talks about being a distributor versus being like a artist basically and he talks about if you're a distributor that means you find out what people want and you create the thing and you distribute the thing that people want and if you're an artist you you craft the thing that you want for you and then you hope that others yeah like yeah the question is where should you sit on on the spectrum is what he brings up I'm closer to the edge of distributor but then I say okay within the constraints of being a distributor how can I make this as uniquely me as possible and I think as time passes I will slide down the Spectrum to the other end because you kind of earn the right to do your own thing and listen to your own taste if you have Financial constraints you know if you are working at nine to five and you're happy with that nine to five and you want to make whatever you want to make just because you want to make it and you don't have intentions on that replacing your income on any particular time frame then you should set as far on the side of artists as you want and make whatever you want but if you have Financial constraints and you want this thing to be a viable business on some predictable time frame I think you need to lean into being a distributor because businesses are built on creating value for people so you have to understand what people want value from otherwise is a little bit like a slot machine yeah I would also I would also argue that and I wish Rick would would have said this in in the book but it's often not about Distributing to what people want but it's Distributing what the algorithm wants right so you're not just trying to please people you're trying to please an algorithm well and that's that's if your strategy really weighs on the Discovery platform side right um for a long time I just didn't do Discovery platforms at all to my detriment like it took me way too long to realize ah I should actually prioritize more time creating on social media instead of just doing email because the best way to grow an email list is not by writing great emails unfortunately like it's by getting top of funnel elsewhere introducing them to the point to the fact that you have have email because if you are really predicated on the Discovery platforms you do have to play towards what's working there you know what how is the game being played you're just not gonna win on Instagram if you're not doing reels right now you know yeah and it's even uh more specific than that like there's a specific type of real that you need to do right now and there's a specific type of Trends following the trend yeah knowing knowing how to hook people in the first three seconds knowing how to end a reel so that it Loops like every game has games within the game yeah and if you want to win the macro game you've gotta you've got to learn the micro games and it becomes exhausting it's really hard to like win the micro games of multiple macro games that's why it's hard to be successful on Instagram and Twitter simultaneously are you are you more tired now than or more energized now than you were let's say when you were running a startup a few years ago oh yes if we're comparing it to my startup times one you're more energized I don't think yeah I don't think I'll ever go back to like the quote-unquote startup world that doesn't mean that I wouldn't dip my toes into building like a software company at some point but you know I think even the word like startup often gets sucked into the scene of what being a startup founder is and I'm not really interested in that that scene or that game but you know I am interested in continuing to build strong businesses and if I see an opportunity in software in the realm that I'm playing in I would do that but I I have no interest really in doing like The Venture Capital path again um yeah I would probably bootstrap or do some other type of creative financing or really focus on just a couple of angels if I really needed capital for some reason but you know building building a business as a Creator the economics get pretty crazy pretty quickly and you have a lot of optionality to invest in your in yourself in your own projects yeah I mean if you're making five hundred thousand dollars of Revenue I imagine the margins on that are like 90 plus percent or 85 for sure yeah they're yeah they're they're really high and that's just one product you know granted the membership is about 70 of My overall Revenue but it's not my only Revenue uh so it's it the economics get pretty crazy pretty quickly yeah and I think a lot of creators are gonna you know years ago it was kind of like you either raise venture or you there was no other option actually you kind of just had to raise Venture and do the whole Venture thing now there's some so many options and I think creators are seeing so much success doing their own thing going D to C direct to community as I call it and yeah I'm wondering do you have any examples of creators that you look up to that have really awesome businesses oh tons um my friend Daphne she has a business called teacher career coach she helps burned out teachers explore opportunities outside of the classroom in what I really what blows my mind about Daphne's business she's she's kind of showed me under the hood a couple of times including like her convert kit subscriber graph it's the most violent up and to the right graph I've ever seen in the Creator space and it's because just like anything else if you have product Market fit and good timing like things can just go so well for you so quickly so I admire her for that because she's like genuinely helping a lot of people and she's handled like Market driven scale in a really impressive way I really personally aspire to the lives and businesses of authors more than anything else because they're they're able to like spend a lot of time investing into making this one really great long-form product and build really lean businesses on the back of that Todd Henry's a great example of this he writes a book and publishes like every two years or Dan pink uh James Clear he only has the one book obviously but it's such a huge ridiculous success so I really aspire to that life because you can probably relate to this Greg like when when you are playing the social media game as part of your top of funnel that's that becomes a lot of production on its own let alone whatever that is moving towards so you get in this place where it's like I am creating so much all the time just to remain in people's line of sight because that's the economics of how the business works I would love to pull back for months work on something much bigger much crazier much more enduring than this tweet and have that be the engine for the business you know that that would be just awesome but you when you get yourself on that that treadmill you have to buy yourself the time back to do the larger thing so those are just a couple examples but there are so many creators some podcasters too like a great podcast the folks who do acquired Ben and um David uh I went to college with Ben that's an incredible business that also really opened my eyes to you can have a large audience of very influential very accomplished people you know in a vacuum pre-acquired I would have said the audience of the show seems really small and yeah those people are valuable but it seems really small I think they have on there about Paige that they get uh 150 000 downloads per month or something ridiculous and all of their listeners are like Founders VCS really um intense people so that's an oh no 300 000 unique listeners crazy so that's a few examples I also think we've just become numb to numbers like you can't spell numbers or the num that's funny because especially I think Twitter slash X has done this to us when they put the Impressions on each tweet and now we're like okay how many likes did it get how many retweets did it get how many bookmarks did it get how many Impressions did it get and Impressions you know I always say Chase impact not impressions and I say that because well first of all I think you can get a lot of Impressions but not make an impact but also I have to you know just remind myself that these are real people like 350 000 people like that's literally like 10 Arenas no it's more it's like crazy 20 Arena stadiums you know it's crazy yeah there was a time before before we hit the cap on the lab uh membership wasn't two thousand dollars is fifteen hundred dollars when we hit the cap I increased uh the price for new members um but at that time I knew you know if I tweeted once a week or twice a week about the community it would be my lowest engagement tweet but it would result in a new member and so I just looked at this as like I don't even care the spread on this this is worth saying this is worth sharing and it's gonna have a meaningful impact on the business you know I it wasn't a 200 like tweet but it was probably a 1500 tweet like that's that's a worthwhile way of using the tool even if from the outset it's like oh that tweet bombed in a way sure uh in another way all the other tweets are bombing actually well it depends what you're optimizing for so I think when you're creating content the question you need to ask yourself is what am I optimizing for and I think that could be different each week each day each month you know I think to you at that point it was my goal is to get 200 people into this into this group and totally that's all you know and then after you did that you might have been like okay back to regular scheduled programming let's go yeah you know yep and I think totally the other thing is you know I look at these platforms these social platforms as a way just to build trust with people you know you're building trust You're Building trust and a certain point you want a cat you might want to cash in on that trust in some shape or form it's just a it's just a question to ask yourself which is when makes the most sense to cash in on that trust so it is is social media for you top of funnel for late checkout is that are you trying to get clients from social media I mean your strategy look like that you know I joined Twitter in 2000 and I don't know it says on my profile or used to say on my profile right 2008. and I've been tweeting about the same stuff since 2008 at the same velocity so I initially I'm on social media to get my ideas out there first and foremost and to attract interesting people like you and I've had crazy people crazy conversations with people from Twitter so that's my number one reason why I'm on Twitter and why I do social media what sort of retention do you see in the best performing versus worst performing membership I don't have a ton of data here I know that my retention is over 90 uh like most months the first four months when I was really looking at it it was above 94 percent um so that's the best I've seen but I know that most memberships that I talk to are pretty static because they're bringing new people in every month but they're losing just as many people as they're gaining so you know by that logic it would be like 50 right um if it's less than 50 you have a real problem because you're shrinking actively yeah but even if you're not shrinking actively churn is such a dangerous thing because there are negative Network effects in a peer-to-peer based membership where if my friends are leaving why would I stick around if I don't feel close to people who are joining because we have just as many people joining us leaving it just feels like the party is turning over all the time and I don't feel comfortable in this space anymore so I think more memberships should uh focus on larger renewal timelines or larger commitments like I think a monthly membership and a peer-to-peer based Community is a bad idea um you'll have to do annual you could do bi-annual you could do quarterly but I think monthly memberships in a peer-to-peer based space is setting yourself up for failure yeah I think I think retention is the golden metric of if you have a good membership and if you feel like your retention is low then that is a signal to focus on investing in the experience and making it more retentive because it's it's better to make the product more retentive than to try to just make your top of funnel better to get more people in totally and that sometimes could mean you need a part-time or full-time Community manager that's their only focus is retention so for example have them create programming social events things like that that bring people together in your membership and you just look and you speak to that person you're like hey retention's at 50 you need to get to 70 percent and a lot of these events and programming actually helps increase that so you can look at it after 90 days or 120 days and be like is this working are we you know are we moving in the right direction for sure I think the larger your community grows the more you need to think about the community as a set of concentric circles where people will want varying degrees of closeness with smaller and smaller groups like if I am in a 1 000 person community but I value the ability to have a consistent small group interaction you should be trying to facilitate that in some way to make that experience something that can be formed it might take a little bit of work on the part of the members themselves but you can do to kind of meet them there and make that experience possible that's when scale is not a problem when you're able to continue to create close experiences in small groups then scale is is a good thing for the business but a lot of people have this membership that starts off really small and people have these great intimate small group experiences they're successful in getting more members in they don't facilitate continuing those experiences and it just becomes a different experience with the membership I don't feel that closeness anymore and that's when it starts to work against you we're running up on time but I have one last question and putting you a little bit on the spot but you're a smart guy you know if you weren't doing what you're doing now what is a business that you might start or where do you see a trend or some opportunities uh that you're just like if I only had more time I would do that in this space I think there is room for a an agency that is of fractional Community managers because there are a ton of people who are able to build and grow communities they don't want to do active management of it they don't want to hire maybe can't hire a full-time employee but also if you have a team of fractional Community managers that can be a small group of fire starters within each community that you guys take on as a client to get things kind of moving I just think it's a no-brainer I have no real interest in running an agency so I'm happy to have that out there but I think I'm shocked that this has not come around yet as like a dominant player in that space yeah agency business tough uh as you know but definitely think that if you can keep it small and you're not trying to hire a thousand fractional Community managers there's definitely an opportunity there yeah Jay where could uh it's been fun man yeah where could where could people follow you uh check out the podcast Creator science you can check out everything at creatorscience.com or find me at J Klaus on whatever platform you like to uh hang out on and this is this has been fun you can come come back on the show whenever your heart desires and I'd love to I was hoping to pick up that guitar and play me a song at some point part two part two if people want it comment in the YouTube comment on the YouTube if you want that yes yes let's make this happen should we just turn into a rock band me and you I'll be the vocalist I have no I have no instrumental ability but I I have no vocals pretend to sing I Love karaoke I Love karaoke later man

Title: Is Solopreneurship As Good As It Sounds?
Published: 2023-09-15 13:11:34 UTC
Description:
The rise of one-person businesses — aka solopreneurship — has disrupted the traditional startup model.

In fact, it’s estimated that 80% of the 24 million small businesses in the United States are run by solopreneurs.

Freedom, control, flexibility — these are just some of the reasons behind the rise in popularity of this business model.

…Or at least, that’s the canned response of the average solopreneur.

However, in the past few years, more and more solopreneurs have been reporting feelings of loneliness and isolation in their work.

Is it possible that there’s a downside to this business model that the leading advocators are not willing to admit?

In this video, we’ll dive into the realities of navigating solopreneurship in 2023 and what one-person businesses can do to overcome these challenges.

heads up if you're a solopreneur this video might be triggering solopreneurs you've probably seen them online preaching 24 7 about their job you know being a one-man Army earning a gazillion dollars while working from their laptop in their underwear and ending every single day with a massive glass of wine while they watch their zeros and their bank accounts go up sounds pretty dreamy right but if you're thinking this is too good to be true you might be onto something this whole idea of solopreneurship is sold as the best most freeing form of Entrepreneurship there is but there is a downside not many solopreneurs are willing to admit so if one of Justin Welsh's tweets has made you considering getting rid of your whole team and going solo watch this video Until the End you might change your mind and I'll give you a strategy on how to build your own Empire foreign as you've probably noticed the concept of solopreneurship has been gaining tons of traction over the last few years but for those of you who don't know a solopreneur is basically a person who runs a business solo without any team or Partners we could summarize the whole solopreneur philosophy in three steps build an audience launch a product let the cash flow I mentioned Justin Welsh at the beginning because he's a prime example of how solopreneurship Works Justin grew his audience to 400 plus thousand people on LinkedIn then he built a business around it now he teaches people how to become their own solopreneurs grow Their audience and monetize their skills this year Justin will do four million dollars of Revenue with 99 margins which is pretty incredible for a little one-person business and don't get me wrong I love Justin I think he's doing great work and there's no doubt what he has achieved is incredible but I also believe he is like any passionate person about a topic he's focused on one side of the argument maybe he's sharing too much of the upsides so in today's video we're gonna dive into the less pretty side of running a one person business and why it matters to you number one isolation humans are inherently social beings working alone can get seriously lonely many of us lose motivation and it takes a toll on our mental health if you're a solopreneur you're missing out on what your team did last weekend sharing wins and losses brainstorming Solutions which is a pretty big deal number two pressure when you're the sole operator of a business you are the single point of failure everything rests on your shoulders you might be thinking well who cares more money for me but it also means any failure big or small is entirely yours to bear and the business is completely dependent on you this pressure could be emotionally and mentally taxing for solopreneurs number three limited skill set let's be real you can't be an expert in everything a solopreneur might be an incredible product designer but when it comes to sales can't sell anything and even if you're a genius and can Master every single skill you need there's obviously a learning curve involved which could lead to mistakes which could lead to stress and which could slow you down number four it's easy to burn out it goes without saying that handling all aspects of a business can be pretty overwhelming from product development to marketing to customer service and more The Continuous juggling can lead to burnout and crazy long hours at some point you have no option but to delegate if you think about it how many of these self-professed solopreneurs are really just working by themselves I doubt it's many number five no backup being a solopreneur is a really cool until you want to go on vacation if a solopreneur faces a personal emergency needs a vacation gets the flu there's no team member to step in and keep the business going there's only so much you can automate so this lack of backup could completely mess up your operations and lead you to losing money or missing great opportunities it could also add pressure on the solopreneur to avoid breaks or rest when needed if an entrepreneur thinks twice before taking a break a solopreneur definitely thinks Thrice number six potential bias when Abraham Lincoln won the 1860 presidential election the first thing he did was appoint three of his Rivals to join his cabinet people thought he was crazy but I think he had a point having different opinions on your team can actually help you gain perspective and help you make better decisions this lack of diverse perspectives and feedback can sometimes lead to confirmation bias which can hinder Innovation and limit the ability to see potential flaws in decisions or strategies in your business so that's the downsides about being a solopreneur but I think there's one major upside it forces you to pick a niche build an audience build a community and build a product for that Community by the end of that process you will know that Niche and business inside and out so here's what you should do to build your Empire by being a solopreneur start as a solopreneur and end as a multi-preneur someone who creates multiple businesses with multiple operators so you pick a niche you build an audience you build a community you build a product for that Community you get product Market fit once you get product Market fit as a solopreneur you hire yourself out of that role then you pick a niche you build an audience you build a community you build a product for them and you hire yourself out of that role you keep doing it time and time again until you have a portfolio of businesses and operators what's going to happen with many solopreneurs is they're just going to evolve from solopreneurship to multi-preneurship if you want to know more about multi-preneurship check out

a lot of people in Canada they think they know what it's like to run a Silicon Valley business truly they do not they don't know what it's like to have worked at PayPal in 1999. as the economy was crashing they don't know what product Market fit feels like people all over the world read blog posts and Twitter and they take those and they say this is how a startup should be run and because they don't feel that there's a piece that they're missing most people feel like they understand what working at a startup is and what it's like to work in a tech company if they haven't been in one in Silicon Valley they really don't know what it feels like and they don't really know how to work that hard and I don't know what a product Market fit feels like Julian Smith friend of the Pod New York Times best-selling author probably raised a quarter billion dollars you can't see it right now but has more tattoos and I think I have hair welcome back to the show yeah thanks for thanks for having me on I appreciate it and I'm a fan of the show The VC Market is hurting right now especially with B2B businesses you know you have Enterprises just cutting back spend on things like software so I imagine the next wave will be b2c companies once consumers start tightening they're going to be the ones that are hurting it's already happening in Canada I saw an article today saying that the GDP the GDP of Canada is was a surprise and it's actually declining or it's Contracting as long as you don't run out of cash you're doing something smart you've extended your Runway because you're in Canada one US dollar is 135 Canadian so basically if you raised 10 million dollars you now have 13.5 million dollars how has hiring internationally help you run your business first of all I knew from the get-go even in 2019 when we were first ideating on this thing that we wanted to do it remote keep in mind my last company was an office space technology company and so because of that like there was no chance it was not going to be offices and there was no chance it was not going to be an in-person business and the world was different in 2014 to 18 when I was CEO of that thing and and so but I was I was really clear on my boundaries so my boundaries were I cannot be in an office every day and there were a lot of things I didn't like about that and and so I shifted like some of our friends that you know Greg right into a remote business they had a different structure that are really like that really results oriented environments and where people are hired based on Talent not really based on their geography necessarily or in some cases not even necessarily based on a common um native language we could have gotten together in the past either regionally or globally like all as a team and that really helps people gel together uh but I will say that if you know if people like on the internet like Keith Rogue and like other people are telling me to go back to the office legitimate currently like I don't know if maybe they think I'm a shitty operator I don't know I don't think that I'm a shitty operator clearly I've proven some things out at some point and so if if they uh if they want me to return to the office I would legitimately not be a CEO again so this form of collaboration has helped me become an entrepreneur and a better operator and run a business I think everybody needs it's it's running a business need to run it by their own standards and what matters to them and and so they need to run it by their own values right if they're becoming an entrepreneur they need to run it by their own standards of what they want out of the likes right whether they want a quote unquote lifestyle business derogatory term or they want a venture-backed business they need to figure out what it is that they want as an operator and as a founder and then go after that and actually actively exclude other things and so here there is a canada-based portion of my business but over time there was a set of hiring that happened International nationally and I would say it does present its own challenges but it is absolutely worthwhile the way that we've made it work is and the thing that's really mattered for us is we have driven towards a set of leaders in the business that are Silicon Valley oriented leaders like I think I prove myself out as a CEO having raised what I did the business that I did that even though I'm not in the Silicon Valley I'm Silicon Valley and Silicon Valley oriented by business is funded by Anderson Horowitz and lots of other Silicon Valley type investors then had a product is from like Zynga and a bunch of other businesses my head of technology is from Amazon and a bunch of other businesses of that uh that type so now what you have is you have a core of culture and with this core of culture because the Silicon Valley by the way Silicon Valley culture of whatever you want to call it it's not always super healthy as we uh talk in the middle of Burning Man right here as it's happening in uh Nevada uh Suka Valley uh orientation is not always super healthy either individually or culturally but I'll tell you that these [ __ ] know how to work and they know how to make progress and and there are people in like we have two people in Brazil there are people in Brazil that absolutely have just never had that dynamism before and have never experienced this type of business and them figuring it out alone is going to be way harder and them figuring it out when it's two three people that have run Silicon Valley venture back businesses before that's going to give the whole team a head start so that's how I think about it leaders from Silicon Valley ish adjacent team rest of the team can be anywhere and is the idea that the Silicon Valley esque leaders are teaching these non Silicon Valley ask people to bring them up to speed or are you saying it doesn't even matter like if you're a a designer or an engineer like as long as you do your job you know you don't need to be silky yeah let me think about it for a second so the first thing is it's like culture was absorbed right like if if you have I mean you were inside of it may be the in your cases it was a little unusual like you were inside wework I don't know how you would talk about that culture but I bet there's a bunch of things we could do over reverse underneath uh you were inside it's sort of adjacent to stumble upon which is an early Silicon Valley success and you were I mean you you lived in San Francisco for a while so you know what it's like to run a business in Silicon Valley now a lot of people in Canada and I have some coaching clients in Canada to give you a sense right like they think they know what it's like to run a Silicon Valley business truly they do not they don't know what it's like to work at to have worked at PayPal in 1999. as as the economy was crashing and they were like they we have so much fraud and we don't even know what to do they don't know what product Market fit feels like I actually actively ask people this I'm like do you know what it feels like to have product Market fit have you ever been in a business that didn't have it and then suddenly got it has that yeah if you've never had that experience before you don't know how to chase up you don't know when you have it so and then you can ask people the question do you have product markets in their business and they'll be like I think so and you'll be like you do not have it because it is such a uh a a crazy clear feeling when you have it that you're like oh [ __ ] this is it all right so I think a lot of people are in denial and they believe they run by the way you run a technology business whatever [ __ ] way you want I think I was thinking about a hugging face which I think is a French company that just got a gigantic round of investment from [ __ ] sorry it's like I'm live on the show and I'm kind of trying to remember like 200 million dollars from Bane or something like this because of their focus on AI and this is this is not a Silicon Valley company but they made it work so there's lots of different ways to make it work it's just that there's there's there's a model that we should kind of be following and lots of people are looking kind of like Plato you know what I mean they you know how Plato talks about the the allegory of the cave and he's like the the a man is looking at the Shadows on the wall and he thinks that the Shadows on the wall are reality and he's like oh yeah these Shadows on the wall look here this person's doing this this person is doing this but he doesn't actually see the people he just sees the Shadows of the people on the wall this is the allegory of the cave and so in Silicon Valley the way that this works is people all over the world read blog posts and Twitter I think we still call them tweets and they take those and they say oh this is this is how a startup should be run but they don't steal it in their heart and because they don't feel that there's a piece that they're missing most people feel like they understand what working at a startup is and what it's like to work in a tech company but when if they haven't been in one in Silicon Valley they really don't know what it feels like and they don't really know how to work that hard and I don't know what a product working fit feels like so they're kind of aping it without ever really having been in it before yeah I wonder where my head's at is if that culture and that way of thinking is a multiplier on productivity and high quality work I'm just wondering Beyond having great leaders and managers how else could you accelerate your team so for example you know when someone gets onboarded to your to your team do you like set them up with five podcasts that they should listen to you know do you say like here's here's a Twitter account with you know that's following 200 people that I think you would really benefit from yeah yeah it's interesting that you say that it's true that sometimes when you hire people and they're inside of the the sort of content bubble of tech that they start with a set of standards and that uh if if you if they don't like if they don't come from that world that you kind of have to you educate as you build and if you're educating as you build here's the sort of weighted that manifests itself you have to be like hey here's why we're going after this type of Customer because this type of customer will do extra this type of business and we could bring that to 100 million people or to 100 million dollars in Revenue here's why uh we need to have a higher priced account because a higher priced account means that these customers will are more professional have more money to spend and will be able to uh we'll be able to be with us for longer right and turnout less so there's all these different sort of like if you if you run a business at scale and you know somebody might say that this is just good business that's true but most people that have not gotten a business to product Market fit maybe that had Revenue the tattoo have been sass it could be anything like those they they have a slice of understanding of what what business is and I know that that's certainly true for me like when I started breather which as you keep saying I raised uh over 100 million dollars of venture capital while I was CEO like did I understand that I was really starting a low margin a lower margin business not really like I didn't quite get it I was just like there's a product and we're gonna build it and I know a lot of people are gonna like it I was right about a lot of things but at the core of it there were a set of misunderstandings about business that I did not have and when you haven't what you have in in Tech circles New York whatever it doesn't really matter where is you have this fundamental understanding of business that people in quote unquote the rest of the world don't have like there's a reason you drive down from San Francisco into to Mountain View or whatever like that you're seeing gigantic like Billboards for SAS companies that you've never heard of on Twitter and they're gigantic these are expensive they're maybe the most expensive full Parts you could possibly buy in America so maybe the world I don't know you know and and but like these people know things that we don't know like they think a lot more about net retention right nrr than we do and so like it's it's really something to uh uh to think about the fundamentals of business and just again they're so ingrained in me now I'm almost like a low-key like Finance bro and and I was not that way then and so lots of people who begin working at tech companies don't have those fundamental understandings and so they don't necessarily understand why a business would uh let's say try their hand at sales uh which we did a a short while ago and adding a team's product and they're like well wait hold on a second like don't we just serve people on the internet that just come in and we're like yeah we do that but then turns out that people come in with teams of 10 20 30 people and so we're going to serve those people as well and and so the change in economics that occurs there is not necessarily clearly understood by the rank and file designer off the street when you have 10 designers that you hire or something right and certainly not the average one in a texian in Canada so you know innovation in Silicon Valley it's ironic for me to say this because I will not move to San Francisco I I will not I don't this is I love California but I won't speak highly of it in a lot of cases what they do have is they have generations of innovators uh Walter Isaacson has a book about this called the innovators it turns out and so like it goes all the way back to Intel it goes all the way back from Intel to Fairchild semiconductor it goes back even further than that so we're talking about at this point the 60s so we're talking about generations of Technology innovators that have built layers of Technology on top of one another and so they're going to see the future much more clearly and that's why they get to create it there's the reason that openai has a billion dollars in Enterprise Revenue today out of nowhere quote unquote out of nowhere like these people are going to build the future and you necessarily have to want to be in the center of that but holy hell you better understand the center of that and understand how those people do things and why they make those decisions I definitely could not have done that at my last Venture back business was funded by Canadian and started by Canadians which honestly no very little business backing in my case very little business understanding in my case yeah being in tech for long enough like really changes you some people might say this is bad I think it's net good all things considered so Sam Altman although when we think of Silicon Valley we think of someone like Sam Altman now he's a New Yorker you know he's a New Yorker who Moved 992 Silicon Valley but he did surround himself with the Silicon Valley you know people right so I think uh you don't need to be from Silicon Valley to to to to get that as long as you absorb it and my thesis is you know with so many podcasts and YouTube channels and and so many people now tweeting you know you're the average of the five friends you spend the most time with but you're also the average of the five podcasts you consume I think that a really underrated way and a cheaper way frankly than moving to San Francisco or the Flatiron District in New York City uh is you just make it a point to load up with content and from these people in and I'm not talking about like listening to the all-in podcast which is like obviously a great podcast but it's yeah you know a big podcast uh thanks for Clara I'm talking about yeah I'm saying like what what is the niche podcast that you should be listening to that can really up level you that has a lot of these a lot of this DNA so for example you know Lenny richardsky's podcast who he spent you know 10 years in Silicon Valley and he's interviewing all these people and he talks to product managers and it's very specific to product managers Yeah it's you're right that you need to be absorbing all the time you know it's funny uh when I was a writer writing books for a living and doing talks and the social media space like way before I was ever a tech CEO uh convinced at the time by the way that I couldn't become a tech CEO and Greg Yuri instrumental in convincing me that I could become one so thanks for that I owe you one uh at the time I read [ __ ] [ __ ] tons and my my bookcase to the left of me here is actually filled with in a lot of cases garbage books but it kind of didn't matter I kept absorbing them and absorbing and absorbing and absorbing I was non-stop learning I will say it's been a great challenge of mine and audio really does help it helps a lot but it's a great challenge of mine too while working and being a operator of a business to also be absorbing as much as possible audio you're right is the right way to do it for me because you just can't absorb as quickly and you can't absorb passively like I think I'm reading listening to three audiobooks at the moment that are either classic or that are important kind of uh Tech books about certain things in some case sales in some case operations and other things like that like books that are known to people uh Phoenix project eat their lunch high output management these types of books that you could just sort of passively absorb that those are in some cases books about how heck happens and and you're right it you can you ideally you absorb it on the cheap the part that you cannot absorb on the cheap and both you and I know this actually and and we do it so it's important to actually to say it is that it it cannot create networks for you and so if you're at zero Network I got this question last week from out from someone I'd be like how did you meet the people at Andreessen Horowitz well holy [ __ ] I met Andrew Chan my partner today at Anders norowitz in 2000 14. 13 we did a deal in 2021 eight years later on a separate business like networks are built and you become a trusted person inside of those networks over time right not immediately so there's is a funny thing now where like like we can we can go remote and my company can become good enough have a great series a and I could I could walk into whatever [ __ ] Sequoia capital or whatever right I certainly get a meeting at Circle of capital and I can certainly take that meeting and they absolutely will consider it but it wouldn't have been the case in the same way 10 years ago so what happened then track record and you don't get a track record remotely and you and by the way a track record could involve failures but it has to involve smart failures and also Network being in the same places as all these people it's it being on podcasts right is is one way actually because people consume it and and also to be at parties with people and to go to these stupid Retreats like not lots of them are douchey but on occasion you are able to meet people this way and so like the the networking part and we I hesitate to call it that it's really just build it building a set of people that have an alignment with you and that you know them and they're smart and one way or another either you're going to work with them or you'll invest in their company or they'll invest in yours or or you'll spend time together somewhere who knows right like like all of those they they put you very tightly into an ecosystem system and if you're in one you will go the same direction as the ecosystem goes I'm a big fan of kind of staying quote unquote in the arena let's use a different analogy today so we'll use we'll use of getting as many at bats as possible and if you have a lot abouts look your batting average might be shitty but it actually doesn't matter you just need to be successful once and if you're successful once and it's enough of a big hit you're actually good you're good forever and so the way you get those at bats is by being in the ecosystem an ironic thing about being a CEO coach that I didn't expect is that I get access to companies as they are succeeding and in some cases I get a chance to invest in them and because of that I'm like oh wow here's this company that I would never have seen otherwise you know that I get a chance to be a part of and I get a chance to be able to be involved with and help and help have the the Sounders succeed and I wouldn't I just like you need to be in these conversations all that iron it's not easy to do that and you can't buy your way in so one school of thought is in order to get into these rooms you have to get on a plane and meet these people another school of thought is you create high quality content and you attract people you are an interesting person in this case because you're like OG blogger OG podcast person uh and and and and when I say that I mean like I'm on your blog right now like you you when Facebook likes were a thing and people were embedding Facebook likes on blog posts you were getting tens of thousands of likes onto your blog post pretty regularly like you were breaking on the internet back then and I did I did a few times that's true yeah and you know when I look at your post you know you had some posts you know I'm looking like 2013 2013 and then then you went to one Post in 2014 and then you had a two posts in 2020 then you had one Post in 2021 and you had two posts in 2023. so interestingly enough you did the content thing before content was cool you had a mega popular blog on the backs of that you created you know New York Times best-selling books and then you sort of retreated from content yeah and actually I lasted longer than most people I think there's a thousand blog posts on my blog over a period of what's got to be 10 years or more and it was my job for a long time and so there's two paths I think there's two paths to making content and having it continuously grow so one of them is be an operator and be able to hire someone so that's that definitely one way like for example when I the way I used to do it at breather I don't do it here today but the way I used to do it at breather is I would have a person on my marketing team and I would reach out to them I'd be like hey we're going to build a tweet storm and I would be like and I'm gonna say it to you and then you can write it down and you can make it into a tweet storm let me know when you've got it put it into a Google draw a Google Drive Doc and then I'll publish it once I've kind of consented and agreed that my ideas have been well presented by you right so now all that I did is the same thing that I did here which is to talk about my opinions and my experience uh it involved didn't involve sitting down in front of content in the same way what I discovered was me being the engine meant that I was the and by actually I will say I was the engine and the gas this is actually a this is an expression from Emily uh Emily my God I forget her last name it'll come to me uh from a marketing standpoint you need both engine and gas to build something in marketing and if you are the engine the engine is the mechanics of the marketing and how it happens if you are the gas you're the fuel you are the thing something is being pumped into it and through it and it could be content for example but when you're the engine and you're the fuel at the same time it's super easy for you to burn out I know like lots of people clearly it's it's I think it's the real you on this podcast that's like not fakeable but certainly someone could uh ghost write a book and they would never have really written a whole a word of it and and so the engine is their brand and and their maybe the their distribution mechanism but the the gaps the fuel is not really them in the first place in the same way you know the same way I was going to say well make an old and algae like John McCain let's make a new analogy uh whatever some politician might write a book right they didn't really write the book they sat in a room with someone else and they dictated the book to them and so if you are going to make content the thing that is going to get you in the room which by the way is so effective like let's just use it we'll we'll I'll ask you it as an example how many DMS do you get called let's let's say just ones that are are to some degree valuable per week per week I would say I get 40 DMS per day of which one is valuable per day right so that's a good ratio I get seven very valuable DMS per week there we are and so it it's taken you a long time to build up this content engine and it continues to build itself and and so clearly it's this stage and I can think of a few people like sahil like yourself a bunch of other people that you and I know when that I share as investors in some cases Lenny is one of them and and they their engine of content is so big that it's just gonna contain it's gonna keep happening they're gonna be able to hire people around it which probably Lenny as I haven't asked them but probably surely like like there's an editor making something and maybe some of his uh guests are are found ahead of time by someone else right so there's an engine that's been built around it in the early days you have to be able to get past that and I will say that in the early days of content going back to your point uh all of us that were trying to do this Chris Brogan my co-author on trust Asians when I published it in 2009 a bunch of us did not have proper engines around our contact this is actually a huge lesson some of us did Gary vaynerchuk is also from that era but Garrity had a machine around him and he had a clear business model at the time it was actually selling wine at the very beginning then it was he was the social media person and he built a social media agency so now he's got the machine the engine around him and he has a clear business that he's trying to drive now you can do that but like you know the way that I think about the the people that are making mistakes in this space it's my perspective by the way is like you you may you may remember lots of people remember a nerd writer from YouTube it used to be a huge amazing uh account with tons of visitors and viewership go lot two philosophical started writing books could not keep going at it and didn't make it commercial enough this is by the way I don't know them I'll just give you my perspective versus a Mr Beast that is very clearly like I'm I'm I just don't care like I will find whatever is the most compelling thing I have no aesthetic sensibilities you know I'm literally just gonna make a little thing that people love click I gotta that isn't works and it works essentially to Infinity so and and by the way Gary did a version of that and Gary is from that time and so on so the big book that changed my perspective on this was a book called The Big switch that I read a really really long time ago and it really made clear that either someone was in the engine or someone owned the engine so everyone is building little businesses inside of uh Twitter or Instagram or Tick Tock or something and they're building these little micro businesses and for a long time my focus was building a little micro business that was that had followers and but but the engine was the same and you could sponsor posts or you could uh you could you could build uh you know what we didn't call it them but like an influencer based business now my focus is build a machine that is a real business that can get to [ __ ] [ __ ] tons of Revenue with a really big set of users and the result is is you become influential as a result of your success that's really what I noticed the Breather I didn't talk about breeder very much but holy [ __ ] everybody knew that business and everybody use that what in one way or another and um and everybody knew that brand they knew that Brandon they maybe didn't even know me and so that was so powerful to realize that I didn't have to work on content to get influence and to get in the room all that I had to do was make something really interesting and that was enough yeah but I think the question I would have to push back is if you had continued with the content would that have added a multiplier on that trust and influence for sure but I would have nea I needed for me I needed to learn a lesson that I didn't need to be on my own sitting in front of a computer screen writing a thousand word blog post that I was trying to get to go viral or something every day I need to to become an operator of a business that did things and this was one of those things and I think there's a lot of people and by the way the audience is different now right because now you can get a hundred million followers or whatever you want Tick Tock you couldn't do that down the internet was just not that mature but those people that did succeed they were able to separate themselves from the content they were able to say I run a business and my marketing engine is content versus I am the content I am the engine and I am the business which is just too much and uh and and I think it you know in a lot of ways was too early so where are you with respect to content for Julian Smith like it feels like you're slowly getting back into it now you have a podcast that you've been doing saw a couple 2023 blog posts you change your profile picture from some like strange lizard looking person to something a bit more serious where are we at yeah and there's more coming that I I'm not at a place where I'm ready to talk about yeah but you're right you you're noticing that I am taking him more seriously because I am taking him more seriously I felt that I still feel for the first time like everything is aligned properly one of the big struggles that I experienced at the time was the voice that I had built on my blog and how how difficult it was to align with being a CEO of a 250 person business that was accidentally ended up selling um fractional office space right like it was just so incongruent with what my brand was and that's because they were really built by accident I'll tell you what they what that gave me is it gave me a confidence that I wasn't a fluke success and that I wasn't a [ __ ] idiot because I was like okay well clearly I had a voice on from a Blog standpoint at a book standpoint that resonated with people oh and I also was able to build the best out of and raise a lot of money I was like okay I'm not a like and so my imposter syndrome didn't exactly vanish but I definitely like diminished I was like oh okay I'm I'm qualified for like the first time probably and so um but but nonetheless that incongruence that that contradiction between blogger writer Julian and CEO Julian really did exist and I didn't deliberately align it but I did kind of accidentally align it when I um made a decision about what next business I want to run and I said okay well what are the few things that I really cared about and I've always cared about and I knew that when you run up especially a business that you're trying to get somewhere big it's going to take you 10 years I think about our friend Rob uh who's been running a business for his business I want to say 12 years or something and if now really successful but but at the very beginning like everybody else you know it's like like a zigzag you just don't know where it's gonna go you get to the other side you're like wow that was impressive it takes a long time to build something that lasts some that's really powerful I thought what are the things that I can build that I really have always cared about and that I will always care about and a few things came to my mind one of them was self-development and I always cared about self-development another one was I always cared about the little guy and that's always been a theme throughout everything that I've done and then another one as I which is not really related but I thought about is I I always really care about games I'm a huge board game person I'm a huge Dungeons and Dragons and RPG person less so computer games or console games but still games were always at the center of uh how I spend my time so I was like well what do I care about today that I'm going to care about in five years there's only a few things that have been in that Realm so I said well I gotta build something around those things and that's why we started at practice building around coaches and solopreneurs now we're waiting now we're like coaches tutored a lot of tutor customers teams of these people virtual assistants like all these other solopreneurs individual businesses and team businesses so all of those things align themselves and then then I had a coaching practice which I've had for I want to say three years four years and it's been I think I think now might be the third year anniversary so and I still have some clients from back then and so everything has kind of aligned itself in a way that it wasn't before now I run a business working for the little guy I have a coaching practice which is self-development oriented I have tons of writing that I've done that is self-development oriented if you remember from the blog back in the day and all of my books were about that stuff and so all it it feels like the first time I'm 44 today uh I feel like for the first time everything is kind of aligned and I haven't felt that a long time maybe especially because there's so many things going on now right like my life is more complicated than it was and uh but everything is aligned towards the things that I care about it's I started a coaching practice to dog food my own software in 2020 2021 the result is is I have a small coaching practice it's really thriving it's successful and I really love that part of my life and if I write I know I'm writing or if I'm speaking on a podcast I know I'm going to be speaking to a bunch of people that uh that are really going to be able to uh resonate with with the stuff that I've written because I have a real voice so it's all just kind of connected at this point and and that took me a really long time to align those different versions of myself into one what you're saying is in order to come up with a long-term content strategy you have to look Inward and really be honest with yourself to basically find what are the buckets that I really care about that I want to be creating content in 5 10 15 20 years so in order to look yeah in order to in order to go outward you have to look inward do you have any advice for people who Wanna you know who don't want to wait until their 40s maybe or or 50s or 60s and you want to get going right away I'm super convinced that the things I cared about in my 20s I also cared about Nehemiah was 12. I believe that they I probably you're gonna find new things right you you're like you're really into sports in your teens you might be really into baseball like I was in your 30s you might be really into basketball nonetheless you're into sports and you've always been into sports okay sure so you actually don't need to here here's what here's what your past needs to contain and these are really broad checklist items one of them is hopefully it's something that you cared about and have cared about for a really long time and and so if so you're probably never going to stop caring about it in the same way your view will change you might get more cynical about the basic parts of it you might you're you're sophisticated you're I wrote a book to Flinch in 2013 that really took off almost everything from there I'm still very proud of that book but there's some things in that book where I was like yeah I don't know about that but I still am really happy with that book The Influence I had with those people and yeah I'm not writing a sequel to that book but like I still care about those things I'm never going to stop caring about those things so there are through lines in your life that you have had forever and it is really easy if you align your life with those things somehow that's really challenging sometimes because sometimes those things don't have a commercial orientation right so you're actually you'll be like oh I I legitimately did think about how could I build a games company in some way I thought about this for a while in 2018 2019. uh I found that it would be difficult but I definitely considered it because I knew the time would just pass and that the people that I would work with would just be so easy to work with and they would be my type of people I just knew that and and so it's almost like acknowledging instead of saying I'm on land it's like I'm in a river and the river is me and the river is all of the past stuff that has ever happened to me and all of the previous decisions and so the river has a slow and you have to acknowledge what that slow is you a version of you that can be self-reflective can look at the river of you and be like who am I and what do I care about and how do I attach that to things that are going on in 2023 and if you do that you probably have years of content by the way some of them are so Niche I was watching such a stupid thing to watch I'm embarrassed to say this I don't consume a ton of short form I consume tons of long-form videos so I'm I'm on YouTube a lot and I was consuming I think a two hour long history of Street Fighter 2 okay and the the guy who has this channel this literally all that he makes is history of video game worlds and people love it and it's really clear that this guy also really loves it is that big no does it need to be it gives a [ __ ] he loves it his millions of people that watch his videos love it and it'll expand as it as it goes on way better than trying to follow some Trend that you only have a vague understanding of you know and the truth is I think he could he could build a a pretty big business around it like he could well first he can do a paid Community he can do info products he can create his own games he could yep there's a lot of ways you know if he was interested I don't know if this is just like a side hobby or just a hobby for him but if he you know he now has the opportunity to make that decision and how cool is that that you know he can go and do that and and clear out his his job you know who knows working at in a restaurant or a bar or working at KPMG or you know pushing papers I don't know sure yeah and there's actually it's a great opportunity in 2023 because it's like for the first time like the whole world is online we're coming online that's incredible and there's so many ways to speak to so many people I can't see how you would I I get it you know I'm giving people feedback here right now live I'm saying go after things you care about some people will find that like they're going to find parts and they're going to realize that visual media sculpture like my fiance like those people they're not going to be like I should be in Tech so here they're not going to be in a quote-unquote growth space but I'd probably the people who are lit who are listening to this or watching this are thinking one okay I want to be doing something on the Internet very like I have my own project or I want to attach myself off to a project and then two they'll be thinking okay well and I've got these these Ley lines so to speak these lines underground in my world and I need to figure out what those things are so for them they can find insane growth areas and that's really what Venture is about going back to the beginning of the conversation Venture is about finding a CEO that has quote unquote uh you know Market founder market fit who really cares about the space alongside a super fast growing town where ideally they have a secret about that town right and so if that happens amazing Confluence of things but even if your choice is not uh is I want to start a restaurant and that's what your lifeblood is about you probably know that and you probably don't care if it's a growth space or not I don't know what your odds are and that's why you and I are in this space like we build businesses really naturally online it's just kind of the kind of person that we are but we we had it took us time to kind of like figure that out and now that we're here it kind of comes together it doesn't need to happen in your 40s it just happens when you when you realize who you are yeah which sometimes that happens in your 40s sometimes happens your 20s 30s 50s 60s or sometimes that never happens at all right exactly you're referring to anyone in particular no I've got no one in mind but you know I think a lot of people uh you know I think one lesson here is just it's okay to not know and but I think you you need to make that conscious effort to to be self-discovering which sounds obvious but you know one of the great ways that one of the cool things about building audiences I think is that it allows you to not have to invest tons of money and time into into learning about a space so for example if you're passionate about uh food and opening up a restaurant one day well there's like a path that you can take right so you could you know maybe create a create a food truck which is like kind of like the MVP of you know building a restaurant but what's even more MVP than that is maybe like going to creating a YouTube channel that interviews people uh in the kitchen at different restaurants and having and just like interviewing them and learning them learning with them and seeing if other people might be interested in that and then all of a sudden you're building this audience with you and then you build this community and then you could potentially you know hey you trust me because I know all the cool restaurants or interesting restaurants and chefs in my city now I have my own restaurant or my own food truck come and visit so I think the coolest part about audience and content is the doors it opens and how cheap it is to to actually do so that's why that's where I was coming from when I was like dude why aren't you creating more content and I understand how much work it takes but I also think that you know there you don't need to be a full-time Creator you can be a part-time Creator and you can spend one hour a week or two hours a week and still create a niche audience if if anyone wanted you are you're right I will say as a thought though that I really believe in the Gary vaynerchuk kind of method which is it's it's got to happen like an hour a day that's my perspective just having like having written a thousand blog posts having written over three books probably definitely and and discarded many words along the way you don't figure it out without sitting in front of a page or whatever your version of that is like some editing software suite like whatever it is you actually don't figure it out unless your your hands are just in it all the time and and so you can't get really really good at something I don't know if it's ten thousand hours it could be anything but whatever it is like you don't get really really good at it by by uh by being a hobbyist unless you're a hobbyist for 30 years right if you want to get really good at something like being a CEO is a crazy example you know being a CEO is a wild job and being a Founder is a crazy job like I would never encourage anyone to do this unless I knew that they had to do it because it's psycho as a uh a way to run your life but I don't have a choice it's it's built into me it's probably built into you so I cannot learn that part-time I cannot understand the influence of trade-offs in a business part-time I cannot understand the consequence of road map decisions part-time I cannot build products and put them in the market in a fake way right and when you're unless you're starting them putting things on a in a Tim Ferriss way like just a landing page like you do mini versions of that but to really learn you've got to do it like a hundred times so I'm a I'm a big believer in doing a couple things and doing them well because you really get compound effects like hugely compounding effects committing to them God where did I see this I think it was Gary again I don't even really listen to him but like like I saw him on like some Tick Tock thing maybe and somebody was talking about how they feel old and it's like a [ __ ] like conference table and Gary's Auto and like he's like you haven't even lived he's talking to a dude that's 23 you know like you get there's there's this comic I'll reference back to it we can talk about it in the show notes Maybe where uh they talk about every seven years you get to live a new life and I've found that to be true so from 18 to about 24 I built a career doing just not much of a career building random off doing random office stuff I didn't really have a career nor did I go to college uh and graduate from 24 to 31 I was a Content person and as a Content person I built out a a successful content business right that included New York Times best-selling books viral other books and PDFs uh viral blog posts by gigantic standards that everybody talked about and then at 31 and you were there ish 33 really I started a venture back business and my that course began again and so that course was started in 2013 2012 and continues today and then three four years ago so again the seven year Arc I started a coaching practice and now I'm an executive coach which is not something that probably I could have done my father was a coach like I could not have done that probably while he was alive it would have been too weird but now I can do it and so it's like a whole other Arc so there's so many different arcs that are people go on in their lives so and they had so many different shots on goal of things that they really can do so so you shouldn't do things for like a year or two year part-time you really should go at them super super hard and put your soul in you should you should work so hard that you die a little bit working on this there and then only then can you say man when you and then that you know that's that's when something does really well I find when you really put your heart on Soul into something Seth Godin taught me this when he was editing Flinch the book he said to me uh you're gonna have you said a few things I remember one is is you're only gonna have one shot ever to write a book this visceral that's what he said I said okay and I took that really seriously because Seth Gordon was like like I like my idol a little bit and my mentor and another thing that he said was do you want to write a book that's good or do you want to be in awe of what you have written and I was like holy [ __ ] I got off the phone Helen never she'll never forget telling the story she always tells that I was I was screaming you know not at her but like out there in the world after hanging up the phone or whatever being like I don't know how to do that yeah but but I I did work that hard at that thing and that's why that book had that reached it down so anyway I'm not sure what this talk is about or what you're going to title it those are the things I think all I know is I'm like ready to run through a brick wall right now that's all I know laughs I feel very inspired I feel I agree with you on the every person lives so many lifetimes and every seven years that there is a new life and I almost think that and actually I don't almost think I think that not only should you reflect on that and be like wow I'm entering a new chapter but also get yourself a physical item that you can wear or maybe for you it's like a tattoo or whatever just something that you can see uh maybe it's like a gold watch who knows a ring a bracelet something that commemorates that you've entered into this new place so that every time you see it you you're reminded of it that's a good lesson it's true I I have some awards from my book writing days that I still look on fondly today it doesn't mean that they're in the center of my [ __ ] house but like when I look at them I'm like oh yeah that's true you know it reminds you and you do need to be reminded because you're the Arc of your life is a long one hopefully before we head out about what's one book recommendation that that you can give to people that they sh that is a is a must read based on this conversation based on this conversation I'm just going to give a few things that I find a really interesting about relative to our conversation uh we have we have a mutual friend Dario Mellie who's one of the founders of boot Suite he got me into these books by uh David Graham one of them is being made into a Martin Scorsese movie I think killers of the flower and but he has another book about Obsession his books are always kind of about Obsession and the book that really influenced me that I just finished is lost city of Z which is about the exploration of the Amazon and trying to find El Dorado in the early 1920s and it is an exploration of obsession and how what Obsession really looks like and also the consequences so that's a really powerful word like others I consume tons of important startup texts like high output management and I listed a higher Management on my uh on my phone through audible kind of non-stop I think my broader lesson is uh audiobook subscriptions like audible are actually a great idea because they accumulate a set of credits over time and then you're like I've got nine credits [ __ ] or whatever because you haven't consumed them and then you're like let me go look for things and now you've got nine books to teach you about startup so you've got nine books to teach you about psychology and all those things will give you an ability to absorb and change and help you become who you want to be that is something that is really meaningfully improved my life I'll take it where could uh where can people follow Julian and and your content and practice and learn more about practice Yeah practice is at practice.do and uh you should absolutely check it out I am mostly on Twitter

incubating versus buying is a really interesting formula for me I think about it in terms of where I can find significant Advantage right now assets are super expensive and it's very expensive to buy businesses you know I think when assets are expensive you go create assets and so really the past four years has been a lot more incubation for me and a lot less uh m&a Michael girdley holdco Legend you know I feel like there's this new generation of hold Co entrepreneurs and you've been doing it for a while yeah started going on second business I got into and really stepped out of my first one was about a decade ago so been a while so for folks who don't know you could you could you just explain you know what your portfolio is looking like what you're up to oh sure for sure for sure well today uh what I do is well I tweet a lot evidently but um I own about a dozen different businesses uh here I'm located here in Texas in San Antonio I grew up here moved away for a while but came back uh my wife and I got back here 20 years ago now um before we got married and we've been here ever since and so I have a diversified uh portfolio of companies I try not to call it a portfolio because that makes me sound like a douchy BC but um you know I would consider those like deep and significant investments in companies I've either created or purchased and uh that are meaningful for me I sit on the board of them and am deeply involved um so there's everything from a fireworks business that was the very first business I was I got into and we still own that there is an education company we started out that was the first company I did outside of the fireworks business and in the past five years have really been an explosion of new businesses I've you know I think I've honed down my ability to incubate companies uh my model of how to do it uh and my understanding how business Works those have all kind of come together and you over the past year has past five years has really been the growth from two or three businesses up to up to the Dozen where we're at today and how do you think about incubating versus buying uh incubating versus buying is a really interesting formula for me I think about it in terms of where I can find you know significant Advantage um right now assets are super expensive and it's very expensive to buy businesses so I you know I think when assets are expensive you go create assets and so really the past four years has been a lot more incubation for me and a lot less uh m&a which I feel like goes against what a lot of hold co- entrepreneurs are saying on Twitter you know I feel like right now especially in like Tech hold Co entrepreneur land they're saying you know oh it's so hard to go from zero to one go and buy a business are you seeing that too uh people are saying they should go buy a business yes because it makes it looks like it makes it look like you can skip that that really annoying part of building a business which is like when you feel like things aren't going anywhere for the first like 18 months or so um you know at the same time like if everybody's trying to go buy a new business right they're gonna prices are going to get pushed up there's gonna be a lot of comp competition going after the same assets and it's gonna be harder for you so yeah you know I think it's just one of those things for me it's always like watching where the opportunity is then rushing to it and if everybody's saying one thing that's usually a sign you should be doing something different totally I feel like two to three times a day I get the pitch saying do you know how many baby boomers are going to retire over the next few years and they you know how many businesses they run these businesses are going to close down you can buy them for pennies on the dollar well so I mean I think what people don't do is kind of like the you know the law of large numbers aspect to it where it's like okay well why don't you go through and think about all these baby boomer businesses and let's go with the first thing which is businesses you just don't want to be in right like there's just like okay so that cuts out like all the gentleman's clubs and like all the scummy stuff so that knocks out a bunch of business that you know you're not gonna be proud to tell people you want to be in at a cocktail party and then there's like okay well let's now let's knock out all the businesses that only really exist because something that goes home every night with the owner that could be the owner's relationships like the owner's like knowledge that could be the owner's like credentials and suddenly you look up and there's not that many businesses actually out there compared to the number of buyers who are out getting them and then there's another problem on top of all that which is a lot of these baby boomers have figured out something to do with their business already they're going to sell it to a strategic or they're going to give it to their kids or they're hiring a a manager so like yeah I know people are finding businesses from Baby Boomers but like I think that's kind of way overblown in terms of how many are truly out there it's not a tsunami it's something more like a little Ripple just how I would think about it and when you do buy a business how do you like yeah how do you find business you know great businesses to buy yeah uh there's the there's two will ways that buying businesses tends to happen for people including me one is like the front door approach like you just start um you just start doing what everybody else does going through listings learning about an industry making phone calls you know learning about them that's what we do on our podcast Acquisitions Anonymous which of the five podcast I've started that's the one that has survived because it does well and uh like that's what we do we go through listings and we look at a business each week and then we talk about it and figure out if we would want to pursue it more so you know like most of the m&a I've participated in is um is software m&a because well software is like I know that a lot and I have a competitive Advantage there it's much better for me to go buy something that I have a competitive advantage in than to try to compete you know when I don't and um so in the case of that you know there's the front doorway which is just like looking at listings going through the the Brokers and all that kind of stuff and seeing you know what the investment bankers and that sort of thing are are pitch ing that works and you can sometimes find deals there um what I find is much more interesting is like the serendipitous approaches where it's like you know through your network like the Great Deals always seem to have some weird way that they come into your into your world like it's a friend of a friend or your college buddy knows something going on it's some data that's not out there that everybody else can see and that kind of inside information is where the most kind of interesting m&a opportunities happen and and most the m&a I've done over the past four years has been through the Duro software that we set up it's a a really quickly growing company um they're up over 200 people or so Global uh and we've bought going on 15 companies now um through that platform and it's a hold Co that is actually underneath my holdco so there's other shareholders there as well but I founded the business and got it started that way so uh I've participated in you know the underwriting of all those Acquisitions those guys have done so you raised money for that that sub hold Co yeah we started we started it with our own money me and the the CEO uh and then we did a couple of Acquisitions and then we ran out of money so then we brought on Equity partners and a bank Deb and then it has grown since then and then we brought on a professional uh Investment Group uh a private Equity Firm called Peterson uh they agreed to invest in the company and took board seats and came in and put $50 million in the company uh about four months ago so you know when it was clear the opportunity was really big and required a lot of capital and we were going to run out of my Capital uh we brought in a partner there and so I'm on the board with those folks and and so that's how that got structured but we started it with our own money and took it from there you know for as much as you can share like are you happy you did that and the reason I ask is I haven't publicly said this but we like last week we had an offer for about $30 million to invest in Lay check out our holding company and the you know one of of the one of the top institutional investors VC's someone I really respect he sits on two public company boards or two or three public company Boards of some of like my favorite products so I really respect him but the idea of like giving up control and just having and maybe VC is different than PE but just having to prime it for an exit at some point made me a little uncomfortable so we ended up declining that I'm curious he a do you are you happy with that situation and then B if you were me would you have taken that deal from that VC oh if I was you that's a great question um first of all am I happy totally delighted like when we started to talk with Peterson we asked around about their reputation and talk to references and all that kind of stuff and it it was fascinating even after we signed the deal that friends of mine like college buddies would be like oh I've worked with those guys they're really great and it turns out they are really great and what I enjoy about them and this is a cool anecdote like um they're from uh Utah so it's like a very family oriented stuff so it's not like it's not like uh what I describe as New York private Equity or Dallas private Equity where they like show up and they're like okay show me how you're gonna make me some money like these guys like uh they were awesome like the first meeting they're like okay well welcome to the business meeting first I'd like to know about you tell me about your family like and I was like what is going on here like these guys are amazing and that was really like a cultural alignment with the company we've created like our number one core value is to make Mom proud like literally we have that written there so it's like the nicest group of people ever so it's a good fit there and I think what is awesome is when you bring on growth Equity from a private Equity Firm like the good ones will go in and invest in adding value enough to where they earn their seat at the table and like you like it's totally worth it and so you know I think there's also besides that which Peterson is doing for me there's an understanding understanding of my limitations currently like I've never really built a business bigger than where Dura is currently like at a couple hundred people like your mindset and your like small business habits really have to change right like I've done a lot of like 30 50 100 person companies like I understand what that's like and you can still kind of think and act like a small business person but like as you start to get into the midsize company range like your mindset and your habits have to change again and so I knew when I looked around the table before Peterson came in that we really had an opportunity to we were G to have to grow again as a board and also as a leadership team to meet the kind of ambition that we had and the small business thinking and the habits that I had potentially like I needed to grow so frankly like in those board meetings now like I'm learning a lot just because they've been exposed to a lot of companies on the 200 to a thousand person kind of trajectory and like that's new to me and there's you know there's a bunch of examples of how that like plays out in practice like in a small business for example you don't have to look look really two or three quarters ahead to think about people problems right you could you're fixing your people problems right now but like at a midsize business like you have to get ahead of the game to be ready or it'll stunt your growth right for example you need to start planning ahead three or four quarters to say okay well we need to have this person in is VP of Corp Dev or this person as a controller otherwise the company like you can't look up and just change it on a dime because little small companies like speedboat and like a midsize company is like more like a tanker right it takes like a couple quarters to change things and so that's just like one example of like I knew Paul who's my co-founder like we just knew where we needed to learn and brought into people who've done it already and so anyway just totally delighted by by that decision I think it's a win-win win for like everybody involved and super happy I did it or we did it your second question was should you have done that deal like uh I don't know I'm not you I didn't mean to duck it but like I mean you were you it doesn't sound if you were you if if you were you like if you if you were you and you were in my actually if you were in my seat if you were in my seat let's play this out you're getting $30 million you know call it a SE aund million post um you know we're we're doing quite well um we don't we don't really need the capital but the capital would help fund more Acquisitions like larger Acquisitions and we might be willing to do but we're in software mostly right so the cost of creating our it when we incubate the cost of as you know the cost is of incubation isn't that high uh so anyways if you were Michael girley which you are but you were playing my role would you what would you do uh I would really ask myself in that situation like if I if you look at your day and you ask yourself during your day based on what you do from get up to do podcasts to go to bed at night and and how you describe that both to yourself and to other people people like that how does that day look after you take that money and is that going to be a happier day for you or a less happier day and I think it's the first sign for me like like you know I'd ask you right now like in terms of your dayto day like what percentage of your hours are tap dancing to work hours and what percentage are not as fun I mean I don't want to sound pompous or anything or like I'm gloating but 95% of my day is tap dance that's amazing that's that is a higher ratio than most people um you know it's interesting I talked to an entrepreneur last week who took a big slug of money like that for a VC back business he's running it and uh we did the same exercise and about 40% of his day was tap dancing to work and but at the same time once you take that VC money I think that's the second part of my question like what happens to your days then like how how tap dancing to work are you g to be after you take that money you know you know what I really love about my situation right now is the there's no I don't have a boss right you know like we my my take is that if you have investors you have Micro bosses and you have to manage expectations and you have to manage up and sometimes subconsciously you're doing things that are you're just trying to please them even if it's subconsciously because a lot of time you respect them you know for example this particular person maybe he says you know go acquire a Marketplace and even if I'm in that boardroom and I'm like no I think we should only be acquiring social networks for these reasons and then you know a month later I come across a Marketplace and I'm like oh I'm trying to like fit it in his model and then all of a sudden I'm like who I guess I'm working for him uh in some ways so the tap dance I feel like the fact that one one thing I really like about my situation is is we're self-funded you know me and my co-founder do whatever we want yeah it sounds like that's super super important to you and would and would really reduce your like day-to-day happiness so I don't know based on that like time time is like the one thing we can't get back right and it's like why why waste a minute of it on doing a life that really sounds like at its core is something that this VC wants you to live that life right and you have a different life that you want to live so to to me if I was you and I did the same analysis um you know I would I would totally you know make that decision now if I was Michael Gridley and I did things the way I do it which is like you know it's scalable for me because I tend not to run things and you know that sounds pretty exciting because I like interesting problems and it sounds like the 30 million on a 100 posts would be like some pretty cool problems to go solve and I think that would be fun but it wouldn't change my life as much as it sounds like it would change yours yeah I mean I had a phone call I I actually when whenever you have a for in the road like this I think that you should call smart people because actually you could just call call five people they don't you know they don't all need to be smart they just need to be people that you respect yeah I called or what happened you didn't pick up you didn't pick up you were you're too busy tap dancing to work or something yeah hey hey this uh you know I don't have much reception here in this chilies something like that you know one of the one of the people I called and going to n call him out but he was like I think you're making a really really big mistake and he was like concerned for me he was like I don't know why you're making this mistake you know you can be so much bigger and you're not unlocking your potential and with that $30 million like you could you know be public in two or three years and I was like have you spoken to public company CEOs lately like they don't love love it you know um obviously the liquidity is good um but he's like well it's not even just about that it's about the problems he says same thing he's like you'll be able to solve bigger problems and I'm like I don't know I I I I don't know about that like cuz you know I think if you're a solo preneur you're a multipreneur whatever a lot of the times you're solving interesting problems uh you're just standing on the shoulder of giants in terms of the technologies that you can you know be building upon the audiences that you can create and so I feel challenged in fact I feel more challenged today than I did running vent Venture back startups yeah and I think there's a fundamental I mean when I listen to what your friend talk I think there's a fundamental misconception a lot of people have especially here in America that bigger is always better right and it's like it's our nature like and it's so ingrained in the way we think about things like we don't even really like slow down and realize like it it's all around us right just like competition is such the core of American society like nobody even really talks about how weird that is like other other countries don't act that way and to me when I see somebody like your your adviser there like advising like hey you need to like it needs to be bigger and better or or it needs to be bigger otherwise it's not better like it's just a fundamentally flawed like worldview on the other side of that I think I really appreciate this adviser because when you call somebody like that you really want them to like give you a strongly worded but loosely held opinion and it sounds like he did which sounds exactly what you wanted because it helped you think about the issue better yeah I mean another person adviser I asked he was the senior vice president of Corp Dev of a $500 billion company and he just said I just texted him I was like what would you do I could read you the text just full transparency here on the Pod he had texted me about something else and I was like while I have you if you were me and you were offered $30 million for your hold Co to fuel Acquisitions for 20% of the business from a top Institutional Investor who sits on some board of some dope companies would you do it and then I said we currently generate X dollar of iida and then all of a sudden he's just like oh so it's you know this amount of like he was just calculating the multiples he's like well if the multiple is this then you should do it and multiple is that you know you should do it and I was thinking to myself no like where's the multiple of fun you know yeah the multiple where's the multiple of fun why is no one talking about the multiple of fun yeah well it's it's also this idea that nobody talks about is that there is a diminishing return on money like and I also have this like weird idea I've been toying with that it's actually there's there's negative marginal Returns on money as you get more of it like as I watch people who are like super rich like super duper rich like G6 or whatever whatever's the more expensive version of that like those people are actually all very like they spend a lot of time like a protecting the money and B like trying to figure out who around them is not a faker and to me like you know I think I think being somewhat Rich you know someday I'll get there right like that's the perfect thing rather than have to get more money and then you know you eventually get to a point where you're like Jeff Bezos where you're just like like he's just trapped in his Fame and each each additional dollar like actually makes his life worse in my opinion so I think there's an inflection point it's somewhere around being able to afford flying private but but you know it's like above that I think the marginal utility of dollars like eventually turns negative yeah there's a great framework for this I think it's you know are you building a prison or are you building a castle and I feel like not enough people take that framework when they're making big decisions like this they often times they get so seduced by the vision of what what you know $30 million $2 million whatever it is whatever that Milestone is they just all humans all of us we kind of just like picture what it what it looks like when that moment hits your company gets acquired like all these milestones and then it happens and you're like um am I in a prison right now yeah I think it's totally true well it reminds me it floated around on Twitter last night there's like a great Don Draper from Mad Men quote where he's like he's given his speech about why people shouldn't pursue happiness and the reason they shouldn't pursue happiness is because when they get it they want to go pursue more happiness it's just like the most bizarre like approach to life but also makes a ton of sense given how Don Draper like grew up like dirt poor and all this kind of stuff and had this really bizarre Life View but kind of reminds me of that which I was like a this is such a good quote not to you know this is a spoil a spoiler alert for Mad Men so block your ears for people listening but the last minute of Mad Men I don't know if you remember it but it's Dawn Draper in biger I think he's at the esselin retreat center in like the 60s and you just see him not wearing a suit wearing maybe like a t-shirt tucked in like he's in casual wear and he's looking off the you know into the water on these beautiful California Cliffs there's just this amazing Freedom like hippie 60s music that's playing and you could just tell that Don Draper finally is happy after all that after you know his clawing through life and climbing up the ladder and selling agencies and like Madison Avenue and you know and I think there's I think that was one of the big lessons for Madmen is just don't you know be like what what are you chasing and why such a good show good show so good so good so one of the reasons I wanted to talk to you is what you know it looks like you're having a lot of fun it looks like you're having a lot of fun and you do things I think Bas in like your curiosity so for example I you know you created a course uh when people think about creating courses a lot of time it's like negative and you know people are like why are you creating a course no you're just like I'm curious about this and you created a course why did you create the course what is it and are you having fun doing it yeah uh look creating a course is like writing a book it's not that much fun it's a lot of work and it's never as good as you want it to be that was the thing I definitely learned um I also learned a lot from doing the process like I did very much like a master class style course where it's just like look here's a lifetime of learning I'm going to cram it in like the original script was like 450 Pages like just this enormous dump of like everything I feel like I've learned over 25 years in business uh the reality is I think what I've learned since then is like people especially in a like an attention starved or a focus starved world like now like the idea of like a an 80h hour masterclass is probably not something like I would ever do again like I think people want stuff much more bite-sized and you're seeing like like me sharing messages now like I wouldn't imagine starting another podcast no offense to your podcast but like the aperture of consumption for potential podcast podcast is like is shrinking like not only is people consuming less of them but like the demand for people wanting 60 and 75 minutes stuff I think you know it's limited in terms of the options there for somebody like me so I'm doing like a lot more shorts like I recorded like 20 video shorts yesterday and I find those like super appealing because I just have to concisely put everything down and I think anything I would do in the future around a course um would be something much more manageable and short like a two to thre hour thing very specifically around that stuff um and so for me like the course is part of figuring out how to like there's this like idea that I want to grow my impact in terms of sharing messages and things I've learned and helping other people kind of figure out or get to the point where I feel like I'm like super happy I want other people to be here and like the course is like how do I make the Investments and feel good about it by monetizing the things I'm saying and then using that to reinvest in more content so like I've hired like a whole team to do like social media like I have a CEO of it now there's two of us or there's two of them plus me um and I'm trying to get it to a point where I just worry about teaching and messaging and then they just take care of everything else so the course was kind of the first bucket of that and I think we'll do more of that in the future just because well those guys that I hired they kind of want to get paid which is which is important and I I don't want to come out of pocket paying them so so yeah I'm curious about that I'm starting to see a lot more uh holdco entrepreneurs multi preneurs buildout media companies um so I know I just had Nick Nick cuber sweaty startup on the Pod and you know he has a team now that helps him with stuff how do you think about what are the goals for your media team like what what does success look like to them yeah well we've set a 10-year vision for our media stuff uh to get to a billion annual views um right now I'm at like 20 250 million if you count all the the Twitter stuff so um that may be low but like the goal for me and the reason to do it is really impact and I think impact is things I want to do in terms of helping people around the world like I've discovered like I'm not just like sharing messages and like teaching here I'm like creating connections with people at scale and I want to do that at a bigger scale and do do it in a very genuine way to help make the world a better place so that's you know that's kind of our Northstar is like Maximum Impact along the way I have some rules which is like number one I'm not doing social media because I want to get rich and actually is probably not a good way for me to do that there's better things I could do but I think it presents an opportunity for me to scale the other things I'm working on and make them all so much easier right like if I want to fund raise for a deal in the future or if I want to hire somebody like it's just easy just to tweet when you have an audience I think you know this your audience is bigger than mine so um so that's the goal of this is you know for me it's like a karmic refilling of how I'm doing it like by giving it to the universe it pays me back and then secondarily like the the selfish part of it is it like it makes my world and everything easier when I have an audience and and have all this going on um in terms of how to think about it like look I'm a capitalist I'm a big believer in incentives and capitalism so like I set mine up like to every like like a good Carpenter wood like every nail requires a hammer right so I'm like okay well I'll turn it into a business and to me I think that's beautiful because I know how to set it and forget it in terms of businesses and then support them in a scalable way and that's what I'm doing with with this particular model another business that I find fascinating just cuz I'm a community guy is scale path that you incubated could you can you explain like what got you excited about that space because that space is just very excit you know is heating up you know last year well going on two years now I made the decision I only want to really work on ideas that could either have an outsized impact on the world or could get to 100 million in Revenue someday so the idea you know the idea of selecting for ideas went through that lens um you know what we saw with scale path is we very much like deployed the effectuation model that I used to build companies which is like I went and looked at the things that we have available to us you know in terms of our current resources and the change we could make on the world and you know I saw that I've created a bit of a voice around small business operations leadership ownership all that kind of stuff so there's that level of trust that I felt like we could start with and use that to go build a business around so using the associate model um that I used to basically bring on entrepreneurial apprentices um you know Sam who is the CEO of scale path he and I like dug into that particular idea after going through three other ideas over the previous six months that all sucked uh we dug into that idea and Sam and I went and interviewed a bunch of potential customers and what we saw was in the small business space like there were a bunch of people that were like stuck in their business they wanted to like grow both the business and themselves but they didn't know how to like get past it so we did like straight up like Lean Startup like interviews with them like what matters to you what are your priorities what are you solving for and we heard like the same things over and over again they're like you know I want to grow my business but I don't have time to go to EO or vistage um and spend like a whole day doing that kind of stuff and also they expect me to show up and know a bunch of things that I don't know already like how to hire people how to fire how to select a lawyer like none of that there's no class that teach you all that stuff unless you have a parent like I did who like teaches you how to do it and so what Sam and I saw was there was this niche of people running these businesses 500,000 to 5 million wanted to grow but there wasn't anything out there for them um and they didn't want like to go sign up for a marketing course they wanted just like tell me what to do give me a recipe on how to solve this problem that every business has and so from that we went and like set up the business and it's you know you pay a monthly fee you join the CEO pure Network and the unique thing that we've done is create these playbooks that we're releasing now two per week and it's everything from like how do I hire a lawyer to like how do I fire someone to like how do I do cash planning for my business and you get you come for that stuff and then you stay for the community and we've built a community around that that's um I think very vibrant now compared to a lot of other ones I've been in super engaged um and and it's going off really well we're on month number five and adding new members like you know every couple days which to me is pretty exciting yeah it reminds me in some ways similar to Trends the by the hustle people came for some of these playbooks um but then stayed for the community um although their Community was on Facebook groups do you yours sounds like it's more like Zoom discussions maybe hosted by a moderator is that how it works uh people what actually interestingly enough when people are in this kind of 500 to5 million do stage like they're they're working in the business like they generally can't leave so what they'll tell you is they want something asynchronous so we're all slack Centric and then what Sam does um and and I'm part of this is uh we'll have a couple of synchronous events per week and those could be things like we'll bring in an expert who wants to talk about like you know how audits work and like that'll be that particular thing or a Q&A around one of the playbooks will do will do that as well and he's built up a roster of these experts there's like a sales one and then um we have one around uh banking like there are all kinds of folks that he's brought into this network now so it's mostly asynchronous but then there's the synchronous aspect of it as well as how we do it and it's all slack Centric slack and and basically we use an online portal for the um the actual like playbooks themselves and so far it's worked really well have you heard of everything marketplaces decom no so check it out I just find it a fascinating model so if you go to their website I'm not involved or anything like that I just find it they did a great job uh it says work Community for Marketplace Founders and leaders so first of all you would think that is like super Niche um and it is but they've they this came out of a venture Studio I believe and the way any well first let me explain the product so basically the way it works is you get access to this you know Community they have events they have a knowledge Hub and resources um so I'm sure some Playbook type stuff and just different guides tutorials toolkits investor database so like who are the most active Marketplace investors and they've got 1,800 people I I know that they're making I had heard that you know they're in the seven figure Revenue range which is really amazing and this I think it was came out of a venture Studio where they were working on multiple products but this was working so well the team was just like let's just focus on everything marketplaces it's like every Venture Studio does that yeah exactly so I feel like this model that people like you and everything marketplaces are pioneering is is only going to get more and more popular yeah and look we what re I don't know if you're familiar with reforge like and what that does for like you know Tech continuing Edge like or Ed you know what scale path really wants to be is reforge for small business like that's what we're planning on doing so we've got a good chance getting there I'm excited about it how does how does reforge work man I think it's a good question I think you end up showing up and buying like it's the $2,000 last I saw it was the $2,000 a year and you get like a level of basic stuff and then I think there's some add-on courses that you can pay so basically they've they've optimized everything for most uh employees have a $2,000 educational budget and they like use all of it what's really cool I'm just on their website right now they they have they've raised money from Anders and harowitz and all that kind of stuff that's their first mistake yeah I mean I would have just not raised money um but this artifacts piece that they're doing is really cool so they have like you could you know this is really cool so they basically list out uh you know board survey at kry first user interview cards at cly Holy Trinity of Dev Team Planning at fractal so they're basically getting all these product onepage brief at brilliant smart home so they're getting all these assets from these companies and they're just you can just download them and this is really cool yeah so the pricing is $2,000 for a person you get one seat and you get to join one cohort and then then they have corporate plans on top of that interesting yeah I mean great great business this looks really smart and probably producing a ton of value for folks I just don't know if they I would have raised money for this business it's like an incredible not rais money business but maybe they could make it work yeah well like you it's like do you want to Own 100% of a great business or do you want to own 40% of a great business and I think there's this interesting category of ideas and it's a lot of your businesses too that don't need a lot of capital to grow quickly and you know marketplaces communities um to some extent agencies if you can get in the right Niche like they all check that bucket and to me like that's the other thing I've learned over the past 15 years like I don't really want to be in a bunch more heavy capex businesses because it turns out they eat up all your Capital which totally which totally sucks was the fireworks business that you started or you're involved I mean tell the story about I think it's Alamo Fireworks how did you get involved in the fireworks business uh it's it's the one thing that doesn't look like everything else so yeah so I got in the fireworks business I'm actually the fourth generation Gridley in the fireworks business fifth if you count my you know by marriage um so my great great great uncle sold fireworks door Todo with a hand card in Kansas back in the 20s and then my grandfather came back from the war uh and the war being World War II he was in the Navy in the Pacific he and his wife my grandmother moved down to San Antonio because they wanted a slower pace of life and that is San Antonio it is a slower place of Life place it is the anti- Miami let's put it that way um and so they got into the wholesale and retailing of fireworks my grandfather was the first person to import fireworks directly from China into Texas uh so that was a pretty cool aspect of that and then my dad joined the business in the 70s he grew it significantly from just a handful of retail locations to um much bigger well you know well into the hundreds and then my brother and I got involved in the 2000s I was the CEO for8 years uh and that is a very difficult business to run it's super high complexity very difficult for a lot of reasons and um the business is where it is now today we 37 stores around Texas hundreds of locations that are temporary uh pretty significant you know amongst the top two or three vendors in the state so um I got involved in it because my dad wanted to retire he uh you know recruited my brother and I to come in and you know I got into entrepreneurship the oldfashioned way daddy so so that's and he and he didn't want to sell the business he wanted to share it with his children uh he had flirted with um flirted with selling it um but I think ultimately like you know it was a win-win for everybody I got to come back from California I got to live I think a really good life my wife and I are are super happy here and uh you know he got to stay you know involved um he's significantly involved in the business he's a landlord for us and um you know it's a if you can figure out how to do family business with family I think it's like a superpower for the family you get to really have you know some interactions that normally you don't have the danger is family businesses have a way of like exploding families so you really have to be careful and navigate the whole thing so you know we spend a lot of effort trying to communicate well as a family get along well be transparent open and and that's the way to make a family business work was the exploding families line there a fireworks pun or were you just using no that's incredible though yeah no I've heard them all you know that's an explosive business sales must be skyrocketing right you know on and on and on uh since I was a kid so yeah what's what's something you love about that business and what's something that you don't like about that business like there must be uh some yeah go ahead no no go ahead I was just going to say like as a tech person I don't think much about the you know the fireworks business and I'm sure there is some redeeming qualities to it in terms of like you know it's probably making money Etc yeah look I think fireworks is a great example of um you know businesses that are kind of beautiful and and also challenging in the same way you know like believe it or not the consumer Dynamics create real interesting Moes for a retailer that often other retailers don't have um you know we have brand Affinity with people uh but also just the customer dynamic they all mostly shop on a couple days a year um so that creates opportunities if you own real estate you can potentially you know in the right places you can potentially do really well for for your life um but look I also love that you know that business is one that is a great business we've got a great team um it's created opportunities for the CEO the CFO uh the CEO as well and um you know it it puts food on the family on the tables for you know multiple girdley family members and I think ultimately like that was one of the Transformations I had to make as an entrepreneur like I think it's easy to start as an entrepreneur and your business you serve the business right because that's what happens when you're trying to get off the ground and it's easy to forget as the business grows that ultimately the business needs to switch to serving you and I think the business that you know that business taught me that lesson of like oh okay like at a certain point like this business exist to serve me the owner rather than for me to service it and you know I thought that was a great lesson you that it served um things that I don't like you know like look it's much more fun to be in businesses that like fire officials and police officers and public officials like want to have a around like the the first business I started that that wasn't fireworks like like the fire inspector came in and he was like Hey like uh okay well you guys are pretty close like you're you're past like just call me when you fix that one thing you're open and I was like what is this like these guys were never this nice when we were selling fireworks and it's because they just you know they had this attitude that just wasn't as nice so you know it it it taught me that there's uh it taught me ultimately the thing that matters most in business is not how well I run a business it is what game am I playing like I would much rather play a really good game and be in a super good business and do that not very good than to be the best at a really hard business because the hard business always wins and I would rather just I'd rather at this point in life I just want to play easy games and definitely be in that business taught me that I feel like Dura software is a very good business to be in like the business of buying hyper Niche software I mean constellation software I've been following them for the last five or so years and they're just so such a great business um what do you think of what do you think of constellation software have you spent much time just looking at what they're up to tons of time I mean there is there is a thesis right now that there are going to be a lot more consolation style you know hold codes and rollups happening um especially ones that are just holding for yield rather than for appreciation right which is what like what Dura does right like we're we're cash flow buyers and so like I think constellation and Mark Leonard and the things that those guys have invented and then the level they've taken it to like it's just ungodly like like most people don't understand the level of just what mark Leonard and his team Mark Leonard is the CEO and founder of it former VC like what they've done through like 25 years of just inward focus of like how do we optimize every part of like learning and feedback and the acquisition model and keeping track of potential Acquisitions and like organizing it and then all of that like they just do it at such a high level compared to the smaller aggregators of which we're one right and someday we want to get there but like for example their feedback process of how do postacquisition like you know reflection to do better for the next one is like over the top like it's just like standardized beautiful data Centric just like all the stuff you want and that's because Mark is really smart he's not in there trying to run those companies he's in there trying to do two things which is you know manage the culture of that business and have the right learning culture there and then second create the systems around that to facilitate that learning culture and so holding everybody accountable around that just I mean just the dude's like a super genius like it's when I look at it I'm like okay that guy's really really good like someday someday I want to get that good um and we'll see he's been doing it for 25 years we've been doing it for five you know we got a long way to go and and I'm optimistic could you can you explain just like what they do for the for folks who don't know much about constellation software and just a primer on on yeah what's a primer on Constellation software what do you need to know if you're interested in in building a a mini constellation yeah 100% um so software is a surprisingly shockingly huge Global Market it's 600 million plus uh a year or 600 billion sorry a year in Revenue so it's like just this enormous thing globally and software is by far the greatest business model in history right you have sticky customers high gross margin uh you have predictable Revenue you write it once you keep selling it forever like all of those things like are are amazing right um so what constellation realized when they first got started is there's two types of software there's vertical software which is software that goes towards a specific industry so it might go to like the Pet Care industry or it might go to the insurance industry and then there's horizontal software and horizontal software is stuff like Microsoft Word like it sells across every single industry and what constellation realized early on is that this vertical Market software was super powerful you could go buy this stuff you immediately had pricing power you had durable Revenue like you could generate cash you didn't have to reinvests in the business really to grow it like these are all beautiful things so what they did instead of trying to write and create vertical Market software was they went out and started acquiring these companies and he raised $25 million from um was it cpers it was Omar's or whatever the Ontario pension fund I yeah omers yeah and so that's how they got started they kept doing that compounding buying got it was relatively slow for the first 10 years and then the snowball kept going because they would take the cash from these Acquisitions and go use that to buy more companies and eventually they're where they are today which I haven't even looked at the market cap recently but it's it's probably close to 100 billion um they're generating just tons of cash and now they've just turned into a giant you know vacuum cleaner that just goes around the world buying software everywhere from North America Canada Europe Australia they have all these divisions and they've segregated them into vertical Market groups depending upon the vertical that they're going after and uh it's just turned into this really beautiful kind of cast generation machine um that is U it does this at scale and I think I don't even know the exact number but I think they acquired like a billion dollars in Revenue last year I mean just something just like they did an acquisition like every day like just ungodly and they're doing them all like you know mostly small 10 five 10 million in Revenue with some bigger chunks but like just c a crazy velocity and it's turned to this giant Behemoth all done out of Toronto yeah they uh if you look at their stock chart it's literally up in to the right they're at an all-time high uh their stock is up just about 10,000% since 2009 10,000% real stocks are up 50,000% yeah exactly come on come on Mark come on Leonard get get back to work Buddy he's also like an epic looking guy right yeah he's got this J yeah have you ever met him or no no not all Canadians know each other girley yeah I thought you guys just hung out out the Tim Hortons um yeah so uh yeah he's got like this so Mark linard is like this like this very reclusive guy he rarely goes into the public and part of the reason is a I think he doesn't like it but B you can see in his shareholder letters he got sick of going and telling people how to do stuff in public and then they would copy him and compete with them and and he did not appreciate that so he doesn't do hardly any interviews anymore and the ones that you see are like few and far between it'll be like some grainy cell phone camera where he's like T taken in a room and um yeah so he's like a reclusive guy he refused to fly anything but economy class for until recently he's also like my size uh in terms of height and also like much wider like I think he out weighs Me by like 50 or 60 pounds and then the best part is he has like this giant Gandalf the wizard beard and uh it just makes him seem like he's just like an oracle like a sage like he's Rick imagine Rick Rubin but he's doing software that's what you end up with exactly yeah he's a rick rubben meets Gandalf software Canadian look guy so he's you you love to see that you know his he's got a crazy looking Vibe about him and and sometimes you need that I mean when he decided what you know when he started consolation what he was doing was crazy right like it was definitely Against the Grain so and I love that he declined like he's declining media interviews he's he's do you know he's a clus you know it's he's an interesting character I think he is I think Mark is a perfect example of the power you get from maniacal Focus for decades at a time like I think you know I think we keep talking about this issue you and I have talked about it on Twitter a lot like you know are you willing to go do something for decades at a time and if you're willing to do that like you're basically Unstoppable because 99.9% of the planet is totally incapable of investing more than a couple hours and something and if you could do it for a couple decades like you're guaranteed to win and uh like I think that's that's the biggest takeaway for me watching Mark is like oh if I'm gonna do something like I want to play multi- deade games I don't want to play like multi-year games not as much fun so what's the this is a good place to end what is the multi-decade plan for Michael girley and and companies yeah well I think there's there's two answers for you which is like I'm getting ready to turn 49 and I don't think I have it figured out like I went on a retreat like last week and like they asked my my two issues were I was like oh I'm figuring out this media thing and like I'm trying to figure out what my life's going to look like you know 15 to 18 years from now when I'm in my late 60s and frankly I just don't really know like I haven't figured it out and that's one of the things I started last year was just kind of thinking about what do I want my life to look like where am I gonna be you know am I traveling around who am I with what am I working on what risk profile do I have what are you know what is my interaction model with my kids and all that kind of stuff like what does that look like I just I'll be totally straightforward yet like I don't know like I got to spend the next year or so kind of figuring out because that that 20-year thing is I it seems soon right I'm 48 and 68 will'll be here soon you know in terms of the business plan the business plan is doing more of exactly what I'm doing like I am uh I am you know working with the companies that I'm already in you know I hate to use the word portfolio but it's the portfolio and I'm working on it and they're growing and and they're gonna I think we're gonna have 100% success rate there um but I think you know the thing I want to work on for the next 10 years is creating more huge ideas whether that's buying companies where that's creating companies that buy more companies or whether it's incubating things like scale path you know or or Staffing Company near that are going to turn into you know big impactful things like I only want to work on that stuff like I don't want to launch anything that's small um I only want to do stuff that I think is g to change the world and get really big someday at this point and maybe that's just a factor of being almost 50 like I see I see the end is coming and I'm just G to do more of that and I love that because it makes my life like so much easier like I just no to so much stuff now because I'm like I'm just doing that and otherwise I say no and yeah it gives me a lot of Peace going back to the I don't know answer that you have for yourself I think there's so many of us who don't know what they want to be doing in 5 10 15 20 years how do you how do you turn question marks into periods and answer some of those hard questions yeah for me for me I I take time to make really difficult decisions like that and I gather a lot of data I think about them a lot um lots of long walks and that sort of thing and then I talk to smart people like you did to get their opinion on it so I'm in CEO peer groups um I put it out there that I'm still thinking about it I guarantee I'm G to get some messages with input on it I'll probably talk about it on Twitter at some point that was the best thing I did this week actually I just you know I put some advice that I had gotten from other people out on Twitter and asked for other people's opinions like it makes for great content but it also like helps me figure stuff out and so over the coming months like I think I'll develop a vision of where I want to be you know 20 years from now um which that's what I think I haven't figured out and then once I figure that out it'll be straightforward I'll just make a plan on how to get there but right now it's data Gathering data Gathering will turn into really listening to what my soul says I need to be doing 20 years from now paint a vision of that and then figure out a plan so that's really a three-step process um says easy does hard is what I would say about that process though I like it and last thing before before we leave what's this what's this chili thing like where where does this connection with Chili's come from and basically for for folks who don't know Michael girdley is a must follow on Twitter but just so you know you're getting 10 or 15% of his tweets to be chili Chili's related tweets I need to cut down look for me um for me I I have some views of the world that I think are important and and Chile's like yeah it's kind of goofy and I'm a pretty goofy guy and I'm happy to be out there as a goofy guy but I think also there's this idea of how I feel about Chile that how I kind of feel about the part of America that I live in and I think America to some extent is so focused on a number of things but one of them is like I've always felt kind of a resentment to thinking that you know this idea that everything has to be special it has to be like a Michelin star to be beautiful right or it has to be handcrafted in Downtown LA for it to be great right or it has to be this extreme thing and you know you got to go to Burning Man to find peace like that to me it's just like you know there's joy to be found in many places and I think all those things are beautiful and I think all those things are great but when I like think about Chile's or I joke about it it's really that feeling like I when if I go into a Chili's like there are people who are nowhere near Twitter nowhere near the world you and I live in and they're just there with their family like enjoying a beer or like relaxing over lunch or spending time with a colleague after you know after hours and to me like just normal people in flyover America like just living life where it's yeah it's easy it's the same every place you go into I think there's just as much Beauty in that as you find in you know a a Brooklyn you know a Brooklyn canery right or an LA kind of club scene that is the one place in the world that only people get into like I think there's Beauty throughout all of that and it all comes down to for me like making sure you take a moment to slow down and find that beauty because even though it's uniform and every single Chili's looks the same just like every single exit off of American Interstate like I find I find it beautiful that people are able to be special and human and connect with each other in a place like that and do it easily in a way that that works for them so that's when you see me joking about Chili's that's what I'm actually thinking in my heart I'm like man like every all those Coastal people hate this but like there's Beauty here and they're just missing it I love it and I also think that in a world where especially on on X Twitter so much the content feels like chat GPT like the fact that you're like whenever I see you tweet about Chili's I'm like at least he's black that guy no no no no no no I'm kind of like I'm kind of like all right all right this is not AI content right here I know that you know this is human this is Michael girley behind behind this account so for me it's like a verification that that you yeah yeah and and and to be honest it makes me feel as a as a audience member like more connected to you and you know I really I feel like I understand you more from from those quirks so I think people should be more quirky on on places like X I think it's I for people that are in My Generation generation x like I go talk to all my friends and uh I'm gonna write it I'm gonna write a front about this about how like there's such an empty Gap where like if you would actually be one of the people in their 40s or 50s who's learned some stuff and it's like willing to put yourself out there and be a little bit vulnerable like it is such a blue ocean for us like like we have such an opportunity to share and connect and that's what H that's what that's how I think about social media but like my friends are terrified they're like what if I say something stupid I'm like well then you apologize it's pretty straightforward that's just like real life and uh like I think there's such an opportunity there to go and be a real person um just because nobody else in my generation is capable of doing it like we just were just wired to keep our mouth shut because you know I don't know why maybe the Boomers told us we had to do it but like I think it's such an opportunity and um anyway I don't know I I wish more well actually no more people should not do it because it would be harder for me so yeah you guys stay at home and keep watching Fox News it'll be fine where could people follow you for more Chili's and holdco and business related content yeah 100 perc uh well I don't know if I told you Greg but I am a YouTuber now so you can go to my YouTube channel I am working hard to get good at video it is very humbling we've recorded 10 things and I've thrown away half of them uh so you can search on uh anywhere on Google girdley I will get you to my website or you can go on YouTube to girdley

For many leaders and entrepreneurs, being the go-to person for answers is second nature.

But what happens when they step out of the spotlight and into a circle of peers?

It's a transformative experience to transition from leading to actively participating, listening, and learning.

This not only fosters trust but also opens up a space for genuine feedback.

Learn from Antonio Neves’ experience how embracing such moments can be pivotal for growth.

I think for leaders and entrepreneurs who are building things nine times out of ten you know they look to be the individuals or they're the individuals that everybody comes to and assumes they're going to have the answers very rarely can they find them in a space of peers where they're not leading where they can actually participate they can get feedback they can learn and not be the drivers it's building trust and it's also just being open to the feedback because sometimes you don't know someone well you're willing to hear that

what we did is we rented a mansion in LA we got a private chef and we were there for 72 hours and you moderated the whole thing and the way it worked was everyone would wear their heart on their sleeve and say what's going well with their business what's not going well why do you think that format works so well one it was intimate two in some shape or form trust had been established not everyone in that room had met one another at the previously so they had trust because Greg knows this person or Dario knows this person but also it was very clear what the intention was I think a lot of times the reason why masterminds and these type of group things don't succeed or people don't get value out of them is because there aren't clear intentions there aren't clear metrics kpis why we are here

when I thought about what it meant to throw an event maybe years ago it's like oh it's so expensive like you need sponsors you know everything you need to do open bar you need to do this like overthinking it you don't need to do any of those things yes you can yes you can build it up to that you need to host have the space and whatever you negotiate from there is great people are just very excited to go to something like that it doesn't matter that they're gonna have to pay for drinks that's fine if you don't have a sponsor don't want to cover the cost for people's drinks or the venue or whatever that's fine like there there isn't this expectation or anything I think you just need to go that Mile and host what do you what are you pouring I hear you pouring a beverage uh I am I'm pouring the most prestigious and pristine sparkling water that I found in my journey for said product uh it is the Saratoga Springs sparkling water you know the quality with the blue bottle not Financial advice not an investor I'm also drinking some sparkling water you know about this Arc I don't know about this what is this it's like it's like a Sodastream but way more beautiful looking and so also not sponsored or anything like that I'm saying I'm trying to one-up you I'm saying you did I mean it's more environmental and you know I can just less waste see I see where you're going with this but I gotta be honest with you I'm not just drinking sparkling water I'm also drinking it with Como's tequila excuse you all right then fine I will crack open the bottle of body vodka okay it's gonna be one of those podcasts if you're gonna start the opening trying to one-up me I'm not not going to feel threatened and try and over compensate yeah I'm looking forward to this podcast this is gonna be good okay while you pour yourself a drink am as well you pour yourself a drink I uh I checked your LinkedIn before this and you have it could go a few ways yeah my LinkedIn is either the worst thing um in the world or the best pre-qualifier for who I want to work with or not yeah well well usually I'd like to introduce people your your title is insert very important Title Here at vaynerfund what is what does that mean that's that is accurate it is it's not really important what the title is uh in our little fund I guess um it could be partner it could be janitor it could be anything but whatever it is it is very important and I want people to know that that I am very very important at vaynerfund but it's actually just a litmus test because one of my life models is don't take life too seriously you'll never get out alive and I think that being the Marquee title on my LinkedIn stresses that so I I truly don't take it that seriously I don't care how important anyone thinks I am but if you can't take the joke and you scoff at that title we're probably not going to work well together exactly and that's the reason I wanted to bring you on is because I think you live a really happy and good life and you don't take things too seriously and you kind of just go with your curiosity and I'm curious just like is that intentional and and yeah how do you think about crafting your life definitely um it is absolutely intentional at this point um I think it was subconscious prior to recent years I'd say but now I take a very active role in I guess just a value evaluating how happy things make me from a business perspective but also from a life perspective because it has been drilled home that what do you know we only have one life I won't go so far as to quote our beloved neighbor to the north um we all know what I would say but um had a minor Health incident that wound up not being a big deal at all that I'm aware of because the doctor did uh close the loop on that by saying I guess we'll just call it a medical mystery which was not very comforting but as far as I know totally fine happened last year but it really put life in perspective because at for a brief moment at a time I genuinely was convinced I was going to die and that reframed so much for me where it's like oh how could you not want to just optimize for being happy every single day of your life because it's the most important thing and like you're the one that has to wake up and live in your body every day so you gotta go you first so I saw I saw a tick tock video as I was like I don't know it's like two in the morning I know you don't have Tick Tock and maybe that plays a role into your how into your happiness but I was like I was like trying to fall asleep it was like two in the morning I'm like swipe swipe swipe and I get this video of like why why are dogs always happy and apparently you know this whole Tick Tock around like well they you know for every one week that a human lives or sorry for one day that is the equivalent to one week for a human so basically dogs know their own mortality and they know that you know their life is short so they're just by definition like you know when you leave even if you leave uh your apartment to go get like the the mail or something or coffee or gone for two minutes your dog coming back to you and and they're like stoked to see it it's like oh my God where Bill where have you been and I feel which is which is great like everyone go get a dog um completely what do you think yeah what do you think about that do you think like this new like almost like having a lease on life kind of kind of just chain it just changed your perspective and now like what what concretely did you change in your life after after you had this new lease on life I ate that Tick Tock does resonate with me it doesn't push me so far is to sign up but I do like that I like that that exists and Rings very true but I guess I guess the new new lease on life um I would say it empowered me to say no more and say no more confidently because I just felt confident in saying this doesn't suit me right now and or ever and that's speaking in generalities but I think just empowering me to take control where I know I can take control and that's that's a really beautiful thing could you give an example of something that you said no to over the last year and something that you said yes to that you might have not five years ago definitely um I think best example is perpetually attempting to eliminate the word should from just overall commitments in everyday life there are certain things that we all have to do that maybe we don't want to do and I'm not saying you can just completely throw everything to a whim and I don't want to do this so I don't have to do it there are things you have to do but having an honest conversation with yourself around are you just doing this because you think you have to do it or because you have to do it so the easiest thing is mostly cutting out networking events and those have always been somewhat of a bane of my existence because in the field of venture capital kind of important to schmooze and network and mingle but it's usually done with a lack of intention that I think is detrimental um I'll go so far as to say to your mental health because you're kind of floating around you show up to this event whether or not you drink doesn't matter but you're just showing up with no real goal and hopefully meeting people and then you have folks just like staring at the name tag if there's a name tag and oh you're not important or I don't think you're important or whatever and it's just kind of soul-crushing so really looking at how you spend your time and showing up in person is a really powerful thing in my opinion so you should only be showing up if you actually want to show up um because people can tell and you just lead a happier life do you yeah like if you're if you're trying to make it like in startups or Venture like do you need to go to networking events because both of us don't really both of us don't go to networking events really like I think yeah I think our Vibe is just like incorrectly I'm wrong our Vibe is like we'll just like bring together interesting people and good things happen but it's it's more just like among friends like it's never like yeah yeah although we did meet at South by Southwest and but that was that was before that's like we're talking 2010 2011. that's who knows yeah exactly what do we know why yeah thank you what did we know yeah knowing what you know now Phil do you need to go to networking events if you want your best shot to win at startups or Venture I think it's it's yes and no I think you still have to show up places I think if you are showing up intentionally at certain events that are hyper specific to what you're interested in um I think that's great I think you can pre-curate um a hat tip to what you're passionate about what I know you're excellent out which is community I think you can find a sub Community or two either on Reddit or on X now or something and go to events either online or in person in that Circle kind of to the point that you said like we like to only go with friends well usually our friends know interesting people and one of my favorite things to do is to to host a small event where it's like hey you show up bring one person that nobody knows or you think nobody knows and say that to 10 to 20 people and what do you know you have a 50 person event but it's really close-knit intentional I brought this person because and I think that's a much more interesting way to go about it but if you are trying to get your start and you're trying to break in I think you find you find are you trying to narrow in on what you're looking for a bit first rather than the broad I want to break into Tech but like what sector do you want to be an engineer do you want to aspirationally be a CEO one day do you just want to be a CEO or you have ideas something hone in on what it is and find the sub community and I think that's a really powerful and interesting way to go about it because you can learn a lot more that way I think totally and also like the host is underrated right like if you're the host it's like if you if you're the person reaching out to people and being like hey I'm curating this dinner of like d2c Founders in New York who have between one and five million a year in Revenue it's like even if you're not one of those people but you're trying to be one of those people like it's it's I feel like it's a pretty good move yep and people remember that you bring people together and that holds a special place uh in people's hearts and it's it's really nice to facilitate that I personally enjoy that feeling quite a bit and I'd say even to this day it happened maybe two days ago the listeners don't know this but they're gonna know now we co-hosted an orange wine party in Brooklyn right before the pandemic yeah somebody literally brought it up to me yesterday that was a plus one saying how fun it was and this happened in 2019 and it was pretty low lift from our part and it was awesome yeah we did however I full disclosure we did bring the covid-19 virus uh to America and and spread it across the world because it was January 2020 I think and uh we did have one member the DJ in fact Tyler lemko comedian Tyler lemko did spread that were using names oh you know I thought we're having like a you know an honest conversation open honest yeah I appreciate the transparency yeah the comos I guess is starting to hit he hasn't officially yeah maybe but that that also hasn't been confirmed nor denied I'd say right but there is a lot of data suggesting that it may not have been it wasn't not not a super spreader event totally but we didn't know yeah but we didn't know uh so but yeah I mean I also randomly get like people people hit you know mentioning that that of those events and that event and uh it pays dividend both like work wise and just like personal like some of my happiest moments have been throwing these events and I feel like people people listening should just like don't go to events throw events yeah like to summarize like I I think that's great advice Okay cool so dude do what you would do I mean do what you do just trying to get on a call with somebody if you don't know a group of folks like slide in the DMS respectfully have a plan on the event doesn't have to be a blockbuster thing you don't have to spend a ton of money it could literally be a meet up in your City's local park of marketing minds or something or whatever Niche you you kind of want to touch on doesn't have to cost a lot of money it doesn't have to involve drinking you can craft your own event and just see who shows up invite people and see who show up it's as simple as that and maybe nobody shows up and that's fine too and figure out what went wrong product product test on your event invites and yeah iterate totally what's okay actually let's go back to so that's something that you learned I guess in your 20s no networking events be the host um so you're saying no to networking events what's what's something that you're saying yes to more of these no no two no to I think no networking events is too rigid I think no two attending events without intention I would say yeah yeah so what's an example of a yes um an example of a yes obviously I mean it's a unique experiences where something's curated or it's a Once not necessarily once in a lifetime thing but it's a very unique opportunity where you wouldn't otherwise do something specific example to stop being so vague this isn't in the past year or so but um a few years back I I was at a group dinner curated dinner great awesome on theme with what we're talking about uh this gentleman uh wearing a very wacky Blazer hindsight it wasn't that wacky but in the moment I was like oh this is a pretty cool fashion combo way to go guy talk to him for maybe 10 15 minutes and he invited me in a few weeks to his birthday party the birthday party was a bit unconventional because it was a three-day event and it wasn't hosted in New York City or where we met he was going to host a large group of people in Tulsa Oklahoma and program an entire trip to Tulsa to show the city because there's a huge entrepreneurial Vibe he was leading the charge on awareness around Tulsa's a hub for business and SMB and technology and opening folks eyes to a city they may consider just a flyover situation that in that moment I said yes I'd known this guy for 15 minutes and I couldn't think of another time that I would have just a curated view into the inner workings of Tulsa and I was like yes this sounds interesting worse comes to worse I book a flight and leave early if it's terrible I didn't think it was going to be and I wound up being awesome and I met a lot of incredible people that I'm actually super close friends with to this day so long-winded way to say unique experiences what about that Blazer guy turn you know made you think that this was this you can trust him he I didn't know actually he just he was very personable charismatic I mean the that's that could go negatively obviously because it could wind up being a co-leader but uh had a good vibe cool yeah I think uh I actually said yes to something that I wouldn't otherwise say yes to last week so which is which is I went to a Tony Robbins event last week incredible so I got it fun segue off of what I just said but yeah yeah I mean I wasn't gonna publicly talk about this or even privately talk about it to be honest but here we are um so I went as a guest to the Tony Robbins event it's the business Mastery event which is like more focused on like how do you grow your business so it's yeah I don't know if that makes it any better but that's that's what it is and I was invited to as a guest from Ali abdall who's like a big YouTuber and this guy Joe Gannon who uh helps me with the podcast and a few other you know social content stuff so they invited me they're like hey it's like literally tickets start at ten thousand dollars you're gonna be sitting Courtside like front row and Tony Robbins was literally like spitting on me like I I should have brought an umbrella honestly in retrospect and uh I gotta say one of the better things that I said yes to in the last 12 months is going to this Tony Robbins thing what what's driving that uh and I want to I want to preface it with I always had a lot of mixed feelings about Tony Robbins um because I was kind of like it's he's like a cult leader in a lot of ways and he he feels a bit like I felt at least before going to this he's like a bit um taking advantage of people like selling these crazy expensive uh seminars and like maybe people don't have the money and like bringing them into his quote-unquote cult but I went under the premise of two two reasons I went number one I was like he's probably the greatest sales person ever so I just want to like be in the room with like a world-class salesperson number one and the second thing is if he is leading a cult there's like a fine line between a community and a cult so I want to understand like how he does it right fair right that feels very fair yeah very fair so I I gave up I just curated a hell of a community yes he has he has like say what you want about him like objectively he has so I give up five days of my life to spend it in West Palm Beach and I went to it and it was so good for so many reasons but number one he is the greatest salesperson of all time like how he structures his like the whole seminar and how he like uses music like basically what he does is like he'll like the whole five days he's using like the same five songs over and over again he gets you to like get up and like shout and then like at the point of like Peak state he like comes in and he'll be like oh by the way you should like totally sign up to another seminar of mine you're like so stoked and jazzed yes um so there's yes yeah yes yes yes so he so what he would do like to give you like a concrete example like he would you know let's say we're learning because it was a you know business Mastery let's say we're learning about uh finance and he would be talking about like hey let me go through like Robin's research which is like one of his um companies uh and like the p l from Robin's research and you're going through it and you're like see if I you know if I do these strategies I can increase leads and if I do this and then he after after you know he'll like put like uh Katy Perry's um what's that song what's the big Katy Perry Firework yeah like fireworks come on he would be like it's your company and like fireworks comes on and it's like raise your hand if this is your company and like you're stoked that this is happening to you and everyone's like yeah yeah yeah and then at the end of it he like makes an ask and be like hey by the way like buy my thing um so that's just one example he's an incredible sales person he understands the power of State um and uh I I like it I liked it I thought it was very valuable I also not to put words in your mouth but as you were telling that story I was thinking around and I don't know if this is going to be the next episode theirs or anything but I know you've been very hot on the concept of multipreneur and I would say that is a peak example of multipreneurship where he is essential well not a personal holding company but he like he has a holding company of sorts in every piece he does in and he does I see why that probably resonates with you he's a multipreneur that curates a rabid Community yeah seems like a Greg Eisenberg cup of tea first and foremost yeah I I didn't I actually didn't realize the multipreneur bit until until going so first of all the guys nearly a billionaire didn't know that he co-owns 110 companies that's and like yeah it's wild absolutely Wild and the you know the way it was struck was like the event like it was at Palm Beach Convention Center so there's like the stage in the convention center and then as you're walking in um there's like different booths but the booths are his companies right it's like his accounting firm his legal firm um so he doesn't accept advertisers and sponsors to his events which is like totally like multi-preneur Creator LED sort of entrepreneur vibe is to like obviously sell your own stuff that that seems like the the dream the entrepreneurship dream yeah yeah he's he's definitely doing it um and he's got a lot of subtle ways that he's able to sell people another kind of like interesting thing that I didn't know is if you're going to a Tony Robbins event like bring uh a Canada Goose jacket because he sets the he like I literally walk by the thermostat it's 60 degrees he sets his um 60 degrees Fahrenheit so he sets it to be really cold and the reason he does that is he wants people to like get up and move so that they get like the energy flowing and it's like a Tony Robinson apparently interesting yeah it was that what about 16 degrees Celsius something like that yeah yeah cold be care cold yeah yeah it's cold it's cold temperature called degrees so yeah I think uh overall five years ago 10 years ago would I have said yes to a Tony Robbins event no uh this time said yes learned a lot glad I went I love that you went that's that's fascinating yeah I agree probably one of the greatest salesmen of all time yeah and the interesting thing is while that while the event was happening Alex hermosi who's like a popular like he's really popular do you know you know him now nope okay I love that like I feel like I'm not surprised you don't know him but he's basically so Alex and Rosie wrote a book called 100 million dollar offers it's like how to craft an irresistible offer he's like big on YouTube and I also keep in mind I asked Steph Curry to his face what he did for a living because I just didn't know and I didn't I don't really follow the NBA and this is years ago but that just especially if I don't know somebody that's the worst litmus test I I don't really know if anybody is totally what did Steph Curry say by the way he said he played ball for the Warriors and then we moved on he's so nice you know who co-owns the Warriors Tony Robbins Tony Anthony Robbins I didn't expect the middle name to get in there but no I think it's it's Tony I don't know if his middle name's Anthony no it's it's Anthony Robbins is a co-owner of his 110 companies is uh that's definitely yeah it's wild so all roads lead back to Tony Robbins that's right anyway I I let us astray I'm sorry Alex or Mosey guy went from like zero to millions of subscribers in the last 18 months Milli you know now he went out he got on Twitter like 18 months ago and like now he's tweeting and getting thousands of likes within the first hour he also threw while the Tony Robbins event was happening he threw a launch event for his new book called 100 million dollar leads and he had more than 500 000 people in the live stream at the event wow yeah which is that's wild yeah completely wild and anyone who's interested in like crafting offers or you and or lead like how do you like get leads like you should watch it just because like the same reason I went to Tony Robbins like learn how to be the best sales person of all time Alex hermosi same sort of thing and the interesting thing about Alex hermosi and Tony Robbins is the stage for Alex or Mosey when he was doing his live webinar was the exact same stage that Tony Robbins has where in the back you have all these like Zoom people watching and it's all these like kind of Brady Bunch style you got you gotta check it out so while I was at the event I will while I was at the Tony Robbins event I was like Hey guys did you did you see uh the ultra Mosey event yesterday um and and they were like yeah and I was like doesn't it look like the Tony Robbins set and one of the people I was with said oh Hermosa is like one of the biggest Tony Robbins followers and he specifically crafted his uh stage and vibe to be like a Tony Robbins event which leads me to my thesis that Alex hermosi is the modern day Tony Robbins for young people I I don't think that as much of a stretch based on the facts you have presented yeah so that's my that's my goal I thought you were gonna say initially that you were at the Tony Robbins event in the live stream simultaneously airpod in one ear Tony's spitting on you on the right ear yeah I think that would have been a lot but uh yeah I'll be real with you I'm still like processing I'm still processing the Tony event um I'm sure yeah yeah I'm not a no what uh what's an event that you've gone to over the last year too besides from the Tulsa thing that's really like changed your perception on things and really like because you're always going to events traveling and stuff like that I like to just show up where there's a large cultural event happening not necessarily going to the event itself because a that gets wildly expensive and be you you just don't have to I mean case in point we met at South by Southwest the only time I've ever had a badge to South by Southwest is when for some reason they let me do a panel or speak I've never gotten one on my own but I've gone what eight times at this point you go because it's the largest group Gathering of people that you likely want to know or or are relevant to either your goals or interests or something showing up at a large cultural event and all the ancillary things that happen around it is a huge unlock because you just you go where the people are and you figure it out for the most part but just showing up is is a big piece of it and I feel like I'm stumbling over my words and not quite conveying but uh the Pat I used to make fun of people that would show up at things like that like the Super Bowl or whatever but I I've walked back that stance I have dropped my judgment because now I do it too I don't I don't go to the Super Bowl like the game itself but I show up in the city that it's happening and you go maybe a day earlier leave the morning of and there's a lot of relevant things as long as you know a few other folks going Serendipity lends itself very well to these situations and you wind up leaving with a bunch of either new friends or contacts goals and it is actually wildly productive where I thought that previously it's You're just showing up to party you don't have to party you just have to be there yeah yeah totally and it's like going to these events some sometimes because there's also like you don't want to go to too many events right you want to be someone heads you actually have to work sometimes yeah you have to work sometimes but you know yeah I guess that's a question for you like how what's the right amount of lifting up your head versus putting your head down I mean if you're not going to events three nights ever I'm kidding I have no idea um I I think the balance is different for everyone because sometimes I'll I'll show up places and go to these events and part of it is to meet other people but part of it is also I have learned that exploring new places or going places that I know and just being a part of that event that inspires me creatively and that creativity could mean strategic structuring of an investment or a deal or something or it could mean creating content or a piece of art or thinking about things differently creativity means a lot of different things to me but that inspires me to be my best and makes me happy and I feel top of my game when I'm doing those things so and as long as that feeling persists I'm game to keep bouncing around and and checking things out and I know I know when I'm getting close to my limit and that's when it's time to kind of hunker down and I guess I guess go a bit more heads down but heads down along the way because I mean we can work from anywhere we have the the blessing to be able to do that and as long as you responsibly balance it I mean you just have to listen to yourself yeah I think that's really that's good advice like listening listening to yourself you're good like I feel like inherently you know like oh hey I'm going to too many events I'm tired you know or but I think like thinking about it as like I I like how you kind of think about it as like a dose of inspiration you're like okay I'm gonna go to the Super Bowl because or the super like I'm gonna go to La when the Super Bowl is happening because you know there's these two or three like side events almost that I want to go to and I'm gonna come back like I'm gonna come back to New York with like ready to go and hit the pavement and then like boom heads down one week two weeks three weeks and then you're like okay another thing ready for that dose like thinking about it almost is like a battery and like charging your battery in and it depletes is that how you think about it totally yeah that's exactly right that's it is very battery based and then another point to the whole just show up where things are happening other people are more prone and open to to meeting and engaging so if you there's always something to be done for me and probably you in La there's always like some sort of business deal or some thing we can accomplish if we visit there but the pretense of it being a major cultural event I think people are more apt to meet with you or get that coffee whereas like if you just show up randomly January 21st for no other reason hey I'm in La no sorry I'm busy there's there's there's stuff going on whatever but if you you're there and other people are there for an event and everyone's already in that mode you're more likely to be able to sit down with folks you aspirationally wanted to sit down with or needed to book time with or something there's just um the The receptors are a bit more open I find so it's it's a good hack but isn't isn't the the counter to that like I have a friend who lives in Austin and I actually went to South by Southwest you know what was it six of a few you know five months ago six months ago and yeah and when I texted him he was like dude like you wait you know South by Southwest is so busy like meet me at this dinner uh uh you know and I spoke to him for like 15 minutes he's like why don't you come to Austin when like you know it's it's not touched by Southwest do you find also it's helpful like I feel like going to an event a big event you can kind of get like quick hits of people but like if you really want to spend time with them I don't know if it happens during the big events what do you think oh no I I fully agree with that I think to to deepen or Advance a relationship in a meaningful way like whether it's friendship business whatever it's really it's really tough to do in that setting yeah but I think for the initial contact and kind of yeah the initial contact and making making an inroad I guess it's perfect it's the quick hit like it's great like you see if it's even interesting for the other person for you and then you can take it from there because then you necessarily don't have to be in person you could hop on a zoom FaceTime them you have the open line of communication to text or send a message or send an email and you just have the context of that quick hit and meeting in person that I think is is more important than anything because you're never going to forget the initial feeling of meeting somebody or the initial like 15 minutes that you spent with somebody and as long as that went well the door is open and it's kind of yours to mess up from there and maybe you book a follow-up trip to Austin because you met a bunch of cool people and there's strategic things you can do by revisiting Austin then yeah you can you can further build that relationship and it doesn't necessarily have to be in person so I definitely agree with you that it's really tough to go deep and like build something super meaningful in that context but it opens up way more doors in my opinion to to get that to fill the top of your funnel I'd say for a marketing term what do you think in terms of like closing the funnel or going to the bottom of the funnel I was chatting with someone this morning who was like who's telling me having a place like a secondary home you know in a cool interesting place as a destination to throw events uh she was saying that that's like probably one of the most valuable Investments that you can make because like you can throw like what was it Michael Rubin you saw you through the white party uh that was crazy tell people tell people I know you know what that event was tell people what that event was who Michael Rubin is and why that that was the event of the air Michael Rubin is a wildly successful businessman that has catapulted in popularity in the past few years despite him being a wildly successful businessman for decades now uh I'd say um he's done an absolutely incredible job of tapping into culture as a whole and making sure that he is top of Mind culturally hanging out with the most interesting rappers up and coming rappers musicians television stars surrounding himself with key people and seemingly doing it in an authentic way um where he has established this this white party that he does in July uh every year now as the the event of the year for the most part it's the who's who of relevant folks held at his house in the Hamptons um the the video that was cut up this year from this white party essentially looked like a Hollywood trailer for the most part like it was wild um I was super jealous that Gary got to go um and has gone to go to everyone still don't have that plus one but that's okay um that's that's on me for not being relevant enough but that's fine uh but another point to Michael Rubin in this strategy it's not just him kind of swaggerjacking well that's a terrible term it's not just him trying to commandeer culture and inauthentically just post selfies with famous people like sure he posts that but he did uh have a pretty interesting sound bite where somebody's like well what do you what do you get out of speaking to cuavo or or another rapper or something like what's what's what's the point are you just trying to be relevant he's like well no they have really interesting techniques for how they've either marketed their own music or products that they've sold and it gives him a different perspective to accomplish business challenges that he has as you know in his own business by speaking to these musician musicians because they've obviously been successful in their own right and it's just a thought exercise for him where maybe he can add some value from a business perspective to them and they provide insights that he normally wouldn't have so he's really really intentionally smart around curating that so Michael Rubin just just to be clear he's the founder of Fanatics which brings in billion dollars a year billions in in Revenue they own the licenses to like the NBA NHL stuff like that I'm looking at some of the guests like it's pretty crazy like the guests were Kim Kardashian Jack Harlow Travis Scott Lori Harvey Justin Bieber um like it goes on and on and on I guess like I look at that and I'm like yes obviously he's a incredible businessman and has done really well for himself but like Gary for example like has like in my mind at least like he's on the same level ish and like why isn't Gary throwing the white party right why why like this guy obviously took wanted to it must have been his one of his main his main goal like to to throw an event like this right and was one of his main goals a and and B and that go this goes back to like my earlier point which might not relate to a lot of people but like having the second home as the destination super valuable like I think I'm looking at pictures of his place it's like pretty pretty insane oh it's epic yeah yeah but it goes back to what we started speaking about almost at the beginning where it's be the host and listen to how we're speaking about it right now like it's it obviously makes an impact we have not gone we haven't been invited but now it's maybe this aspirational thing and we see that he is this Beacon that brings together real really relevant people that's really interesting and we're talking about that so that yeah in and of itself I think is pretty important and then I know you mentioned like maybe it's not attainable or accessible for folks to own this own the second home as the destination but I think we can even walk it back quite a bit as a host and have a destination you don't have to own it I mean you know you could have an agreement with a coffee shop or something that where you can host things for free as long as you bring folks in and just to have the ability to be the host and have a destination those are two massive keys and a big unlocks I'd say um I mean when we hosted our party in in Brooklyn and Williamsburg it was we got a free space right at a lot of gerties gerties that's right and they basically were like so picture this listeners because anyone could basically throw their own version of a white party that's that's my come to Jesus moment right now so I agree with you yeah I love where this is going yes basically I started having coffee here and yeah coffee at this coffee shop met the owner he basically was telling me yeah I've got this amazing space downstairs um and I wish someone would use it and I was like well me and Phil might you know could use it and then he was like yeah well you can you know he's a brunch place in a coffee place right like they they close early and he was like if you if you give me a percentage was that how it worked I don't even remember I think we give him like a percentage of yeah he he was operating the bar and we gave him percentage of the bar yeah yeah yeah so which is totally cool for us we got to use this great space and he made money because he wasn't using the space uh actually he was stoked and I remember him in fact he was like oh come back any time like he was so so excited in fact when covet hit he was like oh I wish we you know during like Pete covet he was like yeah they're in a van I was like dude like I don't know but um the point is the point is like you don't need to own the place you need to just you you need to own the mission and you need to own like the idea of the event and and then you know you could knock on some doors get the space and then the space could be an attractive like oh I you know gerties maybe isn't that place but like you know or maybe it is that place what our goal was yeah it was it was perfect yeah but yeah no it was perfect totally agree with you you can and you can do varying scales of this I mean when when I thought about what it meant to throw an event maybe years ago it's like oh it's so expensive like you need sponsors and everything you need to do open bar you need to do this like overthinking it you don't need to do any of those things yes you can yes you can build it up to that I'm pretty sure that the white party didn't have a cash bar sure but you just you need to host have the space and whatever you negotiate from there is great people are just very excited to go to something like that in that context that I mean it doesn't matter that they're gonna have to pay for drinks that's fine if you don't have a sponsor don't want to cover the cost for people's drinks or the venue or whatever that's fine like there there isn't this expectation or anything I think you just need to go that Mile and host yeah No One's Gonna figure everything else out No One's Gonna remember the the cop like the cash bar like that's not what people remember of from the event right they remember and if they do then there probably was something else wrong with the event yeah Charlie if if people are coming to the event because they're getting free free wine or free whatever free food like I don't know if they're there for the mission right and so that's the most commodity of Commodities this is the free food and drink it's like well our event has free food and drink it's like so do the other 10 that I probably found on Groupon so like yeah thoughts exactly so yeah I'm just thinking to myself like man I should be throwing some more events um yeah I am throwing I am going to be throwing some multi-preneur events um which as you should yeah I hope you do one in New York yeah I think um I also think I want to say that we you know IRL is just underrated like IRL events are underrated especially like post covid people are just trying to like people are excited to go to events and so there is an opportunity right now for people for people listening who like your the chance of your event working in 2023 is higher than the chance of your event working in 2019. I agree I totally agree with that and it all is rooted in in what you mentioned like the the purpose the mission why are you holding this event what's the theme as long as you keep that top of mind and and organize it accordingly and curate the right people that you think fit the bill for the room that will would get value on any side of it and you host that it's great before we uh head out give me one or two stories of some of the best events you went to and why they were so so good because I know you've been to a lot of events I think one of the most fun events um this is from years and years ago and I thought about it because you mentioned like why doesn't Gary throw his own white party he did um back in the day he had what was called the secret wine party back in 20 no not even 20 2007 2008 even predates me and we've been working together for 13 years he would um literally roll up to a bar you did this started in South by Southwest say hey I'm gonna bring a bunch of people here is it cool if we just throw a party and they're like yeah yeah okay and just watching it come together was insane on the third iteration like it had done it successfully we bring wine down there would be wine available I won't expand on that because I don't know if it's fully on up and up whatever uh if you can do that in Texas fine but would literally send out a tweet hey secret wine party happening at the address thousand people would show up line out the door and it was so fun and just watching it come together as a community and evolve and then it did get a little weird at one point because people would start following some of us around the city because they thought that we would be sculpting out venues and they'd be trying to get the jump on the the Tweet but um the spontaneity and the the relevance of it just being his community that was super special and very cool to see um another oh one of the the best events that I've been to is was thrown by my friend Dan who I actually met on that Tulsa trip that I mentioned he he is super creative loves bringing people together he created a dinner series that is no longer in the mix where it was an experiential dinner and part part of it was it was all themed and it was course based and there was an activity or a theme per course one of them he had a train going around his dining room table he was wearing a conductor hat of course and the train was carrying arancini and one of the courses was you had to build your own plate and it was a jigsaw puzzle and I was tied into what the the food was being served and that was just so special and memorable and the underlying guest list was hey I invited these five people you all bring one person that no one knows and we'll have a dinner and meet people and the curation and experience was amazing I'll never forget it I hope to replicate it someday but I don't I'm not as big of a Visionary as he is do you remember the dinner you oh my God I just pulling this up I was like what's the name of that guy who because I the craziest dinner I went to was in New York in February 2020 and I just pulled up my email and it was you who invited me and it was at Dan's Place yeah and I was at one of these dinners I'm looking at the environment it wasn't insane so first of all I'm reading the invite now do you think I can read this or is it too like um I think he'd prefer if we didn't okay anyway it's a terrible reference I'm sorry that's let's just say it was it was rule based yes you're looking at the rule flyer exactly that's right what can we say about this dinner that could give people insight into how to throw a really interesting event I can't say what happened at the event correct um no you I think and let's not but yeah the Pinnacle Rule The Pinnacle rule was you cannot talk about work yeah or what you do that's right and that in and of itself was powerful and I think freeing at the same time because I I think a crutch that people tend to use for Better or For Worse is just the first question out of your mouth what do you do yeah that's that's a pretty loaded question and usually the context means like what do you do for work but it could be anything but eliminating that I think is really key especially in a place like New York where there's a lot you know yeah do I don't I don't even need to explain that and I guess like that's you know bring it all back like insert very important Title Here at vaynerfund that's why you're like okay the re like real people will will get it and you'll hopefully you know you'll be you know maybe that's like the best way to do it like to get like really interesting people to attract you know attracted to you maybe yeah so some takeaways I have from this is one be the host uh two be like Dan and create something that's unique and interesting and unlike everything else out there uh three go to go to you don't need to go to the event like you don't need to go to the Super Bowl but there's something that magical happens at some of these bigger events where it's like go to the side of it don't go to the main event and um I don't know if you're familiar sorry to throw you off from you're taking it but group chat if you're familiar it's drama D Murthy and on on they have a term called boondoggling and that's what uh essentially showing up at the major cultural event and just kind of being there and not necessarily going to the event itself they call that boondoggling and that I think is a pretty interesting I mean I like the word I like the word yeah yeah so boondoggling and then I think it's just taking stock and what and what you're saying yes to and what you're saying no to and being okay intention yeah setting attention that's really that's very Tony Robbins of you Phil hmm well well and then last but not least like in terms of Entrepreneurship like Tony Robbins in terms of Entrepreneurship and sales you know prowess like go go watch Tony Robbins and listen to him just as like you don't have to listen to what he's saying but just like in the fact that like understanding his techniques for talking and selling is just and creating events is mind-blowing and and same with the Alex her Mosey event like go watch out listen to that and it's no matter what you're doing like it will be it will help you become a better salesperson and and life is sales so so it's a good skill to know life is sales it's mic drop mic drop Phil Toronto one of my one of my closest friends it's an honor to have you here and jam on on this sort of stuff people you're you're kind of you're

Title: The Secrets To Effective Mastermind Groups
Published: 2023-08-30 14:00:01 UTC
Description:
https://www.youtube.com/@GregIsenberg

The term "mastermind" may feel outdated, but the essence behind it remains as powerful as ever.

According to Antonio Neves, founder of the Man Morning community, when organizing group sessions to brainstorm, ideate, or build, there are key elements to consider.

These include limiting the group size, having a structured format, and most importantly, introducing a skilled facilitator to guide the conversation.

Nailing all of these elements guarantees a successful, modern-day mastermind group that can support and lift people up.

what advice could you give to people who want to start their own Mastermind like that one you probably want to drop the word Mastermind because I think in these day and ages I think it scares people more than it actually excites them some recommendations first and foremost six to eight people Max second you want to have a facilitator some type of coach or person that's guiding and leading the conversation taking notes on the Whiteboard have a strong format to the day uh pretty much standard format for us is what someone would get the opportunity to present about what they're working on for 30 or 45 minutes and then we'd have a build session after that where we dig into it we ask questions we provide feedback make sure you don't have to think about things you don't want to think about

Title: The Secret Twitter Hack To Go Viral, With Nick Huber
Published: 2023-08-29 14:00:21 UTC
Description:
Nick Huber regularly goes viral on X (formally Twitter) for his meme like posts that spark hilarious comments.

But as Nick explains, going viral doesn’t really get you any follower growth online.

There’s a misconception that going viral on social media is the ultimate growth hack. Yes, it gets you clicks and views, but these don’t translate to sales or dollars.

Tweets that teach, share wisdom, or just make you think will actually stick around and wave at more eyes.

Title: Most People DON’T Want To See You Win, Explains Nick Huber
Published: 2023-08-27 14:00:15 UTC
Description:
Your network is your net worth.

Nick Huber and I are in a group with the likes of Sahil Bloom, Austin Rief, Sam Parr, and Nikita Bier.

It’s easy to be surrounded by people who don’t want to see you win, and are envious of your success.

It’s much more rare to be surrounded by people who all have the same positive mindset, and are all crushing it.

If you want to grow and run a successful business, create a network that empowers and uplifts you.

Collaboration breeds triumph.

when you have people with a positive mindset and they love to see each other win it's abnormal most of the time when people crush it they're surrounded by people who obviously proximity wise are not all crushing it so it's easy to be surrounded by crabs in a bucket who want to bring you down who don't necessarily want to see you win it's pretty rare to all of a sudden surround yourself with influences that want to see you win and want to encourage you and want to be a positive influence it's just been a pretty spectacular networking tool I mean without Twitter I never would have met you guys and it's definitely changed my life for the better

Description:
Are you playing to the algorithmic game on X (formally Twitter)?

In this episode, Nick Huber, shares the methods behind his Twitter growth strategy. 

The posts that are most likely to go viral are those that upset people.

This strategy is a double-edged sword.

It may get you blocked or unfollowed by people online, but as Nick points out, in doing so you might just be weeding out the people who don’t align with you.

YouTuber and entrepreneur Thomas Frank makes a $100,000 a month without even having a real job so how did he create this passive income stream simple by building a community- based product in this video I'm going to teach you the framework used by Thomas Frank Dan Co and Colin and Samir to create a really lucrative business online the best part it's free to start doesn't require any venture capital investment and you can do it from your own bedroom or the beach let's get to it the old way of doing business was by buying attention you take out TV ads Billboards buy banner ads see once you had attention then you could sell people product so marketers would buy attention capture a lead usually in the form of an email and then warm up the lead over time to finally make that sale that's called the lead magnet and I don't believe in the traditional lead magnet anymore because it's evolved into something different the new way of earning business is done by what I call the AC ACP funnel it stands for audience community and product so let's break down how you can use the ACP funnel to build a thriving business step one audience how has Thomas Frank built such a great audience Thomas Frank was always a productivity nerd always after the newest productivity apps and he started youtubing just a few years ago he mastered the art of compelling storytelling and he started by creating content that resonated with him with the hopes that it would resonate with others but most importantly his content wasn't everything to everyone he only talked about productivity apps like notion and what are the best ways to use it all of a sudden Thomas began attracting a loyal fan base the key was delivering consistent videos super high quality for the productivity obsessed viewers appreciated his genuine approach his well researched content and his ability to connect with them on a personal level so here's the lesson you want to be earning attention going deep not wide on your topic creating a space for conversation and creating a community magnet not a lead magnet step two community community is in our blood we've evolved from being Hunters gatherers to modern-day social beings the community is a place where people can come in chat with like-minded people Express themselves and get to know who they really are the outcome is key whether it's becoming a devout Buddhist or an intermittent faster or buying your first luxury watch communities that have a clear goal are the ones that outperform every single time one of the strategies that Thomas just killed it at was consistently engaging in the comment section Thomas makes his broadcast on YouTube a two-way street not a one-way Street he's always asking for comments and dialogue and that's exactly how you convert an audience into a community simply put if you don't engage with your viewers there's no way you're getting a community Thomas took the time to respond to comments answer questions address concerns and that created that two-way conversation best part is he gained valuable insights into what his audience wanted by just engaging with the comments he knew what content and products to build based on the two-way conversations he was able to create a Content flywheel from this the result is Thomas's YouTube subscriber just surpassed 2 million this level of Engagement not only made his audience feel valued but built a ton of trust here's how I think about it Thomas turned a hotel into an apartment a hotel is transactional you go you check in you sleep you wake up you leave you're not baking an apple pie and giving it to your next door neighbor but what you really want is to actually change your hotel into an apartment building an apartment building is more of a community of people that know and trust each other when trust is there that's what makes a business Rock Solid when the economy is doing well or not well you don't have to worry worry there's deep deep trust step three the product once you're able to build an audience and Foster a community your business is built on the product that you're going to offer the question to ask is how do I build a product that's going to be a routine that people are going to use and that's going to supercharge my community why routine well routine is key and that means people are going to come back to this product daily or weekly think about Instagram or Netflix you're going there pretty frequently and the key word is supercharge your community because you want to add not subtract to the experience for them there are two things that enable Thomas to build a really awesome product one like we spoke about he listened to feedback and he implemented his feedback into building a product that people wanted I'll give you an example in the comment section Thomas's audience often puts the problems that they face using a platform like notion so then Thomas just goes around and builds notion templates that solve these problems number two Thomas has consistently been building trust with his audience by giving tutorials and how to guides and he's been doing it for free Mega trust there when you build a community- based product you don't need to buy ads and rent time to sell because you've build up so much trust in your community Toby the founder of Shopify calls this the trust battery you're either constantly charging or losing your charge with your community for example if you're consistently giving free amazing content that they love well your trust battery is going way up but if you're not listening to them or you're selling them way too many products that trust is going to go way down and Thomas Frank understands this like no one else so there you have it folks that's the ACP funnel with how to build a thriving business with zero ads build the audience design a community for that audience and give your community the product to achieve their goal if you follow these steps you'll have a business that will blow your mind I hope you like this video I'll only know if you like this video If you subscribe to my YouTube Channel right now that's the only way I'll know and if you want more Hands-On learning about

https://www.youtube.com/@GregIsenberg

In the age of social media and digital content, attention has become the currency of creativity.

Many creators strive to amass large followings, hoping that the attention they garner will magically translate into financial success. 

But, the reality is different…

Attention alone doesn't pay the bills.

There are different methods to build attention online, and they can’t all be monetized.

attention doesn't pay the bills I also think that a lot of creators have it backwards like it's not you build attention and then you build a business because if you build a ton of attention posting memes and then you try and go launch a business like people aren't brain dead it's not like just because they followed you they're just gonna miraculously buy the thing that you sell and so it's not audience and then oh now I have something to sell it's like who's the person that you want to help build the thing that you know helps them and then go sell the mixtapes out of your car then go get attention for it

how I will think about buying businesses when will be the same way that I'm thinking about starting them which is turning my cost centers like looking at my profit and loss statement and looking at where I'm spending money and the interesting part is like if you look at the 10 businesses that I've started eight of them were businesses that I was spending money on it at bolt storage SEO link building Performance Marketing website development recruiting all these things things that I needed as a business owner and it turns out that if I need them as a business owner then a lot of the business owners who follow me on Twitter for the management advice and trust me because they listen to my words they read my newsletter they listen my podcast whatever it might be they'll need the same type of kind of things that I need sweaty startup Nick Huber the man who needs no introduction Greg what's up man you need no introduction because you are a staple of the internet you've upset enough people on the internet that the people that hate you hate you but the people that love you love you I think in order to get people to really be a fan you have to you have to take a stance on something right if you're just middle down the road everybody thinks you're decent and nobody really likes you that much it's kind of a tough I think that's a tough position to be in if you're gonna you gotta pick a side online I think right well you do have to pick a side if you want to say something worthwhile and interesting but you on the other hand seem like you're you know how to rile up the crowds is that fair to say I think the one of the most fascinating phenomenons to me is that a human being could be going about their day doing whatever they want they're living their life most of them are in America where you can literally do whatever you want to be doing you're either with people you chose to be around you're in a place that you chose to move into you're working a job that you took a job offer to do and you're gonna open up Twitter and you're going to see something that some stranger named Nick Huber put on the internet and you're gonna get upset by that upset to the point where you're gonna take time out of your day to just spew out a bunch of mean things or or tell your friends or talk about it or just have these negative thoughts floating around your head totally mind-blowing to me I didn't know that such a large percentage of people were that easily influenced by things that just don't matter at all and are not in their control well I think it's not it's not that it's Nick Huber saying it it's just that people have strongly held beliefs and then when you say something that's against that belief that really upsets people I think it covers it goes back to like human beings are tribal and it feels like a very much it feels like you're attacking them even though you're kind you're always like joking about it for example like they you know tell people about the deck tweet I made a tweet that said I found this stupid picture of a contractor who put a deck on half of a slide glass door on a second level so that literally half the slide glass door the window part of it was facing outside straight to the ground but on the other half there was a deck where one one 200 pound person would take up the whole deck I would get out there and nobody could stand there with me on that deck and I made a tweet that said hey just uh installed this at one of my rental properties the tenant moved out of course I raised the rent you know from from 900 to 1500 the tenant moved out of course but I was able to release it at the new higher price right away like this is the key to Value creation and and wealth building or something stupid and I and also just a lot of people hate landlords man they think that a lot of people think that how residential real estate should be and entitlement and not a for-profit business and you know so so that one really really took off and took off like how many people saw it uh the HOA one got 50 million people saw it this one got maybe 20 20 million people saw it so yeah we're talking we're talking I don't know a third of a third of the daily active users on Twitter probably saw that tweet at some point or the other crazy and what does that translate into dollars and business like why why do a tweet like that you know are you doing it for fun or are you actually like oh you know this actually this will get my name out there it'll translate into dollars so there is something to be said for the fact that the Tweet after if you add value if you teach somebody something it will be seen by more people because if you're scrolling down through Twitter and you avoid and you see a Nick Uber post but you just continue to scroll on Elon is a lot less likely to show you the next Nick Huber tweet for sure like hey you just saw one of these you didn't click on it so we're not going to show you but if you go through and you click on somebody's tweet you're going to see more of that person it happens all the time so even my true followers the people who are into business the people I'm after they'll click on the deck tweet just to read the replies because the replies are hilarious so the next tweet then if I add a lot of value or if I pitch something or something or the other it'll get it'll get seen by more people there's kind of an afterburn of Engagement but that's not truly why or how I end up doing I just have a weird sense of humor and I think it's funny to get people going but yeah there's no there's no like massive follower gain if anything I'll lose a couple followers on a day that that'll happen it's not a big of an engagement hack as people think it is and now unfortunately on Twitter you have a ton of people trying to do it and they kind of just maybe that's what I look like too but they kind of look like idiots when they don't do it right so we have a friend Julian Shapiro he tweets like once a quarter now I wonder why and well I think a big part of it is he feels you know I want to speak for him but you know you just yeah you understand what you think you can just say what you think he might be after yeah you know Julian really thinks about how do I like the reason why he got Twitter is because he he was like there's a bunch of really smart people on Twitter and I want those people to read my tweets [Music] yeah yeah it's the same reason why we all got on um and not even to read my tweets but also that I can go and reach out to these really smart people send them a DM and be like hey do you want to grab coffee or whatever it's a network accelerant Network accelerate now when you're creating tweets that upset a lot of people you might get blocked and some of those people that might block you are the people that you set out to um those are the people that you set out to attract initially so I think a Julian will use Twitter very differently today than he would a few years ago because he's like I'm only when I drop something on Twitter it is going to be fire like it is going to be super well researched it's going to be like nothing else out there it's going to be a unicorn you're gonna love it and he doesn't want to play those games algorithmic games whereas it feels like what you are playing a little bit of algorithmic games when you're tweeting I should I should absolutely be more disciplined on Twitter Absolutely I'll say that like there is not a method to this madness all the time I half the tweets are doing nothing to for Nick Huber brand there's nothing to gain by making a lot of these tweets that's for sure but like I don't understand how you can build a couple hundred thousand follower list and have that distribution and have the ability to get in those people's minds and only tweet or go weeks or months without tweeting that's just like um somebody somebody on social media recently like put the like the ignorance tax I talked about the ignorance tax and like if you make a million dollars a year there's a a four million dollar ignorance tax of you not knowing how to make five million dollars a year like that gap between what you earn now and your earning potential is the ignorance tax and I know that Julian's not a good example because he crushes it at career life entrepreneurship but I feel like there's always something that is worthy of free eyeballs all over the internet but like the people who block me I think that's that's also kind of there's an advantage there like I'm weeding out the people who don't get my sense of humor for one thing take it too personally politically totally disagree with me and people that I wouldn't maybe drive with over time anyway I'm kind of weeding those folks out so I don't mind I don't mind having a couple of true fans and a lot of people who just okay Nick's not for me and that's perfectly fine it's perfectly fine and the truth is even if you're not saying anything controversial like I don't consider my tweets to be controversial but people block me all the time so this morning A buddy of mine sent me a tweet and and so I go and click on the tweet and I see I can't see it that's the best and I and and I'm like who's this guy Tom and he because I can't see it I had to check it out in incognito mode he's like it's Tom Sweeney and I was like who's Tom Sweeney he goes he's the CEO of epic games it's like a 20 plus billion dollar company and all of a sudden I'm like why did Tom Sweeney block me on Twitter like what did I say such that Tom Sweeney a guy I've never met with a I've never met with him before B I've never replied or liked any of his tweets and and also he's you know epic games up until very recently was a client of late checkout as well so you know he probably doesn't know that but it's you know and it was a great experience so it's like don't go on Twitter unless you're you're you're prepared to have some of your Heroes block you it's yeah that's the part that hurts about Twitter like I can take I can take you know the Twitter handle at Mom's basement 42069 I can take them blocking me all day like they're just an anonymous account don't care I can I can take him talking hate sending the meanest meanest things I don't really care but often when you're out and you're in the arena You're Building you're tweeting whatever it is just being yourself you're going to have respected people in the community people that you know people who are building businesses people are doing amazing things and who also are respected by a lot of your peers you're going to have them jump on and say mean things or block you or do whatever that is when it hurts you're absolutely right if there's one thing I've learned about Twitter it's that the bigger you get the more unavoidable it is especially if you be yourself and you're not worried about what people think online you're gonna piss people off it's part of it and I could do a better job of not pissing off so many people absolutely probably will eventually just not waste time doing that but it's a have it's a habit I can't help it so I want to shift gears a little bit and talk more about the Nick Huber world so because it isn't just at sweaty startup on Twitter anymore there's a bunch of accounts that you're a part of and businesses that you've created on top of it I've talked a lot about recently about multi-preneurship which is this idea around you know how do you create a company that creates companies and that's something that you're doing and doing really well could you just talk a little bit about your world of Entrepreneurship yeah I think a pretty influential moment I guess we have to back up is you you send it you send a text to the group chat today that we've been interacting for three years and it kind of blew my mind that hey me and Greg Eisenberg met each other three years ago and we started hanging out with six other guys who are similarly driven similar you know similar growth strategies all supporting each other and you know that was kind of a pivotal moment where I began to really accelerate my growth on Twitter and then I woke up a year later and realized and you know a lot of this was at your you know poking and encouragement that we're sitting on a pretty tremendous opportunity here so I can play golf mess around focus on real estate tweet piss off the woke mob do whatever I want to do or I can get out there and work my butt off to capitalize on what could eventually be a fleeting opportunity one that's not around forever which is distribution like the ability to tweet and get in the first 10 minutes get inside of 10 000 people's heads and in the first three hours reach more people than can fit in the largest athletic stadiums in the world that is a competitive Advantage if you want to sell things or start companies or attract Talent or it's just the power of distribution is is unbelievable so I got serious about it and it was the you know the support Shepherd experience in 2021 where I took a very minority owner you know affiliate deal at first and then became a minority ownership stake of what grew to be a massive company 25 million dollar plus business now today and that opened my eyes to the power of this stuff it's real these aren't just the people that follow me are not just you know Anonymous accounts sitting in their parents basement playing video games these people are in the real world doing Real Deals building real businesses adding a lot of value and I have a direct line into their mind and how can I capitalize on that how could you know it's it's build companies that I need and that these people need so just like you I mean I'm a huge fan of stuff that doesn't scale entrepreneurship everybody talks about scalability everybody talks about raising Capital about moats about you know world-changing ideas I think that if you have a competitive advantage in one area you can do regular things that other people do and make really good money and it can become life-changing money as you've seen with some of the agencies that you've built I think it's it's been really interesting to see our group of friends you me some of our other friends all kind of shift towards repeatable boring not that scalable businesses but that when you play the game at a at a big level and you know how to delegate you know how to Market you know how to sell and you have distribution you can attract Talent you can build teams just amazing things can happen I think you're you and me have been cheering each other on you know since the very beginning of like people are sleeping on agencies people are sleeping on these businesses that don't scale so you and I both are kind of seizing the opportunity yeah and you know we can say who's in the group so it's it's me you sahil bloom champori Sam par Nikita beer Austin and Austin Reef that's it right Julian was a part of the group and he left but it was amicable so it's interesting because a lot of that group is traditionally been like a venture-backed type mentality like I raise Venture Capital Sam raised money for his you know for the hustle uh Sean has raised Venture um Austin raised Venture you know uh saho was in a pea fund and it's interesting that we've all kind of just had a collective aha moment which was distribution matters to your point I love that like direct line into people's brains and just building trust as much as possible on these platforms and and then what's a non-ventor backable business at least a start that you can build you know people call boring businesses people call it not scalable but you know Shepherd is a great example of something that could scale right like that's a business that could be really big yeah it's not that we're not starting businesses that could be really big I think there's examples in all of our in everything that we are doing but from Sam to Austin to you to me to Sean all the businesses that we're going after there's examples of massive companies there's examples of companies that do you know 25 50 100 plus million dollars a year of Revenue so we're not talking we're not necessarily talking like a small one-man solopreneur Journey here we're talking about stuff that's already been done before like this stuff has all been done there's marketing agencies there's pay-per-click agencies there's you know design and you know creative Studio agencies like click checkout this stuff exists but if you do it well you're a good salesperson you're good at building teams magic happens and all of us kind of got that all it hit us all at the same time and we were kind of on a race to do boring [ __ ] make as much money as possible it's been really fun to watch everybody crush it I feel like the majority of people in this group chat now have have and now have like offshoring agencies yeah Austin's got one Sean it's uh yeah I mean there's there's great business models and there's poor business models and we can all tell the difference totally totally so it's yeah it's just been fascinating to see and yeah I wonder what do you think what do you think happens over the next three years for us for the folks in the group yeah because I think and the reason I ask is because I think I mean we were right over the last three years you know and if we're right over the next three years there's probably a lot of lessons that people can learn from from what your prediction might be I think the value of distribution will continue I think the opportunity in basic blocking and tackling businesses will continue I think we as a group will level up and we'll start buying companies we'll start investing in more companies we'll start advising more companies we'll each build kind of our own personalized holding company of like you're saying a multipreneur where we we can we can pull some really valuable levers in multiple companies at the same time and we can have partners that help us execute that help us run these things that allow us to live the life that we want to live while still creating content and doing what we love to do with our friends and family and whoever else but yeah it's it's a I think we're all gonna level up I I think everybody will level up from you know being happy about a you know obviously some of us are playing games at different levels what Nikita can do and and what Austin's doing at morning brew and what Sam's doing at Hampton like those are different levels than me starting a web development agency and being happy with 20 grand a month of cash flow but I think we'll all just continue to level up and I like to think that I'll cross the chasm and be able to take you know maybe buy a company for 5 10 20 million and take it to the next level I don't know how to do that but I want to learn how to do that that's kind of my next challenge I think some of your agencies are already growing really really fast and you'll be able to do spectacular things and I think um the Firepower coming out of that group is going to be pretty awesome because when you have people with a positive mindset and they love to see each other win it's just it's abnormal most of the time when people crush it they're surrounded by people who obviously proximity wise are not all crushing it so it's easy to be surrounded by crabs in a bucket who want to bring you down who don't necessarily want to see you win pretty rare to all of a sudden surround yourself with influences that want to see you win and want to encourage you and want to be a positive influence and um it's just been a pretty spectacular networking tool I mean without Twitter I never would have met you guys and it's definitely changed my life for the better so I want to talk about buying a business for a second so at the end of 2022 we bought a business and out of that business was incubated our fastest growing property right now which is uh boringmarketing.com which started off as an AI technology that we ended up spitting up to help Brands uh with SEO and now I'm hooked on this idea around what else could I buy because not only are you buying the assets but you're really buying a team of operators who have systems and processes um and you can just like on day one lean into it so my question to you is you want to be buying more businesses how do you like what's your framework for thinking about what to buy how to buy it what price to buy it at and yeah as much details as you're willing to share buying a business is exciting to me because there is nothing harder than the first seven or eight months of a service business startup I I own Ari cost seg which is doing 150 Grand a month now and has reach escape velocity and it's going to be an amazing asset it's a life-changing business that you know Mitchell Baldridge myself Dan and Mitchell's wife Mel have started but still at the six month Mark the six month Mark we had a phone call where our operator is near tears we're selling we're selling 50 Grand a week of cost eggs and we can only deliver 10 grand a week of costs eggs we're having massive bottlenecks inside the organization of actually delivering we had overloaded the company with business I we were doing a good job promoting on Twitter and it was exploding but that was really really hard and really really stressful with sleepless nights for me as as a non-operating partner and hell for our operating partner which is Mitchell's wife Mel we got through it she's a badass the company's going well but the idea of buying a company that has got that part covered that is extremely intriguing to me so how I thought about how I will think about buying businesses when will be the same way that I'm thinking about starting them which is turning my my cost centers like looking at my profit and loss statement and looking at where I'm spending money and the interesting part is like if you look at the 10 businesses that I've started eight of them were businesses that I was spending money on it at bolt storage Property and Casualty Insurance debt brokerage property costs eggs SEO link building Performance Marketing website development recruiting all these things were things that I needed as a business owner and it turns out that if I need them as a business owner then a lot of the business owners who follow me on Twitter for the management advice and trust me because they listen to my words they read my newsletter they listen to my podcast whatever it might be they'll need the same type of kind of things that I need so it's just a it's a comfort thing and I also needed the personal cash flow like the personal cash flow is new to me like having liquidity having money in the bank is new a way to you know risk it all in my opinion was to buy a business that was too big and the turnaround fails and all of a sudden I'm personally guaranteed the people that I raise money from are pissed I've ruined a reputation so I'm just now getting to the point where my personal monthly cash flow is starting to stack up enough where I can make take some swings but I also I'm kind of thinking about my you know Nick Huber holding company as a as an accumulation of talent I'm trying to get talented operators in I'm trying to get to know them get to know their strengths get to know what they're good at how good are they building teams how good are they you know sales how good how good they are they at doing these things inside these companies and over the course of a year two years three years while we're collecting money while we're building the bankroll I'm building this Rolodex of operators that I can you know okay maybe web run didn't work but I know that will at web run is one of the best you know team Builders and on the agency side that I know so I'm gonna go with will I'm gonna buy a company maybe um you know bold SEO is thriving and we can pull out we can pull Reagan out of that business because you know we can replace them we can hire the systems are built and me and Reagan I can install Reagan in another company and buy a business that's kind of how I'm thinking about okay right now I'm laying the groundwork I'm laying the groundwork of businesses that all companies need every company needs a link building service every company needs paid ad support every company needs a really good website every company needs you know employees and a lot in Latin America in the Philippines and be able to recruit U.S Talent every company needs these things my companies that I buy in the future will need these things and I can use my Foundation of companies to accelerate you know the cash flow allows me to buy them the services allow me to accelerate them and I can own and hold them and either sell them or just continue to build my network of like my five-year goal is to build my Rolodex full of badass operators that I know and trust they've come in they've showed me what they can do and I think that's kind of the underrated part of me starting these companies yes I talked to Andrew Wilkinson on the phone a couple days ago and he's like Nick what are you doing man you're starting all these companies you got to just go buy them you're you're playing the game on hard mode and obviously that was just you know he he critiqued he he nuanced that with a lot of other things and he he supports it generally not trying to make it sound otherwise but he basically said you know your ability to go buy these companies gonna be dependent on who and how you can hire the operating the the the management teams so I think that you know me building this Foundation of companies will set me up to then feel comfortable moving and you know utilizing the team that I'm building now to kind of help accelerate it all I was actually sitting in this seat in 2020 when I spoke to Andrew Wilkinson when I was just starting late checkout and he gave me basically the same advice Greg I don't understand why you're starting so many companies why are you building so many products just go and buy them and my reaction to to Andrew was yeah but it's so much fun going zero to one and building from scratch like I love coming up with the name coming up with the brand do the positioning like the zero to one and while I'll I'll always love that he was right like it took me a few years to realize you know what like okay you know if going zero to one is Art going one to n is more science and playing only in zero to one is a bit of a mistake when you're you can there's no reason why you or I can't be doing both like we can we can still be incubating and buying it's a I just think it's just such a a Testament to the fact that business is about momentum like businesses and evolution it's it's a it's a process that you if you if you try to start on third base if you try to start by just buying a big company and turning it around when you've never operated a small company you've never started a company you've never built teams you've you don't have a ton of experience delegating it's really hard but I I'm looking forward to these new challenges and Andrew is absolutely right you and I are both seeing the light that you can buy companies and you can pull a couple levers and create millions of dollars out of thin air of equity value and cash flow that's that's exciting I think you and I are both going to love that we're gonna love it you're already proving that you can do it I'm excited to challenge myself and try to do it but I'm not there yet I'm getting close getting more and more comfortable every day how do you think about what is the right size in terms of purchase price for the first deal I would buy a company now that has two or three hundred grand of op of ebitda I mean that's enough that's enough to you know hire some decent people to pull some levers you know they got a management team you know they have some people who can well they actually they don't have a management team at two or three hundred grand the owner is the manager but they have some people who can execute they have some client leads they have some people who can deliver what whatever the services they're delivering I think that's a beautiful place to start because it can be really low risk you can get a business really cheap and seller finance almost all of it and if it burnt crashes and burns then you hand the keys back and and walk away it gets tougher for the first one especially if you go out and need to you know take an SBA loan for hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars and and you got to raise money for the equity and it it's not rocket science and I think that people can do it absolutely can be done especially if you know how to delegate and build teams but it just seems riskier to me but it came down to hey do I want to buy a business that does two or three hundred grand a year or do I want to just do the work in six months and get my own business there and save the four six seven hundred thousand dollars I'd have to buy that company for well it's it's also the Assumption you're making there is that a hundred percent of your bets are gonna make it there but they're bets right like we incubate stuff all the time that fails so like we'll often put 250 Grand into something and try it and it fails and I'm much now one of the things I'm learning is like all these starts and stops that you're doing 250 Grand here 150 Grand here 100 Grand here 300 Grand here I I'm kind of seeing the light where I'm like actually I want to do less incubation like reduce that budget still do incubation but reduce that budget and take that budget to actually just buy something that's working mm-hmm I got a question for you Greg you know me really well now um yeah we are we are friends you we've been talking weekly almost daily for three years now you you've seen how I've evolved you're getting you you read my tweets you you follow along closely what could I be missing like what what do you if and and pretend we're not recording like be candid I I like constructive feedback I'm I'm uh I love it I Revel in it and I'm not easily offended like what do you think I'm doing wrong or what do you think I could do better or what what blind spots do you think that I could have or what do you think five years from now I'll look back and say damn I wish I knew that and I would have started doing that earlier now because I feel like you you are five years further ahead than me so or you just could spot some things that I could be missing so I think that you could be acquiring one to two companies per year and I think that if you you know in five years from now if you're acquiring one to two per year you have eight companies after five years I think two of them could be smashing successes way bigger than anything you've incubated I think that you're you're a finance guy at the core like you said seller financing assuming that everyone is listening to this understands what that means like you understand your way around the books so I think that because you understand distribution and the books and Deals like to me it makes like total sense that you should be buying companies I think that if I were you I would one thing I would do is I wouldn't buy a 200 300 000 ebitda business I would go and just say you know how much is it to cut you know to go to an MBA school cost I don't know 50 Grand a year so I'm gonna take a budget my MBA budget it's gonna be 50 grand and I'm gonna buy something for 50 Grand I'm going to do the negotiation myself I'm gonna I'm just gonna manage the whole process from A to Z and I'm going to put an operator on it and you do that like assuming this fifty thousand dollar investment goes to nothing but with just a way for you to test and hit the tires on this you know put it into uh your audience see if they like it and I would also probably not do a service based business because I would also want to test what are other types of businesses that my audience would like so I tweeted at you a couple days ago um I forget what you tweeted but I was basically like you should be Inky oh yeah you were tweeting about jobber and a few other SAS products and I always see you tweeting about these different SAS products and I'm kind of like well why don't you own one of these SAS products like you you talk about how you know you're building businesses for you but you're probably spending hundreds thousands of dollars a month on these SAS products that you could be owning and actually per like building for you and as you know the multiples on SAS businesses are a lot higher than the multiples on service businesses so if I were you the number one thing I'd be doing is buying a cheap SAS product giving it to my audience iterating from there and like writing my learnings after three or six months and then say okay I did it for 50k now let me try to buy something with 300 to 500 000 in ebitda that's good advice yeah I need I need some SAS products I need them I I know that I know it's on my roadmap I just need to take it more seriously I think you're right yeah and I said it because like we're constantly incubating SAS products and the the other thing that people don't talk about in sasoland that much is that like you can you can literally incubate a SAS product in 30 days you know I'm old enough to remember like you know five years ago when it cost you wanted any SAS product it was two million dollars it cost two million dollars to build a SAS product that was like pre-product Market fit that's just like a product and now it doesn't cost two million dollars anymore if I how much would it cost me to build a Google review aggregator because I need Google reviews on every single one of my companies and 63 self storage facility you know brick and mortar locations I need a way to Aggregate and automate getting Google reviews from customers and so does my entire audience so should I build that or should I find somebody who had tried to build it and couldn't get any customers and wants to sell it to me for you know under 100 Grand I mean I would start with finding out to see if that exists somewhere else one of the ways I typically do that is I go on product hunt and product hunt has like I see a fail failed product so 99 of the products that are on product times have failed and you might find something you know from 2015 or 2017 that actually looked really good it's basically a dormant business uh operator might have just lost interest in it or you know a lot of people lose interest in these businesses because they're just not seeing traction so if you can come to them and be like hey I'm your attraction guy you're the product person like help help me revive this I'll give you fifty thousand dollars to do it and I'm gonna give you upside I think it's compelling that's a good idea I'll be on product hunt the rest of the day I also think that you could you know you could part you can also partner with other people right like you can partner with a firm like ours where like we've done deals where we'll just take upside and sometimes a little bit cash a little upside and partner with people um you know we've partnered with uh you know Mr Beast has night media and they've built some some products um and we've partnered and took equity in some of those so I also think there's groups like ours like for people listening to this that like are interested but might not you know want to put out a lot of money like there's like cold call different agencies and partners and even if on their website it says they're not they don't do this stuff like you never know it's the same thing with hiring a potential employee right someone might have a job but if you DM them or you send them a message who knows you might catch them on a day where they're having a bad day and they really like what you're doing and all of a sudden you're able to convince them to come join your team yeah I like it I like it the world is swimming with opportunity that's for sure it's almost like you can't you can't keep your head above water it's coming so fast sometimes do you ever feel like you're doing too many projects at the same time because every time I start a project the analogy I use is it cuts my brain in another section so if you think about it as like a pizza it's just like you're cutting you know you're cutting it in another slice and another slice and another slice and another slice and it's a bit of mental overload so sometimes you know I look at what you're doing and I'm like whoa this guy's like working on a lot of projects um is that just me or how do you feel about it yeah I I'm over delegator to the extreme meaning I'm not going to interact with any of the customers I'm not going to have an email address from for the company I'm not gonna have a job in the company or I'm pissed off and that's a blessing and a curse it's a curse because you know it's 80 as good as it would be if I were doing it myself like I could do it myself better but it's a blessing because I can take more shots and I can invest in an operator who I know is awesome I mean an example is my Property and Casualty Insurance company which could be the biggest of all my businesses in 10 years I have my my the CEO of that company is is my business partner Dan Hagberg who I went to college with and founded the storage company with and owns half my real estate portfolio and I know he's a killer I have not been on one meeting I have not done anything at all for that company except ask him on the fourth hole of a golf course oh hey by the way how's how's Titan risk going other companies are different like not ever not all operators are as Compton as Dan but in a way like they're they're impressing me like these people that own these that are running these companies they're impressing me like I don't I don't need to talk to the guy who runs my recruiting company but once a month and he we've done seventy six thousand dollars of Revenue and in the first three months and recruiting cycle is like long a recruiting sales cycles Long so I don't know I think I will pull the plug on some but none of them right now are like damn this is the one I probably am going to need to pull the plug on yeah it's it's not I I I like it I like being able to check in I like looking at the new leads and all the companies I like it's kind of Addicting to kind of look at the the trajectory and the tough part but yeah then they're stressful then they're stressful parts of course it's like one of these companies did some work for my company and it didn't go well and and Dan's like hey Nick I need to give you some feedback uh this this was [ __ ] shitty like we're gonna fire your company here if they don't get their stuff together I'm like oh damn it that's stressful so yeah it's not all without it's not all without its stress that's for sure but I still spend 10 hours a week on the golf course and 10 hours a week working on my personal brand and I hang on my family a lot you know so I feel like I have a decent balance but I'm definitely I'm definitely working hard right now that's for sure I like the rule of I don't have an email address because it's it it creates this distance between you and and the business and it's basically and I think Andrew does this really well Andrew Wilkinson which I think he got from Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett which is it's all about the operator and we respect and support the operator and we're here to help but we're not really here to be in the day-to-day like if you're if we're if I'm here in the day-to-day then there's an issue with the operating team yeah and I think I'll maybe I'll pull the plug and shut down a company maybe I'll fire an operator and have to bring in another one if I still think the company's a good a fundamentally good business the operator is just not doing a good job that's all still to be determined but yeah like these people that I'm embedding on are going to be the ones that make or break this stuff and I think they like that they like the fact that they control the company they control their Destiny they ping me with any more customers um and it's kind of like like you said taking taking small bets and some of them will some of them will turn into big things and they're varying level of Investments too like the Property and Casualty Insurance is a cash a money suck right now I'm I'm personally investing 30 grand a month into that one the business brokerage is another 30 grand a month and I'm just I'm investing because I believe in those companies but just a longer sales cycle and permitting and requirements and you know getting paid on a deal closing when you start a business brokerage you know best case scenario is six to nine months after you start the business so definitely varying levels of personal investment can you talk more about the flywheels that you're creating for these individual businesses because I'd imagine you don't want to be in a situation where these businesses are reliant on you for leads and customers and I've noticed you have big Twitter accounts for your for Shepard or for Titan risk or for bold SEO so can you talk more about how you're thinking about that yeah and right now I'm doing a lot of the work like I'll be honest I I'm doing a lot of the tweeting I'm controlling a lot of the accounts I'm I'm I'm doing a lot of the marketing myself but I hired a badass copywriter from teamgaryvee that started three months ago and he's working his way up getting more and more trust every single day I think he's a keeper and he's going to be with me a long time and he's going to become a very wealthy man and have a pretty important job at my holding company also have a systems operator guy who's you know working with me to empower all the operators and all the companies he doesn't work for any one business he is his job is a similar to mine if give the operators exactly what they need to win and then get the hell out of the way I have uh another copywriter that started last week and I have a video editor and another podcast video editor so the team at the holding company level is kind of the goal of there is to build a machine that can take more of the content creation off my plate more repurposing content that I wrote reposting content that I already wrote clipping these videos that we're making right now clipping it into you know stuff for Twitter linked you know link LinkedIn uh Instagram so on but yeah it's a it's it turns out that a lot of these companies are the same like a lot of these all these companies need a deal account to pay their employees they need to get in with Shepard to hire some people they need to get in with recruit jet to hire you know the middle management folks they need to get in uh Gusto they need an air table they need a slack Channel they need email systems all set up and finalized they need a good website with forms and and you know we need to collect our you know organize our sales funnel the same way so every subsequent company that we start is a really a quicker process to get started like I'm going to find a premium domain I'm going to buy a premium domain for 10 grand or less and three days later there's going to be a site that we can we can collect customers in and that during that time I'm working a deal with an operator as soon as we get it signed we're going out you know and hiring the first bit of talent and a month after we have the idea to start a business a month later we have five people on the team and we're we're you know pursuing sales with clients like we can we can do it really really fast now we're getting better at it so and then there's there's the interconnectivity of them working together like them becoming custom customers of each other and referring business all around and sharing referral fees like a client comes to web run and they need link Building Services then they send them over to bold SEO and they get a 15 Revenue share and bold SEO finds a customer customer that needs a lot of web work and they send them to web run maybe they need paid ads and they go to ad Rhino it's just it's a it's a it's a big you know flywheel of just tools for businesses and my businesses too which is pretty awesome what about email email newsletters as a form of you know nurturing leads you know you have a really big newsletter that I subscribe to I love it um you send weekly emails and in the emails you know you you highlight some of your companies are you thinking about having individual newsletters for your companies and is that a big part of the strategy no we we've thought about it I've had operators bring it up that they want to start writing a newsletter and I just can't see the value of building a whole nother audience and being responsible for a whole other newsletter when I can you know get yesterday's or Monday's email I highlighted bold SEO in the top of email we got 24 leads 24 leads our sales team our sales guys booked up for the whole week like his whole week schedule he's got six calls a day now so yeah it's it's my newsletter is the core strategy like Twitter's awesome the individual Twitter accounts are awesome we can you know reach our customers pretty well on Twitter but email is where I can really really Drive value I don't do any outside advertising online newsletter I don't let anybody pay for spots on my newsletter I take up all my own space really inside of these companies now and it's so far it's working pretty well some some services are harder to sell than others but some of them just a lot of business owners need which is which is a blessing your newsletter is on convertkit yep love convertkit you and yeah right so right now I'm thinking I'm thinking about switching from sub stack to convertkit can you sell me on why I should on move from sub stack to convertkit uh convertkit is really good link tracking I can change the links after I send emails out um I can you know stack sequences on so I know that if somebody clicks on The Bold SEO link I can then drip them three more emails over the next week about SEO Services because I know they're a pretty warm lead even though they didn't fill out the form on Bold seo.com so yeah it's it's just the customizability if you're if you're gonna start promoting and selling on your newsletter it's really good for that I don't even utilize it fully but then there's the Creator network of like everybody being able to recommend each other that you know the quality of the emails aside and I know that you know three out of four might be a total joke you were you were bringing up some stuff this week about how like it could it could be getting just a lot of confusion among people not even knowing that signing up for my email list but that's still been I've still noticed like a uptick in like the the sales which are important to me and at two or three bucks a an email it's it's worth that so yeah it's it's all convertkit just does a good job but beehive sub stack they're all they're all doing similar stuff now too so yeah the Beehive we use beehive for you probably need a robot which are our AI newsletter and it's really amazing for for just like you want to get a message out there and you want to push it out in a really beautiful way and I love at the end of each beehive newsletter you can say like do you like it did you not like it and there's almost like a comment section so you really really get to understand like you unders you get to understand how valuable the email was to someone and that's my favorite part about beehive but if you're actually trying to sell stuff convertkit with the automations I.E like what you're saying you click this therefore I'm going to put you in this drip fomo sequence of you know teaching people about SEO for example before they buy it right there's so many people who might click on your SEO link or your re Cossack link and just not be ready to buy uh so they're in this phase and it's like how do you nurture them and build trust during that that time so that uh you know maybe after the five email sequence they're they're ready to make the jump and what's the what's the lead magnet what's the lead magnet set up so the most valuable part for me I haven't even really utilized like my marketing team we have a plan to really utilize these sequences to like you're saying nurture these leads I don't do it well yet what's the like lead magnets are like the best way that I can get high value people on my newsletter like hey yes here's a PDF here's a PDF it's free all you gotta do is give me your email here's some awesome copy on Twitter why you should click the link and why you should get it I wish I could share my screen and just show you like all my I can track all my pages all my lead magnets I can see how many people visited the page how many people signed up through that lead magnet it tagged them so I know which of my subscribers came from like a really high value real estate like somebody who signs up through like hey here's the here's the 20 aspects of closing a real estate deal I know that the 450 people who signed up through that lead magnet like they're in the real estate game they're valuable those followers are worth 20 bucks a pop or more but I know that the people who clicked on like oh here's a list to 200 plus business ideas I know that they're all entrepreneurs and that's fine too but I have all that like separated inside of convertkit and I can post these I can post these lead magnets on a schedule over and over and over again and I can track I can track how many people are signing up on each one which ones are hitting how they're hitting the different copy changes and stuff like that so what's your question or is that the yeah the sub stack the sub stack have like magnitude ability where you can like no not even close like not even close sub stack is the fastest way to get up and running if you wanna create a newsletter so when I'm doing anything and like if I'm trying to post on Tick Tock if I'm trying to and they don't post on Tick Tock if I'm trying to post on Instagram and I don't post on Instagram if I'm trying to buy a business and I'm not and I've never bought a business I always ask myself what is the path of least resistance so that I can see if I like this thing so I chose substack you know three four years ago because it was so easy to do it got set up in 30 seconds now after you know I think it's important for people to in whatever it is they're doing to quarterly or yearly ask themselves like what is change between now and then and for me personally what has changed is I now have 70 plus thousand subscribers and I'm also selling some of my services within my email newsletter and my open rate has is starting to really go up and my clip through it click-through rate is going up so I'm starting to really build trust with people and subseac just doesn't give me the tools I need you know convertkit is really interesting because it feels almost like like the tagline for convertkit should be take email seriously like if if if convertkit hired they check out our design and branding agency we would probably do something around that and we would try to own the category of oh yeah you're about to share your screen okay here we go go for it okay so these are my new signups per day um where they're coming from Creator network is is the vast majority but you know bio links and five ways to get better at sales these are different these are all different landing pages that I have like three ways to force appreciation on a real estate asset those 26 subscribers very high value 20 tools to start a new business with the 20 tools like the tech stack I use to start my company that's just a free pdf that people get you know 2 200 people I posted this one time on Twitter 2000 people saw and I added a thousand subscribers that I know are business operators like that's that's phenomenally value valuable businesses that I love um you know these are super you know this one right here businesses that I love on Twitter I posted this on Twitter maybe four times it's like hey I spent five years building a list of 200 plus business ideas here's how um you know download this list of 200 plus business ideas and it's just a PDF with a list of all these different businesses twenty thousand people have visited that landing page 8 000 subscribers have signed up for my newsletter through that one lead magnet which is uh just pretty awesome and I can build I can build out this full list of lead magnets this is this is dope like this is taking email seriously yeah and so and yeah and then you got the actual broadcast where you build out the build out the content I got the drafts in here that aren't sent out yet but you know yeah these links can trigger these links can trigger sequences and you can set set up all that up here to where like if somebody clicks this link it tags that subscriber and sends them follow-up emails at certain different times so it's pretty good yeah yeah I mean my dream to be honest is a mix of beehives design and like polls with convertkits serious automations like that's my wonder when I wonder yeah it was amazing to watch convertkit just take over drip like drip used to be the one like three years ago drip was the only one people used and it's just been a slow move to convertkit but I wonder when Nathan is going to add you know the the design forward front end to convert it it would be easy to do those polls and I mean I hit him up I hit him up the other day and I was like dude high or late checkout we'll crush it for you so maybe soon I'll tell them to hire I'll text him right now it's time to higher late check out I gotta run but dude thank you for letting me and everyone take a peek inside your multi-preneur brain uh I think I think the world of you and you're doing incredible stuff and I can't wait to see what you build over the next three years and buy I appreciate it man you're uh you're a pretty serious influence in my life and I look up to you a lot and I I appreciate the the fact that you want to see me win man and I I want to see you win and I know you're I know you're crushing it so appreciate you having me on and thanks for everything also I'm driving from Montreal to Miami which is a long drive but maybe I'll I'll stop uh in your your uh neck of the woods on my way let's do

I don't think anyone should start a podcast if you don't enjoy a podcast for the first year podcast made no money yes I might have had listeners but like it was still a huge amount of work and the return was doing the podcast so I wouldn't advise anyone to start a podcast as like a business opportunity unless you have an audience so if you don't have an audience start it because you love it even with a tiny podcast I've met a ton of people who've been able to use it as a way to ask for a conversation with someone that otherwise they wouldn't be able to

Title: Reasons NOT To Start a Podcast, With Chris Hutchins
Published: 2023-08-15 14:00:19 UTC
Description:
A podcast is one the most difficult platforms to grow an audience on.

Why?

There is no built in growth mechanism

Unlike other social platforms, there’s no way for your audience to easily find and share your podcast content with their friends.

It’s much easier to grow an audience first, and create a podcast second.

podcast is a very terrible platform to launch if you have no audience the thing about podcasting that is worse than basically almost every other platform is that there is no built-in growth mechanism no built-in easy sharing mechanism on a podcast you have to like take your phone out of your pocket then you have to like go back to the episode page and then go back to the show page and then hit the share button and then click like the text message button and then type your friend's email text in feels very invasive if you just post a video on YouTube and it seeds it out to 100 people and they love it then it's because the seed it to more and more and more people and that happens on lots of social platforms

“It's early enough in podcasting that there's room for more podcasts. It's late enough that you can't just be a success because you have one.” - Chris Hutchins

Creating a podcast is one thing, but creating a remarkable podcast is an entirely different story.

If you want to start a podcast, you have to first determine what makes your podcast different to all the others that are already out there

you could have a different podcast and still suck at podcast honestly I think the most important thing is to find some way to determine if you actually have like good content you could spend all the time in the world growing a podcast but people aren't going to stick around it's going to be so much harder so first off can you actually explain why your podcast is different to other people try that try to see if you can convince people about why your podcast is different it's early enough in podcasting that there's room for more podcasts it's late enough that you can't just like be a success because you have one

Title: The Easiest Way To Make Money As A Writer, Explains Nicolas Cole

https://www.youtube.com/@GregIsenberg

“If you want to make money as a writer, it's significantly easier to start with the end.”

Nicolas Cole, one of the world’s top ghostwriters, share’s how he built a 7-figure writing business.

Rather than staring at a blank page, or wondering what your writing should be about, focus one one thing first: “What problem can I solve?”

Creating content from a place of authenticity and creativity is the essence of becoming a successful content writer.

Shift your focus from just making money, to producing innovative solutions.

Once you’ve mastered that, THEN think about monetizing.

if you want to make money as a writer it's significantly easier to start with the end in mind start with a problem and then use writing as a vehicle to solve it but I'm not making decisions from a place of this is going to make me money now it's more on the I would classify as the art side as opposed to the business side but the ultimate goal at least for me is kind of Shifting that pendulum from I'm writing with the primary goal of making money to I'm writing with the primary goal of creating new things that might make money

Title: How Nicolas Cole Built a 7-Figure Writing Empire
Published: 2023-08-11 14:00:27 UTC
Description:

There is always someone who is currently working harder than you.

Anytime Nicolas Cole doesn’t want to do something, that little phrase pops back into his head, and that’s all it takes to turn his attitude around.

It’s less about motivation, and more about self discipline.

Success isn’t all about good luck and timing.

Those who achieve their goals, build 7-figure incomes, and dominate in their niche, do so because they consistently show up.

The narrative that you tell yourself determines the outcome.

podcast is a very terrible platform to launch if you have no audience I I was fortunate that I didn't really have a big audience myself but I had spent a long enough time around a handful of people that had big audiences that had gotten to know me for the very thing I was starting a podcast for you you always have one of those friends who you know you have a favor and it's like you hold on to it forever and then finally you're like I'm launching a podcast can you help and just like tell your audience about this thing I cashed all the favors in when I launched the podcast dude you're you're a pro now I feel like right uh what defines Pro I mean your podcaster for podcaster creator for a living right yes my wife quit her job and she is now joining the company so it is now both of us are doing this full-time which is bananas it's really bananas because you probably don't remember the first time we met but I do if I had to guess yeah I guess for some reason I'm envisioning a room maybe it's just the Canada thing with Aaron burry in the room I mean I know Aaron burry uh like many many moons ago and I'm like was that room in Ireland or was it at South by or was it just in San Francisco you're not you're not wrong okay it it was in Europe it was in 2011 Lo Webb Paris ah okay I remember going to Paris let's see hold on I actually don't have a good memory but when a photo comes up I always zap back into that reality and I remember being in a warehouse party with you me you Chris Barrett if you know who that is he's a PR guy okay and you were talking I think you might have recently sold your company to Google is that possible is that around then um yeah I think it was 2012 but in 2011. it could have been I think we were maybe we were we hadn't started but we knew it was happening anyway as far as I'm concerned I'm this like you know it's in my head at least in like country Canadian and I meet this like you know fast-moving Silicon Valley guy who knows everyone and who's building all this stuff and who's just you know really charming and no and just like knows you know knows where everything is going and I was like I need to be in San Francisco what am I doing and in my mind now fast forward to 2023 you've abandoned like you were at the Pinnacle of Silicon Valley building startups raising Venture and now we're now you're doing creation stuff how does it feel yeah apologies if anyone's watching the video because I was like I was so into this moment that I didn't know if we were actually recording and I'm like distracted looking at iPhoto trying to find photos of this trip to Paris but um I was at a conference yesterday in San Francisco and it was like a VC Tech startup conference and I was like do I even belong here anymore like I know everyone here yet it feels like it's a whole different world now I'm like yeah so it feels kind of fun to be at the I mean I'm not at the ground floor of Creator world right like people million it seems like millions of creators have done this before but for me it feels as exciting and new as it did back in I don't know 2008 when I first learned that people build tech companies for a living and I was like I need to go do that so I don't know I'm having a lot of fun learning a whole new industry I find that most people don't treat the Creator world like a business so I meet all these podcasters that are like oh gross like I never really thought about it like monetization like I just thought you just you know go to a network and they put ads in I didn't know there was a better more optimal way and so uh applying the principles of like high scale Venture startup to a new business that hasn't really taken that is fun that I love yeah I think there's a lot of creators who look at it just like from an art perspective I passionate about this particular thing I'm going to create videos about it or podcasts and then there's like this new wave of creators like yourself who know a little bit of the art but also the science and you're kind of putting it together and making money and also kind of doing tomorrow yeah yeah the art thing's interesting because I think I meet a lot of creators who are much younger they're like you know 24 and they're grinding and they tell me oh God what's a new tactic for tick tock and I was like do you like making Tick Tock videos and they're like no but like I feel like there's such an opportunity and I'm like yeah I'm not I'm not doing any I'm not doing a thing just because like it makes a lot of money I have to want to do it like the bar being I don't know almost 15 years older than these people in some cases 20. it's like I have to really want to do the thing and so it forces it almost like forces the art like there are people who don't care about money and do the thing they want to do always and then there are people who start out and they're like I don't have any money and I really care and I'm really grinding and then there are people who've had enough success that they're like look if I if I didn't make money we would need to move like we do not have enough money to live our lifestyle for the rest of our lives uh but we have enough that we could just like focus on things we love to do and so it's allowed me to treat it a little bit like an art in a way that 10 years ago maybe I would have been chasing making Tic Tac videos but some people I know that are making tickets they don't even like doing it they're just like they feel like that's the the opportunity I like the art piece so it's been what a couple years since you started this journey two years in May so a couple months passed but yeah two years and could you share a little bit about like the all the hacks uh Empire like how's it going yeah so when I started I didn't know what I wanted to do and I just knew I had a full-time job I just knew that I love going really deep on all the things like you know you know me personally but for people who are listening don't it's like if someone asks a question like what's the best way like what's the best way to get auto insurance I'm like I either know the answer because I've already done it or I'm like I need to know the answer and I'll go spend 50 hours the next week going to learn everything you can possibly learn about auto insurance I'll call 10 Brokers I'll get a quote from every company I'll read the policy terms and then I'll come back about you guys I went back and I looked it up here is everything you need to know that's just like my personality during the pandemic I didn't get to share any of that with anyone yet I also had more time than ever to do that kind of research and so I just felt like I needed an outlet and I didn't have the dinner parties to be like hey guys did you hear about this new crazy thing did you you know I just accumulated four million points doing this crazy like I just didn't have a place to share all that and so I was like maybe I'll try a podcast I'd started writing blog posts and I think I wrote two uh and then I stopped and then you know I've I've been on Twitter since I got excited about tech in 2007 but I just never became like the social media person but when I was running a startup I went on a bunch of podcasts as a guest to talk about financial planning and I was like oh it just felt like the most natural medium for me so started as a podcast and I had a newsletter sorry yeah certain interrupt isn't starting as a podcast like the worst possible idea like yeah when people ask me like oh hey like I really want to start a podcast I'm always like um before you start a podcast you need distribution yes so the the thing about podcasting that is worse than basically almost every other platform is that there is no built-in growth mechanism uh there is no built-in easy sharing mechanism it's like if you're reading an email and you're like I have an idea of a friend that would want this you hit like F Type three letters and hit you know command enter you know depending on what what uh email provided you have it's pretty quick on a podcast you have to like take your phone out of your pocket then you have to like go back to the episode page and then go back to the show page and then hit the share button and then click like the text message button and then type your friend's email text in and text feels very invasive and by the way both of those are still way harder than if you just post a video on YouTube and it seeds it out to 100 people and they love it then it's supposed to seed it to more and more and more people and that happens on lots of social platforms podcasting it's like there's no no there's nothing so yes you're right podcasting is a very terrible platform to launch if you have no audience and I I was fortunate that I didn't really have a big audience myself but I had spent a long enough time around a handful of people that had big audiences that had gotten to know me for the very thing I was starting a podcast for so when I said hey you know you always have one of those friends who you know you have a favor and it's like you hold on to it forever and then finally you're like I'm launching a podcast can you help and just like tell your audience about this thing I cashed all the favors in when I launched the podcast and I had a thing that I was known for in like money and financial optimization so I could go on a few other podcasts and say Hey I want to talk about this thing and I was actually you know an expert on that topic and so I think I had a little bit of an edge there and then I had this mailing list from you know a couple different aspects of my life I started a life updates one a travel one and I kind of let everyone know on those mailing lists hey I've got this new thing that gave me enough of a jumping off point that I could build an audience but without that you know I meet people that are like I have this podcast I'm on episode 100 I get about 50 downloads an episode and it's like you could do a hundred episodes of a podcast and still get only 50 downloads like most people that produce 100 pieces of content on any platform end up getting a bigger audience but podcasting so hard so what's your what's your advice for people who want to start a podcast don't have distribution and don't have you know well-known people to to plug their pod look I don't think anyone should start a podcast if you don't enjoy a podcast because for the first year podcast made no money so like yes I might have had listeners but like it was still a huge amount of work and the return was doing the podcast so I wouldn't advise anyone to start a podcast as like a business opportunity uh in general unless you have an audience so if you don't have an audience start it because you love it I think even with a tiny podcast I've met a ton of people who've been able to use it as a way to ask for a conversation with someone that otherwise they wouldn't be able to so if you really are a curious person and like learning from people use the podcast as a platform to have those conversations um you would be amazed at how many people will say say yes many of them will also say no but some of them will say yes and say yeah I'd love to come on your podcast so I didn't know Morgan hausel the is a writer and personal finance world and before the podcast had launched with no listeners I shot him a cold email and was like hey I got this podcast coming out it's about life and money and optimization will you come on he's like yes you know he didn't know that it had anything behind it so I think that for that reason it was great and a lot of people can do that and not care if there's an audience I've met plenty of people have podcasts Eric I have so many interesting conversations I've built an amazing Network I don't care if there's listeners it doesn't matter to me so know why you're doing it maybe it's just a creative outlet for you and it doesn't matter if anyone listens like it just is a platform for you to have a conversation in public or or just get stuff off your mind so I would say start it not for the reason of a business but if you do start it there are some things that I think give you an edge so one find a thing that you can be known for and leverage that to go on other podcasts where you're actually an expert and don't just send the email that I get 100 of every week that's like hey can I be a guest I did a thing be like hey I listen to your show I understand what you're looking for in a guest and I understand the kinds of topics you talk about here are a couple bullet points for what I think we could talk about that would make for a really great conversation I'm happy to do some more prep work um whenever I get those emails I'm like 50 of them convert whenever I get the email that's like I started a business like buildings you know lawn mowers and I'm like well that has nothing to do with my show like I don't even know why you sent this email I don't even reply I just archive it but when someone says Hey I've listened to 10 episodes of your show and I know that you like talking about optimizing areas of your life I've actually optimized this one area more than anyone here's what I know here are some of the takeaways your listeners will get those convert really well funny enough I I found that the bigger the name of the guest is completely almost inverse proportional to how well my listeners like the episode so uh it doesn't I care more about the content than you know the name of the person on the show really because that's really counterintuitive it's very counterintuitive and I think it's very unique to my show if I had a show that's like let's like hear all the juicy details of the lives of my guests people are more interested in the juicy details of the lives of people that they've heard of that they admire but if mine is tell me all the tactics I did an episode with a guy that I couldn't even find a lot of information about about rental car hacks people loved it and then I did an episode with Tony Hawk who I admire if you're on video you can see I'm literally assigned skateboard of Tony Hawk in my background um and it was super interesting but I wouldn't say that episode delivered as many tactics Tony I think maybe I could have figured this out in advance but he's one of those there are some people I could compare him to Kelly Slater and it's like some people are like very good at what they do and they are very intentional about how they do it and some people are just naturally so good at what they do and it's not because they're intentional they're just just you know otherworldly Tony is the latter it's like what's your routine he's like I skateboard and like you asked you asked Kelly said what's your routine he's like I wake up at this time I take this supplement I do this thing and I do take any supplements Tony and he's like yeah I gotta take like cholesterol meds because like that's what my doctor told you know like totally he's not someone who does that and that's it works I mean obviously he's like the you know everyone listening knows who he is like he's good at what he does but I wasn't able to deliver I was able to deliver a fun conversation and like I think I think it's a good listen but it wasn't the episode where you're like my life has changed after listening to this and I'm gonna do these seven things different or I now have I've gotten emails where it's like I listened to that episode and I made fourteen thousand dollars that was pretty cool um or like my marriage is better or my business is stronger that's what I want to deliver and so that honestly people are coming to the podcast for me they're not coming for the guest walk me through how this works so basically you you interview someone on the Pod it it becomes popular because people are sharing it with a lot of people is that what makes a popular episode a weird thing that I was talking about yesterday was that when you look at someone on social media or on YouTube and you're like how big is Their audience you're drawn to this number that is usually their number of subscribers their number of followers something podcasters there's no public number of followers okay so the only number people share and they don't even share it publicly that often is how many downloads you get per episode or how many downloads you get a month that number is completely different from the number of people who listen to the podcast or or who subscribe to the podcast let's say that better so if you're going to compare the number of people who listen to a podcast to the number of people who you know a YouTuber you'd look at how many videos on or how many views on average does their video get which depending on the YouTuber and the type of video could be four percent or ten percent of their overall subscriber base I think for for my podcast if I had to guess and I don't actually know the numbers and they vary drastically on Apple it's like 50 of the subscribers on Apple listen to an episode on average and on Spotify it's like 12 percent and and those numbers are only really available for Apple Spotify and Google so for all the other platforms which is like a meaningful percentage of listens I have no idea my guess is I have about five times as many subscribers as I do listeners on each episode so a an episode that does well is an episode where a higher percentage of the people that subscribe to the show listen to it and an episode that does poorly is one where a lower percentage but that range by the way on like day one downloads is anywhere from like 13 to 17 000 downloads on day one uh so it's not like you know and on average it's like 15. so like a bad episode is like 10 percent worse and a good episode's like 10 or 20 percent more um it's not like YouTube where you're scrolling through someone's feed history and you're like wow this guy's got ten thousand ten thousand ten thousand 17 175 000 like it's a very tight band so you know the only other metric I have is how many people are still listening at the end of the episode so how many people did I lose so if I compare okay how many people people downloaded it is a proxy for like is the topic or the title interesting and how long did they make it in the episode is a proxy for like was it a good episode uh do you spend a lot of time on titles um probably like 20 minutes I think it's some combo of me my wife my virtual assistant and chatgpt and like between the four of us we're like we're bouncing ideas off and then it's usually my wife and I at 9 00 PM taking all the data from all those sources and then we both are like that's it but I don't like a B test the title to see which one's gonna perform better or I don't have like a data I have a data back opinion on a lot of things because I like you know using analytics I don't I don't know what on titles you look at Tim Ferriss his titles are like four lines long and you'll get some other shows and the titles are like eight words and you ask them why and they're like yeah I think it's just so much better the SEO of podcasting like almost nothing is indexed except your show title so you know you could argue that really long titles will help people searching for random things in the in the App Store so they're not wrong about putting that in there um Spotify will index your summary of your your description of the episode but Apple only indexes the title so if you if you want to start a podcast and you want to create a popular podcast what recommendations do you have for people in terms of things that they can do to you know increase their probability of success honestly I think the most important thing is to to find some way to determine if you actually have like good content because you could spend all the time in the world growing a podcast but it's going to be people aren't going to stick around it's going to be so much harder so you need to find if you have a good podcast so first off can you actually explain why your podcast is different to other people like try that you know try to see if you can convince people about why your podcast is different because it's late enough it's early enough in podcasting that there's room for more podcasts it's late enough that you can't just like be a success because you have one and very often I meet people and they're like my podcast is great because I'm going to interview people and they're going to share all these awesome things and I'm like okay well there are a lot of podcasts that do that what's different about your podcast like why is someone going to listen to it do you have a different perspective like do you and your do you have co-host and you do interviews in a different way are you only interviewing a specific person in a niche where there aren't a lot of people doing that content like what is different about it so you could but you could have a different podcast and still suck at podcasting so like you might think I'm crazy but I don't really look at my metrics for for my podcast so I look at it every three months and I just look at downloads and and which which platforms like once every three months I'm like okay am I going in the right direction I'll look at it for 10 seconds and then I'll close the tab and I don't think you're crazy I I'm just like I'm not here for like I I think that first of all I think I have in intuitively I could see I could sense if if the podcast is doing well because people are like tweeting episodes I'm getting messages about hey I saw you know I listened to this episode it was really dope um and I realized when I first started the podcast I was really really into the metrics and I was trying to optimize everything and it was just a lot less fun for me now I'm just kind of like I'm just gonna invite interesting people they don't have to have the biggest audiences in the world I'm just gonna come up with a title that I think speaks to what this thing is I'm gonna post it on Twitter or on email when I think it makes sense and I mean I lost like my co-host I lost like six or eight months ago who has almost you know more than a million follow 1.5 million Collective followers or maybe even more 2 million Collective followers so I saw like a drop in downloads and I just look every three months and it's just been steadily increasing that's great I'm I'm you know and that's all that's all I care about like am I missing anything should I be no I don't even care anymore about downloads for me the only thing I care about now that this is a business this is like how we pay our bills I'm like are my sponsors renewing that's the only metric I care about and like if our sponsors are not renewing that means something's not working are we not growing fast enough are the reads not good like if you treat it like a business do I care like if I had half the downloads but I just kept all the people that are so excited and are supporting our sponsors that's fine like I'm doing the podcast not to be a celebrity but I like doing it every week and I like and it takes time so I need it to make enough money that I don't need to go get another job because then I couldn't do it every week um so I don't think you're wrong but I think if someone listening is like I have a podcast and I wanna you know try to figure out whether people what topics people like there are ways that you could look at the analytics to try to figure out which episodes are doing better or which episodes do people listen to longer I couldn't tell you on my own show like which episodes people listen to longer because I haven't looked at it because it's not a huge priority for me the way I decide what I do for episodes is like what am I interested in um and like if I am interested in a new topic now I'll do an episode on that you know it's not as if people want more Finance topics and I'm not interested in the topics they want to hear from I'm like I'm really sorry that'd probably make for a fun episode but it's just not interesting to me right now and it's not gonna be good content if I'm not interested so I have no problem with you not looking at downloads at all but if you're trying to figure out can I get this to a place that I could quit my job you probably want to look at those metrics because it's gonna be really important I don't know man like I hear stories about like uh I hear stories about Joe Rogan and Joe Rogan basically he he does like he spends a lot of time of course thinking about the guest and a lot of focus on the guest when he's interviewing the guest but from what I understand the guy is not really looking at metrics at all he's just focusing on who's interesting to interview and then having really interesting conversations and I wonder if that's just the that's the best way to do it like if the guy who has the most successful podcast of all time is barely looking at metrics well I think it like what I said my caveat was if you are at your day job and you're trying to figure out if I can quit my day job to do podcasting full-time like and you have to pay bills like you might want to know if the podcast has any path to paying your bills do I think that but but what I really think you should focus on is do I have a good podcast because and I think the way you're gonna have a good podcast is that if you love what you're doing so The Joe Rogan strategy is absolutely what you should be doing so I wouldn't say use let the metrics dictate what you do but let the metrics dictate whether you have a business or you have a passion project um and maybe you want to quit and just go all in and hope that it works but at some point you can't go to sponsors unless to monetize your show unless you have people that are listening to it so you have to at some point look Joe Rogan also has the luxury of having the largest podcast so like he doesn't care if it goes up or down by 10 because he's probably making what was his deal like 100 it was like you know ridiculous amount of money so yeah if I was making that much money up I would never even look at that over who cares like it doesn't matter how much how much money do you think you can make on your podcast in as a business like I don't know but eventually or uh yeah I think when I think about the vision for what I want to build and the newsletter is an interesting thing to to mention because when I first started the newsletter I was writing it's kind of adjacent to the podcast but it wasn't about the same topics and then it all clicked for me when someone emailed me and was like hey I'd really love you do an episode on insurance and I was like wait I did a newsletter on insurance two weeks ago like and they're like oh I don't I don't subscribe to the newsletter I was like oh you should and they're like I don't like reading newsletters I like listening to podcasts and I was like oh my gosh I originally thought I had all these people and I was giving them content in different forms and then I realized some people are newsletter people and not podcast people some people like scrolling Tick Tock and don't like either of the others and so each platform there are some people like all the platforms and some people that only like one or two but I they're not fully overlapping circles so I say that uh as a preface for I don't view all the hacks as a podcast I view it as a place to disseminate information and knowledge and and all kinds of things related to upgrading your life your money and your travel and ideally in ways that you don't have to spend a lot of money to do so I also think that there are things that I want to build that are way bigger than the podcast so my view is there are a couple companies in the states that people join memberships of because they want to get access to Great Deals right people join AAA so that they can get car towing so they can get you know hotel and rental car discounts people join AARP when they get old because there's all these great deals and discounts all that stuff there's like not a a thing like that for our kind of gen XYZ and maybe it's like the Chase Sapphire preferred or the Platinum Amex but I don't know why something like that needs to be tied to your credit card company and I don't trust credit card companies to be the most Nimble and come up with the coolest deals and they usually make really like tight single off Partnerships there's a company that did this that you probably know called Founders card and they did it for entrepreneurs but there's not a consumer version and so what my wife who's who's joining full-time on all the hacks next month and I are like really excited about is how can we build this community where you could become a member and get access to Amazing Ben benefits that far outweigh the cost of the membership I don't want like a patreon give me ten dollars a month because you like me I want a all the hex membership give me a hundred dollars a year because you save a thousand dollars a year by being a member and it's like an obvious you know no-brainer I think that if TR if AARP has 39 million members we could have 40 million members and if 40 million members are paying you know 100 a month that's like a that's a pretty big business I think uh you know so or a hundred dollars a year sorry so what does that do four billion in Revenue I don't know so if if you're starting this community you're going to use your newsletter podcast's distribution I think that's the I think that's the early early version of course like I don't have another distribution Channel I think once the like right now the benefits of joining for a very specific Niche it's like we have a couple awesome deals that outweigh the price of the membership but if you're not really interested in one or two of those companies it's a support Chris or a bet on the few future or be a part of the community right we do calls with each other we're taking a trip to Iceland like we're doing some cool stuff but it's small the moment we have like hundreds of amazing benefits is where it's like I don't know if I care about a podcast or newsletter I just want it's like an RO good Roi for anyone so we're not we're not near there but I just I just say that when you're like how big could this be I was like I don't know could it be doing four billion dollars a year like which look it's not doing that at all it's like that is you know but it could it could but yeah it's multiple multiple orders of magnitude away yeah um so I just don't view it as a podcast I think the ceiling on podcasts if you look at the top podcasts and let's let's pull you know a handful of extreme uh you know number one number twos out I think the ceiling is probably somewhere around 10 to 15 million dollars a year um and I think there are going to be you know 100 shows at that level and then everything below that is probably in the not everything but like the next tier down is like in the you know one to five million kind of range which is you know there's probably a thousand five thousand shows maybe doing that I don't know how well does uh Dave Ramsey do that is a question I don't know the answer to but that dude has a lot of money but yeah like a lot like uh Graham Stefan is a YouTuber that interviewed him and they went a little deep on his his Finance I mean he has a products and courses and books and his you know family has their own podcast and he's built this whole media Empire that I don't even think it makes sense to talk about in the same Realm uh well I think it's similar in the sense of Dave Ramsey in the US is one of those one of the leading if not the leading Financial advice guy yeah right and he he does that um I think his biggest channel is the radio I think um at least he used to be on the radio a bunch and and I know that he has an like an office building yeah real estate like in cash he like it's like essentially a skyscraper it's crazy yeah I just searched Dave Ramsey or Ramsey Solutions revenue and the numbers are they range from 20 to 515.6 million so he's doing a lot but but my point there was just that I don't think it's not the Pod like if you have a podcast and you don't Aspire for it to be more than a podcast you're not going to be at Dave Ramsey Revenue numbers uh that ceiling I gave was like the ceiling for people like look at Tim Ferriss has a podcast has sponsors but hasn't tried to turn it into anything else like it is a podcast he has a newsletter he's not trying to make a company he's not trying to have memberships he's not trying to sell merch he's not you know he's not doing all the other stuff and I think those kinds of businesses kind of cap out in the podcasting world with a handful of extreme outliers at at the like you know 10 15 million range I gotta think that a Tim Ferriss is making 7 to 12 million dollars a year on his podcast yeah I think his sponsor page on his website says here's how much it costs to sponsor the podcast so you can do the math yeah here's the cost to sponsor how many sponsors in each episode how many episodes a year so I think it's in that range and I think if I'm him and I'm making call it 10 million dollars a year with pretty little costs Michael for you know and he gets to have interesting conversations he does it his way you were on the Pod and he made you not pee for three hours you know like to be fair he gave me the offer but we were having this crazy interesting conversation then next thing you know is three hours and I was like I have to go to the bathroom like I just I can't do it I just peed myself yeah I mean I say right now how cool would be to be running this thing and four billion along the way I might be like that's not the best use of my time like I don't I'm excited to not be running a company with lots of employees and lots of stuff so you know I have this great vision because I just love helping people optimize their lives and there may be a point at which helping more and more and more people do it is not worth the payoff for me but you know I spent I was surprised to hear that to be honest like coming from you know you were at wealthfront before pretty big company now uh you know raised hundreds of millions of dollars you used to work at Google big company I'm surprised that you you would even consider a role of hey I want to go build like a billion dollar thing but I don't know if that billion dollar thing by the way has to have tons of employees uh maybe there's a path to it with LA I don't know I mean we're talking something so crazy we're just talking yeah yeah but you know just a couple friends talking my wife was telling me the other night she was it was like late in my au pair uh is playing a road trip and she was asking me about and she just said she needs to rent her car and I was like where are you gonna rent it you know like I went down this rabbit hole and she was like well we're gonna do this and my friend from Italy is she's going to road trip with her friend from Italy and they're both under 25 and I was like there's underage rental fees like when you're not 25 and you got to pay extra driver fees so we went through this whole thing by the end of the night she's now a member of AAA which saved her like 250 now she's got this car rented did uh you know I made her an authorized user on one of our cards so she could use it and get the free uh rental car insurance coverage and get free status on Hertz so she gets to upgrade and at the end of the night my wife's like why did you spend three hours like helping her save a couple hundred bucks I was like I can't help it like I it's like it wasn't that I thought it was a good Roi it's just when people email me and they're like hey I want to try to do this thing it's like almost impossible for me to not help people like find tweaks and ways to optimize their lives and so that makes me think I will not stop at the same time I have two young kids and I enjoy spending time with them and I don't want to run a big company so who knows where the where the ceiling of what I do is and there are a lot of people out there who found really you know wait different ways to run companies than the traditional traditional Silicon Valley VC backed company of you're the CEO and you have crazy burnout you hire all these people and and life's insane so I don't think Founders car which is a company with you know almost 100 000 members paying hundreds of dollars a year I think they have like a couple employees if I had to be honest with myself we're probably not going to get to four billion dollars in Revenue like let's be you know I can have aspirations just to keep pushing me uh but you know if if we had a hundred thousand members that'd be really cool I wonder if the prom's almost like how can I have Max 10 employees but have Revenue per employee be something crazy 100 million dollars per employee yeah the struggle here is the most optimal way to put money into a retirement account in the US is like solo 401ks are amazing right you can put like you can control all the features you can have a there's a thing called the mega backdoor Roth where you can put basically like sixty thousand dollars into your uh retirement accounts with tax benefits but the rule of a solo 401K is you can have no employees so my in my mind I'm like how can I build a massive company with zero W-2 employees other than your spouse your spouse can be a W-2 employee but no other no other employees so I'm not gonna decide the fate of what we're building on the tax advantage of a 401k but it was a cool exercise in my mind which is like what you just said except instead of 10 it's zero right I like how you're like yeah I'm not going to decide the fate of my company based on this tax advantage account but I'm not not gonna do it yeah it would be on brand yeah my uh right now we have a bunch of people working on different aspects I have someone helping with sponsors I have a virtual assistant I've got production crew and they're all 10.99. so I think it's possible you know I like this new world you know it's like no it's not let's all go to the office and you know it's a bit of a different vibe but I've really enjoyed it it's fun what other companies podcasts communities do you see and you're like those guys are doing a cool job like do you look up to any other I love what Peter or tea is doing um he is a doctor and the thing he's doing which I don't have another business to fund my life enough to do is he flipped the model on its head and he says Hey pay to be a member of our podcast and I'm gonna go to all these Brands and I'm gonna say hey I'm not going to charge you to for me to promote you know normal traditional sponsor deal is hey Brand I will talk about you to my audience and you will pay me a rate of X dollars per thousand people that download and that rate is somewhere between 20 and 50 so he goes to Brands and says hey give me an amazing deal funnel all the money you would want into the discounts that you're offering my members and then he goes out and tells members on the Pod he says hey we just did this amazing partnership with uh you know eight sleep and you're gonna get a deal that's so much better than the deal you're gonna get and you hear on every other podcast because every other podcast is getting paid that's not to say they're promoting a crappy product I work with Aid sleep I love Aid sleep we have one but they are paying me as a sponsor he doesn't have that sponsored relationship so he has amazing deals that he offers his members uh I love that model the downside is until you have a lot of members the model doesn't work right like you lose money um and so I can't make that transition now but I see a vision like into the future where over time maybe one of our ad slots switches to me talking about the partners then two then three you know like and eventually we get there so I love his model of offering extra benefit not necessarily extra content uh I I don't love this model where it's like we're gonna do two pods a week and one's paid and one's free I'm like I personally I'm like I want to put all the content out there for free and I want to find ways to offer products and services and other stuff to members uh and the idea of them getting better deals is even more interesting so I had a cool episode with David Chang the the chef uh of a restaurant in New York called Momofuku and a bunch of others when we got connected I found out he is I don't know what the right word is like a part owner in a company called any day which makes microwave cookware and during the pandemic he was like got obsessed with cooking at home and is kind of more of a home studio cook now and loves cooking the microwave and with this company they create a whole line of cookware and they were like hey we want to give a deal to your audience and they're like we could do an affiliate deal and I was like great we'll do an affiliate deal for everyone you get 15 off but for members you get 20 off and I don't want the affiliate rep you're like so that's like a slow way to transition into it is like as a member you get a better deal than everyone else and there are some people that are like wait a second add extra five percent is going to save me the cost of membership so I'll just join and hopefully before the year of their membership might expire we've launched a bunch of other things and they're like wow I keep saving more money this is so cool I think what you're touching upon is this shift towards like member only community experiences which I think is where things are going it's like how do I drive as much value as possible for this member experience just like benefit benefit benefit benefit benefit benefit benefit benefit benefit benefit benefit benefit so that like 10 bucks 20 bucks you know 50 a month makes it worth it I was I saw on Twitter today Andrew Wilkinson the founder of tiny Capital has like a Twitter subscription and it's like I don't know 40 or something 30 or 40 dollars a month took a lot of money I think for a Twitter subscription you know for premium content for a really busy guy um who might not you know be tweeting in this private only area that much but then I started reading you know he's gonna like pick someone random from his audience every month and have a 30 minute conversation and record the audio and post it and there's like just like 10 different benefits where once you're reading like benefit seven and eight you're kind of like all right like swipe my credit card and then when you first said that I was like I hate this idea of like all this gated content but then I realized he's kind of just hacking the platform he's like the platform is supposed to be sign up so that people pay for premium content he's like sign up you might get these audio conversations as premium content but he's he's adding more to it and that's where I think it's interesting and he's gamifying it too right he's saying like there's almost like a slot machine nature to it which is you could be one of the one in 500 people this month who has that conversation with me on zoom and the reality is that's probably 90 of the reason why people are joining they're they're playing in the casino of Andrew Wilkinson basically I did this so I used to work at wealthfront and the wealthfront cash account right now has I think it's a 4.55 apy in the US but if you refer someone to the cash account they give you a boost of half a percent up to 5.05 so I was like what I want a boost so I was like this is a great product I believe in it I put my money in it so I talked about it and you can only get four referrals and each referral I think is worth long works for three months so I share I told everyone I was like look you can get this boost here's my referral link and I got four and I was like crap I don't want any more I can't get any more every person that uses my link is gonna just be a total they'll get the half a percent and no no benefit to me so I pinged all of our members and I said hey if any member has a wealthfront account and they want a boost go to this little air table form and put it in and I still haven't found a site I can't believe bitly doesn't do this but I found this like nimble links If someone knows a better one let me know but Nimble links works for now and you go in and you type all these referral codes you get to choose whether it's random or like equally distributed so I chose the redirect evenly and now anytime someone goes to this URL that I can say here all the hacks.com WF Cash wealthfront Cash WF cash you'll just randomly get a referral link from one of our members and so I've had our members reach out to me and be like I'm now earning 50 more and this is my down payment let's say they're saving you know 200 000 uh for a down payment for a house they're gonna earn extra thousand dollars a year insane they paid 99 for an annual membership to all the hacks and they're gonna make a thousand dollars a year from four referrals and so we're now and now I'm like what are all the other brands out there that have interesting referral programs credit cards are an interesting one there are some cards where the referral deal is way better than the deal you get anywhere else so let's collect all these uh there's a window where Amex Platinum had 150 000 Point referral deal so I went to members and I said send me all your Amex Platinum referral link tanks in the pot I was like hey there's this awesome deal to get 150 000 Amex points with a platinum referral click this link and now it's all my members are getting all the bonus points from these things so I'm like giving them a distribution channel to earn uh or get perks or get referral stuff like they would have no platform to do that I don't have those referral links like when I log into my MX account my referral for the Platinum is like 50 000 points so nobody wants to use my referral link uh and so that's like a cool thing so I I push creators to think of unique ways that are on brand with them to come up with you know products or services or experiences that are really you know tied into their stuff that they could offer to people and I think people are thriving for that I'll give one more example that's crazy so I and this is two example of two things one I started my podcast it was an interview show and it was just me interviewing people about areas of their life to optimize and it was great I loved it and then a few things happened I was like gosh sometimes I couldn't find a guest that I thought could match the level of depth I've gone on something so when we bought a fractional home we bought like an eighth of a vacation home from a company called Picasso I was like I wonder what all the different ways there are to buy a vacation home I was like I wanted to talk to someone who's researched time shares you know vacation clubs the inspirado pass everything I couldn't find a single person that had done more research than me and I was like crap I can't do this episode and I was like What if I just do the episode no guess because I've already done all the research so I did that episode and I was like I should do this more so then I started doing solo episodes and then I was going on a trip to London and I was like I haven't been to London since and I have this maybe embarrassing but I have this memory of walking around London with a disc man with Alanis Morissette's Jagged Little Pill and I thought I was so cool uh whatever age I was and I was like I don't know anything about London clearly because that's that was my last experience as a child so I found someone online this woman Jess Dante who has a channel Called Love in London and it's she's like she makes travel guides you can download them you can buy them she's like makes all this content I was like do you want to record an episode about London and like everything someone needs to know about planning a trip to London she's like that'd be fun so I did that so then I met this guy who I had on the Pod talking about travel because he is like this really well-known travel blogger he's written lots of guidebooks and we did another one on Iceland now I want to go to Iceland but I didn't have a trip planned and at the end of that episode I was like God I want to go to Iceland so bad like and this guy knows he's been to every restaurant every Hotel every uh guest house every Fjord head he spent six months and saw everything he wrote like four lonely planets for Iceland and at by the end of the episode I was like I want to go on the trip you just told us to all go on and he and he was like why don't we just go on it and then we were like what if we just invite people to go on it so now in March next year we're going to Iceland this guy Brandon who knows everything about Iceland is hosting the trip all the best guides and tour companies he's met in his you know years of going to Iceland almost a decade are going to be leading the experiences and everything so we're going to take in all the hacks members trip to isil that like I would never have thought of that it kind of organically came up over time but that's the kind of cool stuff that I want to build in a membership that is different than what I think the average patreon is doing what it does is it builds like those people who are going to go on those that Iceland trip are going to be loyal to you for the for the rest of their lives whether you're whether you're trying to do it or not um you know be it the person who's getting a thousand dollars a year for for doing very little like they're they're gonna see a new all the hacks episode and pop up and they're just gonna be like yeah of course I'm listening to this that's my boy right like it's about reverse engineering That's my boy that's my girl whatever right I think it's really easy to follow other creators and just like kind of copy what they're doing and be like oh this person's doing a subscription I should do a subscription this person's doing a paid substack I should do a paid sub stack but it's really hard to be like how do I just cram as much value as possible to people and just like follow your curiosity to what you think that they're gonna want and just kind of test test get their feedback iterate yeah get feedback is a big thing we did a survey and I was like how do I make sure podcast listeners fill out a survey right it's very it's a lot to get a podcast listener to do anything they're like maybe they're on a run so I'm like I create this URL all the hacks.com survey and then I said okay here's what I'm gonna do my audience Loves Travel points miles so I was like I'm gonna personally transfer 10 000 Capital One points to anyone who takes to someone who takes the survey and then I also cashed in some points for two United uh tickets anywhere in North America Caribbean Hawaii and I was like I'm gonna pick someone that fills out the survey and they're gonna get two free tickets on United someone else is gonna get some Capital One points I reached out to some sponsors Fiori's like we're gonna give a hundred dollar gift card to someone now all of a sudden there's like tangible things you could win from taking a short survey and I didn't ask people what do you want me to do I was like what are you passionate about what are you excited about like what do you know questions to try to really get it get at it and that was kind of what inspired some of this people like I love traveling I love unique experiences and I was like ooh people want to travel and get unique experiences yeah I could interview you someone and talk about how they set it up or if we just gave it to them and so I could see a world where I don't know 2025 there might be 10 all the hack strips I might not go on all of them but you could be 100 certain that the person leading each one of those is gonna be so dialed in to create the most unique experience get the best deal like and make it just a once in a lifetime trip to that place and I think listeners gave me some of these ideas but you've got to get that feedback whether you're on Twitter whether on email the platform doesn't matter but if you can find out what really gets the people in your audience going and you can build products and services around that and not be afraid to test things out I yesterday so I may I'm a nerd people have haven't picked that up if you're not listening uh and I like credit card points so I made this crazy spreadsheet where I put like 50 credit cards in what they earn in all the categories and I put how much money I spend in every category and as you checked the credit cards it would go in and say which one has the best earning for each category how many points will I earn and it tells you at the end based on the one to 15 credit cards you picked how many points per dollar am I earning you know it's like if you have the AmEx gold now your grocery is getting four points per dollar uh and I was like talked about it so I was like can you share that with me and I was like I don't know it took me a lot of time so I put online I created a convertkit like product page and I said pay whatever you want a dollar like any if any I spent enough time on this that if you don't think it's worth a dollar fine like don't don't buy it we have like 100 people buy us buy like a Google sheet you know like so uh and if you remember I was like just log in and I put a link right here in the member dashboard so like by the way I love that model by the way the pay which you want model it's the I call it the the Radiohead In Rainbows model I'm guessing that's like an album they sold for whatever you wanted to pay it must have been in like 2004 like the peak of pirating music Radiohead was like go to this website download this album for free but download it from us and if you like the album how about you pay something and they did an analysis at the end what the average person paid the average person paid like seven or eight dollars and when you look at that versus you know what they were selling the album what they would have sold the album for which I think was like 9.99 like they actually made more money because they got more distribution free distribution it didn't go through some Network and go through it so they were stoked I love that yeah the only thing that I think is crazy is that one person I I was looking through we had all these sales the person who paid the most paid 100 but the membership is ninety nine dollars so I emailed them and I was like you could have gotten this for free if you became a member so like let's just get you into membership like yeah but that's such a smart it's actually I don't know who that was but that's actually such a smart way to get on your radar like if you want to get on some busy person's radar and they have like uh pay what you want thing pay as much as you can yeah I've heard of people that did this for maybe it was huberman lab or uh maybe it was the founders podcast but they were like we have this Pro tier where you could pay anything and someone just like it was like are it's ten dollars a month or 100 a year and someone just paid ten thousand dollars I think it was huberman lab because they fund research and so it was like a little bit of a non-profit-y kind of angle and it was just like had they put a premium tier of 500 they would have never seen you know what it could have been uh and this person was like I'm gonna pay ten thousand dollars that's what I wish I can do on Twitter subscriptions on Twitter subscriptions you have to set the amount you want to get paid big Miss Elon Musk yeah like big big Miss stripe actually has a way to do pay is what you want but not on a recurring basis that's right I mean stripe has a way to do it they just don't have a UI like they have these cool payment links but they can't do pay what you want on a recurring basis and I'm sure someone could teach me how to I mean literally it would be probably a very simple line of code but you just like type a number in and it generates a new thing but I'm not there yet Chachi petite could probably write it for me I think pay what you want is is the new bad to cart because in our world in the Creator world because when you build all this Goodwill with communities you're gonna get a bunch of whales spend a lot of money yeah the thing that I want to figure out I don't know no one I haven't seen anyone you gave me this example with Radiohead and maybe maybe it'll just work so maybe I'll test this next but what I wanted was get it for free and then pay what you want after because I want it's hard when you're giving someone something that they don't know what the experience is like to get them to even know what it would be worth you're like what is this spreadsheet Worth to me I don't know so the way I did it was I made a loom video and I walked through it all and I was like here's exactly how it works but what I wanted was like it's almost like a tip at a restaurant it's like off your card and and like we know you're committed to pay something and then a day later we say like do you wanna you know what do you want to pay or or it's like what do you you know from one to five stars would you rate this and like five stars is this amount of money four stars is this amount of money I like that I've seen some that say like the average people pay this like on average people pay this right but I just think there's there's not a good easy way to do the payment after the fact that's right it's almost like pay a dollar and then I'm gonna hit you up and ask you if you want to pay more later uh because I really only want you to pay me tickets you can't say pay a dollar it has to be you have to remove all the friction you have to yeah yeah and and you just have to trust that people I'll try it try it I got I got so many different spreadsheets and notion boards that I that I've like researched something on uh someone you're sitting on a gold mine dude you're literally sitting on a gold mine so we'll see stay tuned for round two of all of these updates so before we bounce I asked you a lot of questions do you have one question for me one one how uh so I want to get your take on something that I'm dealing with which is I have this podcast there's a lot of great content I've decided that each time I do a podcast on a topic I'm going to translate that to a newsletter version of it and I feel like newsletter and podcast I have down and I am awful at you like creating any value for anyone on let's call it just for the scope of this since I only get one question you know social I feel like you understand that world like what should I be doing should I just ignore it and focus on the platforms that are feel natural or am I totally missing out on things I think my instinct is I hate repurposing like I don't think people want to watch a clip of a podcast as much as they want to watch something that's natively made for that platform but at the same time that's just like 10x the work so am I crazy for not clipping my show and putting it on social am I more crazy if I pay someone to do that because I always see these tweets about how profitable all like the same people are like hey use my clipping Agency for five thousand dollars a month it's amazing are the same people that are like I love running this clipping agency that's a 90 margin business so on the clipping agency bit by the way we looked at buying some of the bigger clip clip agencies and what we learned was their churn is so so high okay and their turn is so high because people don't see results like their cell is hey take this podcast like you're Chris you're already doing a podcast we'll just clip it up you'll have to do no work we're gonna put some Alex hermosi style like captions on it and you're you know you'll be at a hundred thousand YouTube subscribers in six months you try it and it doesn't work and and I've been guilty of this too like I've tried it and it doesn't work my take on short clips is specifically with podcasts but it extends to other areas too is the era of repurposing Clips is basically over unless you have a crazy huge guess like a Tim Ferriss not worth it on if I were you like if you you know you look at me like I I get I don't know 10 to 50 million tweet Impressions every single month and it's not even that that's all a lot of Impressions it is but the important part is I could use I could share links like I I haven't checked but I probably I probably send 50 to 100 000 visits per month at least to different things that I am trying to promote via my podcast my email newsletter products that I want to sell and like to me I look at your Twitter and it's like I I can't I I honestly can't believe given that you're like who you are and what you've done and they've built social products in the past like that you you you have such a graveyard and you have so much content that you can all you have to do is figure out how to put it in two lines or one-line bangers or long form threads now it literally like you probably you probably if I were you what I would do is I would find a writing partner maybe it's your wife maybe someone else just get them to ask you questions and go through a bunch of old newsletters and interviews and just try to how can I write these ideas in one line and just try to have like a thousand of them and just have a thousand one-liners and then what I would do is I'd probably take 20 of them or or a third of them and create images specifically for those one-line bangers to explain the points better and also because the Twitter algorithm favors images right now but like like infographicy kind of images not like a random stock photo no infographically like images that actually are cool and interesting to look at that also help support and explain the idea that you're trying to get across and if you did that like look at you know people who who's done that in the past like people like Jack butcher I don't know if you know who that is you know his his whole thing is visualize value here's a community called visualize value and he would do these black and white images daily on Twitter and Instagram or almost daily and like during the pandemic went from like zero to 200 000 followers like pretty consistently and it was just because you took complex ideas he boiled it down to a simple concept and used an image to explain it and that's exactly what you can be doing with all the hacks in your personal brand I love it it's funny because I know a guy named Brian feraldi who does this in investing and I love his content and I'm like he's great I was chatting with him on Twitter today he's awesome and you could easily yeah okay that that's that's what you should be doing um there's a higher likelihood that that person that's excited to help with a project like this listens to your show than mine so if that's you reach out to me Chris at Chris hutchins.com Chris is at all the hacks.com hit him up also good idea on the on the podcast survey if you're listening to this just DM me on Twitter what what you hate about this podcast and what you like about it and what and what would be a cool experience to do with you what am I missing what if someone's not on Twitter you got to give them more ways to get in front of you maybe your audience is all on Twitter I think my audience is like very much not on Twitter or you could uh comment on the YouTube on YouTube I read all the comments comment on this video um where can people find all the hacks and your whole empire that you're building all the hacks search it here search it online go to all the hacks.com fortunately I think that the name is a double-edged sword people love it it's exciting and brands are like I don't know if I want to be around that brand but uh for now that's a brand it's easy to find love it thanks Chris all right thanks for having me

Title: Turning Down $100 Million, With Nicolas Cole
Published: 2023-08-09 14:00:04 UTC
Description:
https://www.youtube.com/@GregIsenberg

In the world of entrepreneurship, success is often associated with the big "yes" moments—the deals closed, the millions earned, and the opportunities embraced.

However, there's an equally significant aspect that we rarely hear about—the power of saying "no.”

Not every opportunity is a perfect fit.

When someone offers you a massive deal with millions of dollars, it may seem like a dream come true.

But every opportunity comes with strings attached.

Taking up such an offer might mean losing the autonomy and freedom that fueled your entrepreneurial spirit in the first place.

something I wish people would share more isn't the things that they choose to do it's the things they choose to say no to because you know when someone offers you two million or someone offers you a hundred million dollars like they're not just giving you that there's a lot of strings that come with that and all of a sudden you have a boss and all of a sudden you have expectations right and the life that you've built for yourself sort of goes out the window why did you turn down 100 million because a lot of people look at that and they're like what how could you turn that down like that's my biggest dream but that sort of circles back to what version of Entrepreneurship do you want to live and play what type of Life Do you want to build

Title: The Challenge of Software Based Services
Published: 2023-08-07 14:00:11 UTC
Description:
https://www.youtube.com/@GregIsenberg

Building a product, especially in the realm of software, is a whole new ball game compared to building a services based business.

In services, the human touch allows for flexibility and nuanced problem-solving.

However, in software, the code becomes the orchestrator, demanding an intimate understanding of the problem at hand. This means diving deep into the intricacies and complexities to ensure the software addresses the specific needs of users.

Building Product is hard one of the big differences I learned between services and software is in Services it growth assistant or ampush you could kind of tell me your problem in a vague term you know here's my issue and I'd say well here's a human this human can probably adjust themselves to solve that really nuanced specific problem you have in software the code has to do that and that means you really have to get intimate with a problem and understand in a really deep way and I think it's just a very different challenge

Title: Start Working WITH Your Competitors, Nicolas Cole Explains Why
Published: 2023-08-06 14:00:28 UTC
Description:
https://www.youtube.com/@GregIsenberg

It might seem contradictory, but having competitors in your niche is actually an advantage.

As Nicolas Cole (one of the most-read writers on the internet) explains, having competitors means your category, or niche, is growing.

Other players in the category act as catalysts, expanding the overall market and creating new possibilities for everyone involved, including you. 

Instead of viewing competitors as rivals, recognize them as partners in a collective journey, and grow together.

A rising tide lifts all boats.

Title: The Reality of Entrepreneurship Might Be More Boring Than You Think

Description:
https://www.youtube.com/@GregIsenberg

A lot of entrepreneurs, or wannabe entrepreneurs, think of entrepreneurship as something that’s super exciting.

But the reality can be far from it.

On social media we only see the highlights from founders and business owners.

But behind that is the nitty-gritty aspects that may seem less glamorous, but are vital for growth.

Becoming a stellar manager, trainer, and an expert at documenting processes may not be thrilling, but it's the backbone of scaling services.

to run Services is hard enough to scale Services you have to become a great manager you have to become a great trainer you have to get good at writing things down it's boring ask stuff that helps you scale Services businesses in particular you got to give a lot of feedback to people you got to do a lot of things that are the opposite of launch something on Twitter and see if it'll grow and scale and I think it's just you either got to pair yourself with the right person or you gotta create space in your mind that those things are important

hey welcome back to the channel in today's video I want to share a process that's going to turn you into an idea machine you'll learn how to capture validate and transform your thoughts into beautifully packaged public-facing winners whether you're a content creator founder or just someone who's trying to unlock creativity this is going to help you create winning ideas that's going to make an impact so let's dive in my name is Greg Eisenberg and I love sharing tips and tricks on how to unlock productivity and creativity if you want to stay up to date with the latest tips and tricks you're going to want to subscribe right now today I'm going to walk you through my process for how I validate content that I create that has been seen by hundreds of millions of people and products that have been used by hundreds of millions of people number one idealists number two gardening number three timing number four scroll Stoppers number five validating this might mean nothing to you right now but watch until the end of this video so I can explain each one to you I was shocked to hear that the median tweet gets zero likes and zero retweets zero it may not feel that way when you're scrolling Twitter but tweets out of hundreds and thousands of likes but that's just the way the algorithm is programmed so that means most Twitter users the ones you don't see are screaming into the void and that's not where you want to be so how do you come up with content that performs all the time that's where my idea generation workflow comes in handy here's how the power of idealists number one start by creating a dedicated space to capture all of your ideas I personally use notion I love it but you can use a journal like a ha an actual old school journal or you can use something like the notes app then you're going to want to divide your ideas into a bunch of categories like logos or names Instagram reels tweets some of the ideas come from things I see in everyday life I was at the beach the other day I saw an umbrella a beach umbrella and I wrote that down I'm like that could be a logo other ideas come from listening to podcasts or watching YouTube I also have a page on my notes tap that is called ideas for startups that one is completely unstructured though so a lot of you might think that some of your ideas might be dumb or silly and that's totally okay there's literally no bad ideas at this point because you never know where one of these ideas could lead you I'll give you an example I recently came up with a logo for a Fortune 500 client I got the idea because I was walking on the street and I saw a toddler with a lollipop and that particular lollipop just looked perfect as a logo inspiration comes from the strangest places you just gotta bottle it up number two now it's time to Garden your best ideas schedule dedicated time to review your idea lists I spent 30 minutes twice a week where I remove all my distractions I grab a coffee or tea I go through my list and I distill the best possible ones I think of it as gardening where I'm nurturing and cultivating these ideas I ask myself which of these ideas are standing out to me I synthesize I refine the ideas to make it way more clear and concise number three the importance of timing the most important question you can ask yourself when you're going through these ideas is why now why should I be tweeting this right now why does this piece of content need to come out right this second why would people stop what they're doing and buy this product it's key to consider what's going on in your Niche right now what are the conversations that are happening because ideas that come out at the exact right time just have a way higher likelihood to succeed and spread like wildfire for example in my world a lot of people are talking about how do you use AI to boost your productivity so I had this idea for a free community that was about learning how to boost your productivity using Ai and I even had the name for it you probably need a robot.com but I sat on it for eight months because the timing wasn't right a few months ago the timing was perfect tweeted about it it went ballistic 25 000 people rushed into our Discord right away that same idea would have gone nowhere six months ago timing isn't everything but it's a lot number four or crafting scroll stopping content you want to create scroll Stoppers only focus on creating inside bombs inside bombs are something that they need to stop and consume right away the best way to come up with them is to challenge yourself to think completely outside the box and come up with something that's original here's how I think about it every time you see my name I want it to be associated with a scroll stopping idea so the next time you see my name you're definitely gonna stop you know that at Greg Eisenberg only shares bangers so when I'm combing through my content ideas I'm always prioritizing based on scroll stopping so you might be thinking how do I create scroll stopping content here's some of my criteria it needs to be controversial to some it needs to be hell yeah to others and either needs to make me laugh or make me nod number five validating your ideas everything up into this point has been internal if an idea is really sticking out to me here's what I do I throw it up on Twitter and Linkedin as a one-liner remember the median tweak gets your legs so if you have no audience on a place like Twitter LinkedIn is a really good place to start if you want to focus on business content so if that one liner resonates I'll turn it into a longer Twitter thread or LinkedIn post I type it all up in 10 to 15 minutes then I throw it into chat GPT I use the prom pretend like you're my copy editor and my chat GPT do the rest it cleans up my post and once that's ready I'll post it now with that longer post resonates then I make it into a longer newsletter or a blog post if that hits I might even turn it into a longer video or have a whole podcast on it and if that works I might even create a business out of this exact idea and there you have it folks that's my exact content creation process that I've used to create content that hundreds of millions of people have seen I hope you're able to steal some of it and validate some of your own awesome ideas also I'm curious about what your process is would love for you to let me know in the comment section if you like this video please subscribe to this Channel That's how I know I'm doing good work it's right below this video thank you so much for watching and I'll see you next time

a cool concept Dickie and I've been talking about a lot is like this idea of how much revenue can you produce per unit of attention if you look at some creators that have hundreds of thousands or even millions of followers and then you do the the math of like what's their revenue relative to the units of attention that they're producing their ratio is really unimpressive you're like oh you're doing half a billion views a month but you're only doing 70 grand a month right like not a great ratio I would rather my attention be lower but my profitability per unit of attention be significantly higher dude what are you what are you drinking this is my my morning protein shake both you and Dicky Bush have very I feel like schedules like morning schedules tight schedules actually not even just morning like morning afternoon is that right yeah Dickie I think is a a bit more dialed than than I am I've tried I've tried to let go a little bit over the past couple years but I mean I guess even still I am my I am in my ways I I still have a pretty strict routine what's it what's a typical day in the life of coal say I'm gonna get up at 6 or 6 30 but actually get up at like seven or seven thirty there we go that's the honesty I'd like to hear yeah uh I try but I'm I'm not a morning person try and like maybe stretch a little bit in the morning if I can just get the body moving uh lately I've been I used to eat a big breakfast I realized that was kind of like weighing me down might be age as I get older so now I just do a protein shake with like peanut butter coconut water you know I chug one of these mountain valleys first thing in the morning hydration very important and then it just depends on the day like some some days especially because ship 30 and everything is just growing so some mornings are all team meetings you know getting people aligned for the day and then I do deep work in the afternoon other days more like middle of the week if people know what they're working on then my mornings are you know I leave them pretty empty so I can just like go straight into writing or work or something and then check in with the team around like one or two p.m and then lately this is like the first year I've been back in a good uh gym routine usually around like three three or four I'll go hit the gym two days a week I do gym and physical therapy back to back just kind of work on mobility and stuff and then after that like day's usually done come back maybe close out some slacks answer a couple emails do what I got to do and then spend the rest of the night with uh with Alyssa my fiance which is pretty dope that you're basically stopping to work at three or four every single day yeah it took a lot I mean you know though like it took a long time to get there like I you don't have that luxury in your 20s you don't have that luxury when you're like first starting my first business I didn't have that even when we first started ship 30 like I was I that was hard I mean we were putting in work you know like I was up working seven eight a.m I might stop around four or five for dinner then I'd go work another three hours you know seven to ten finish some stuff like there was definitely a year year and a half there where Dicky and I were pushing it really hard and it feels like Dickie is also pushing it really hard like I remember last time we hung out I was like come to dinner it's gonna be with a bunch of great people and and you're like I don't know Dickey's gonna be working uh and then you send me the text like ah we're working you know we are working late night or Dicky's working late now so do you find you you both work the same or is one of you working harder than the other because I think the last thing you want in a partnership is any sort of resentment where one person is working harder than the other I think we both work about the same there there are periods where just because we have different like different not even like responsibilities in the business but there's just things that I'm better at than him and things that he's way better at than me and so there's certain things that we're building where sometimes I'm in a you know like when you uh the dinner example like that was right when we were launching our ghost writing program and at that time I had a little bit more bandwidth because I had already like the month or two before was my grind month you know and so that month or two before like I didn't do anything but just work go to the gym sleep and I and I basically built the whole ghost riding curriculum in 30 days you know which is the equivalent of like writing a whole book and recording videos in 30 days it was a lot and so I had already done that work and during that time Dicky didn't have like as much to work on because I was the bottleneck you know I needed to create this curriculum but then a month later you know when you were like hey come out to dinner like then that he was in that period you know so he was like okay well now the curriculum's done now I got to go build all the infrastructure and everything for this so I think we work the same sometimes it overlaps sometimes it's I'm more one month he's more another month but like yeah I think we just both have that personality we both enjoy working you know I I enjoy being dialed in like that and so does he it sounds like you adopt the hunter mentality like the Hunter and rest mentality which is there's times where you're gonna hunt and you're gonna you're gonna kill that saber-tooth tiger and and and feast and when you're feasting like you're resting and you're gearing up for the next big hunt and you and Dicky might do it at different different times and by the way I want to like set the stage here with like who you and Dicky are and what you built ship 30 for 30 seven figures a year uh business um both of you have grown to like together I don't know five six hundred thousand followers on platforms at least in the last few years um and someone asked me recently who's one of the most underrated Twitter Roddy is actually how he does Twitter Roddy yeah and I said Cole from ship 30 for 30. under even though you're getting pretty rated because like you're you're you're PR you know a lot of people know you I still feel like you're underrated uh in the sense of like you're dialed in when it comes to building content writing for the internet Community you know building SAS products with typeshare like you you're building a an Empire through writing and and it's it's cool to see well I appreciate that I uh whether it's true or not I mean I don't know I think other people will have to be the judge but I certainly feel that way and I think kind of no matter um I think no matter how much we build I imagine I will always feel that way like I just perpetually it might just be a personality trait but I I have always enjoyed being the the unsuspecting threat in the room you know like one of one of my like Dark Twisted fantasies is always thinking like if I go to a industry event and there's a panel and everyone's real really excited to hear all these other big name people talk and then I'm on the panel and by the end of that you will know you will know that I am not just some guy you know and I that's definitely the ego part of me but it but it also I really enjoy being more unsuspecting you know and I really enjoy being in rooms with smart people and not not even like I have something to prove to them it's like I I constantly have something to prove to myself like I always want to know how much further can I go and growing up my dad used to have this t-shirt my dad was really busy and you know cared a lot about his career and so I have sporadic memories you know spending time with him but he used to wear this t-shirt when he would wake up and work out every single morning it was like a Nike t-shirt it might even have been an and one t-shirt way back in the day and on the back is this like kind of big long monologue and it's like somewhere someone is practicing harder than you they're spending more time in the gym than you they're sweating more than you they're pushing themselves harder than you and when you meet them you will lose and I want and he wore I mean my dad was like successful but like kind of cheap and so he never bought a new workout t-shirt he wore the same workout t-shirt like every single morning all my entire life all growing up and so every morning I would wake up and I would like see him downstairs and I would read the back of that T-shirt and that it was such a small thing but it had such a huge impact on me and I've thought about that seriously like my whole life as I'm just like I am that somewhere someone is working harder than you and when you meet them you will lose and I've just like fully internalized that I was actually thinking about something similar this morning so I woke up it's kind of like a cloudy rainy day here and I was talking to my fiance and I was like usually I go for a walk in the morning and I was like you know what I don't want to go for a walk it's like probably gonna rain really hard and I just like I'm not feeling it and she's like no you should go you should go so I was like okay so I go for my walk and I was thinking about why did I actually make the mental like cross the mental hurdle of like I'm not gonna go do this thing that I know is good for me and I was thinking about it and I was like I remember growing up my grandfather who lived well into his 90s and was in great shape would go for daily walks and I grew up where all my aunts and uncles live within like a one mile radius basically of each other and my grandfather would basically walk to all of us and he would kind of just like ring the doorbell would ring it's like who's that like is it you know who is there and oh it's my grandfather just like walked there it just got me thinking about like growing up nature versus nurture and how these like seemingly minor insignificant insignificant things that our parents grandparents Aunts Uncles cousins do in their lives some of them stick with you I mean not to you know we don't have to like go down the political rabbit hole right but uh recently the whole affirmative action thing getting turned over and I think that's that's like one of the Nuance points that is very difficult for people to hold in their head is where you grew up and this and the sort of things like even even the fact that I had a dad so already an advantage you know had a dad that even though you know we didn't have a lot of talks growing up and like it's not like he sat me down and like explained work ethic to me and stuff but even just the fact that in my home I could observe a male figure showing up and doing the repetitive thing every single morning huge huge nurture Advantage you know and I don't think you really realize it until you get later in life and same with you it's like just just observing how people close to you the choices they made the the ways that They Carried themselves um the choice of doing the hard thing versus the easy thing like I don't think we really realize how much we soak those things up and then you see other people who don't have those things you know and then it's like Society turns to them and it's like well why don't why why aren't you different why don't you have that it's like well you didn't have any of the nurturing you didn't have the model you didn't have the any you know so yeah I've been thinking about that a lot lately too it's a bit of like a ripple effect right like it's not about the fact that your dad wore that t-shirt so much so the fact that like what it meant what that t-shirt meant was he showed up to work every day he compared himself to the greats not like people worse than him and he did it publicly basically like he did within your family to to let your family know working out is really important health is really important and being better than other people is really important so that so when I hear stories about like you almost were like a professional hockey player you were one of the best World of Warcraft people you start a Twitter account to zero to two hundred thousand in two years you start a company and you're making like seven figures of cash flow and teaching a whole generation of people to go make a million dollars as a writer and then someone asked me oh like how did Cole and Dicky get there they must be lucky I'm like dude no no no like my aunts no like no yeah just just know that's why I love the somewhere someone is working harder than you yeah like I tell myself that every single day and any any time I don't want to do something that little phrase like pops back into my head and I all and that's all it takes like do you ever watch the Michael Jordan um documentary The Last Dance right and like how he would like make up little narratives for himself like I didn't really realize how many years that I've done that where the moment that I'm tired or the moment I don't want to do something or whatever like that little phrase comes in somewhere someone is working harder than you and it doesn't even have to be a specific per I just imagine this like it doesn't have a name it's not a real person I just imagine someone me waking up one day and going wow they did the thing that I always wanted to do and I just get filled with you know every emotion from frustration to drive to like anticipated Joy like what will that feel like when I get you know and it's just like this endless source of motivation for me how much do you think about competition of ship 30 for 30 and and your whole empire with other writing programs ghost writing programs do you think about it a lot not not really I mean so one of a cool business concept that I that I got that I've learned and been introduced to over the past couple years and I learned this from uh Christopher and Eddie who I started uh category pirates with which was a separate paid newsletter it was all about category design and one of the cool uh category design not even principles but just um like mathematical takeaways is that when you're the leader in a category the best thing that you can do is grow the category the more that the category grows the more that you benefit you know so the more that the smartphone category grows the more Apple benefits the more the electric car category grows the more Tesla benefits so I look at other writing programs and and other writers and other people talking about the same things as a net positive because they are growing the pie and the bigger the pie gets the more that we grow as well you know and so through that lens like that's why it's a bit of a contradiction because on the one hand I am a highly competitive person but it's really not competition with someone specific it's just Within Myself and then on the other hand I'm very aware of these category Dynamics where business is a little bit of a winner take all in the sense that the category King captures the majority of the category and the upside but the reality is it's also not winner take all because as the category grows lots of other people can be successful and be part of that upside as well so it's like I don't even think about it as having competition like they're they're all Partners they're all helping grow this category that we're at the Forefront of so thank you you know that's a that's a very American way of looking at it in a good way I think uh Americans Americans come at it with a lot and I love I love this about America which is you know if I'm eating I want everyone to eat type thing like let's Feast together and like it's it's all about growing the pie and not from a scarcity mindset it's really from an abundance mindset it's the best way to describe it which which is I love I love that about it I think people from like Europe and Canada often are more in a protective mindset it's like hey I built this thing and I'm just trying to like build walls around it so I could protect as much as possible I think the reality is if you're building a venture-backed business it really is winner take most like you you have to you have to act like it is yeah you have to act like it is and and to be honest like you have to Google captures 90 of search uh Facebook captures 90 of social right it is a winner take most um but I think in our world in the non-venture-backed world where you know we're building cash flowing businesses seven eight figures businesses which by the way might have an Enterprise Value in a few years of nine figures or high even high nine figures but when you're building cash flowing businesses you really can come at it like there's really no reason why you should come at it with a scarcity mindset in my opinion yeah I agree I think sort of saying it differently too it it just depends on what type of business you know because inherently if you're so if you're venture-backed you're most likely not building like an education business like you wouldn't really raise money to build a ship 30. no what do you need the money for right should I talk about that for one second sure Venture back company called me yesterday I'm an investor it's they're doing 25 million in AR okay they're doing really well they launch a quasi service based business uh attached to their SAS product okay they do it just to grease their flywheel to get people to use their SAS product more I'm looking at the numbers and I'm like this could be like they could be cash flowing 50 million dollars a year just from this service business I speak to the founder I'm like so what are you gonna do here he's like you know I'm actually thinking of shutting down shutting down the service part because it doesn't scale why oh it doesn't scale I was like well do you see the opportunity I see like I see look at these metrics he goes I know it kind of hurts me but what am I gonna do make 50 million dollars literally that's what he said because the expectations and the incentives are upside down you know when you go raise all that money like that I've I've written a bunch about this and it was a painful lesson in my first business which is every time you raise money your chances of success don't go up they go down you just kicked the goal post way further right so if you raise a million dollars and then you get acquired for 5 million that's not a that's a that's a failure you know if you raise 10 million and you don't make it to at least 100 million that's a failure you know whereas if you don't raise money or if you do like a very small friends and family or maybe strategic and you're like I just need half a million to get off the ground but I'm never going to raise money again then you build a cash flow business bootstrap or with a small round you get to a couple million you get 5 million 10 million 15 million like life-changing outcome life-changing outcome I sort of I keep asking myself like in hindsight it was like was I just never introduced to that perspective or was I just naive and didn't want to hear it because when I was a lot younger it was like you're either building Uber or you're working a full-time job like I looked at it in such a binary sort of term it's like billionaire or bust and you start to realize as you build things you do not you do not need to do that and the funny part is most Founders if you were cash flowing two million dollars a year you would your desire to go build a billion dollar business would not go up it would go down you would be like why would I expend all that effort I don't real chance I don't actually need all that two million dollars a year basically lets me live and do whatever I want and so I think that's what's weird is like when you're especially in your 20s but you're like in your 20s you have like 10 grand to your name you know and you think I have to go make a hundred million dollars to be happy and it's like you don't even know the feeling of making half a million dollars a year and if you did you would realize that like you don't need as much as you think you need you can basically do everything you want to do on two or three million dollars a year which is now that I've like built a couple businesses you start to realize like that is not as hard to build as oh I gotta go build the next Google it's way easier to do that we were texting about this the other day we're just talking about how much how much money do you really need should we talk about it publicly here yeah I mean I think there it's a there's a Nuance in there which is how much money do you really need versus how much do you want versus how much do you think you need versus how much do you think you want because I think all those are four different answers you know and so for you let's let's talk about it so mentally I remember I had a couple mentors that have each told me like 20 million is the goal you know if if you get to 20 million basically you're you can cover all your yearly expenses and and that is like actually the definition of like you don't really have to work again the reality is I mean you can get to the you don't have to work again off of 2 million if you wanted to it's just it's the it's the level of Lifestyle you know like if you're living in the middle of nowhere in Idaho you don't need as much to cover your living expenses versus if you're like I want to never have to work again but I want to live in Miami or I want to live in LA or I want to live in New York I want to talk about this concept of never having to work again a lot of us follow these subreddits like fire financial Independence retire early fat fire lean fire all the chubby fire it's getting really really popular I've taken some time off in between things and it gets boring realistically any of us or if you're listening to this podcast realistically you would be one of those people that would be bored doing nothing nothing you can't and if you're gonna do something there's going to be some economic value associated with it if you decide to do a passion project where you open up a coffee shop maybe your coffee Shop's not going to make a lot of money but you might make something you know you're buying coffee for 50 cents you sell for two dollars so I think that a lot of people are actually chasing this net worth dollar amount so that they can quote unquote you know retire but I think that like I feel retired right now straight up what does retirement mean retirement means that you can do whatever you want to do when you you know wake up every day isn't it yeah I mean I think I agree generally so the the Nuance for me is one of the things that I've really learned especially in the domain of writing is that there's two very different ways of approaching writing and one is I like to think of it as art and business and the business side of thinking about writing is starting with the end in mind and working in Reverse so it's like you know why have we chosen to spend so much time on ship 30 well we see a need we see problems we see how to solve it we solve it with writing we work in Reverse you know why did we launch our premium ghost Writing Academy we see a problem we see a need we know how to solve it we know if we solve it that's valuable we work in reverse and so a lot of what I talk about in a lot of where I've gotten to in my career as a writer is like if I want to make money as a writer or if I'm talking to someone else if you want to make money as a writer it's significantly easier to start with the end in mind start with a problem and then use writing as a vehicle to solve it when I think about quote unquote Financial Freedom or retirement or like what's that net worth number I think a lot more about the other side which is the art of writing and there's a lot of things that I want to write like I I believe that I have the capacity to write the next Game of Thrones I believe I have the capacity to write some of the best-selling Memoirs of all time I have some really cool like category shifting ideas in terms of Art and writing and new structures but if I'm really honest with myself could those make money yeah like if you really are able to create the next Game of Thrones or Star Wars or something like that massive home run right but it is significantly more unknown and more risky than starting with the end in mind and going I see a problem I'm going to just build the solution and I'm gonna go solve that and so when I think about net worth number and this idea of like never having to work again what that means to me is shifting from I see the problem and I'm just going to use writing as the vehicle to solve it to I'm going to take much bigger swings longer term bets but I'm not making decisions from a place of this is going to make me money now it's more on the I would classify as the art side as opposed to the business side I like that way of framing it you know because I think you're kind of lying to yourself if you're like where a lot of writers go wrong I think is they much earlier in their careers you don't have the money part figured out you know you haven't really gotten your footing and you're like I'm gonna go pursue the art which is great but then at the same time they want the immediate external result and that's where things get hairy because you're picking one thing but your expectations are aligned with the other and so that's why like my kind of whole thesis especially in the world of writing is I actually think it's better to focus on the business side first learn how to monetize writing learn how to use it as a vehicle to solve people's problems answer people's questions learn business models learn audience building learn all the things you need build your foundation you know and then whatever that net worth number is for one person it might be 100K for another person might be a million for another person might be 10 million whatever like get your footing but then once you've gotten your footing and you're like I now have the skills to be able to take care of myself forever like I I have a insane amount of career defensibility because I know I can always wake up tomorrow and monetize my skills in a different way you know but the ultimate goal at least for me is kind of Shifting that pendulum from I'm writing with the primary goal of making money to I'm writing with the primary goal of creating new things that might make money I want to tell you about the moment meant that I felt really free to do whatever I wanted please because I think you'll appreciate this you know in June 2020 like pretty much I mean Peak covid covet had just started I bought a house in the woods one hour north of Montreal Canada and this it's actually in a small little town but it's it's it's basically in the woods and I walk into I walk into this open house and it's this beautiful house it's five bedrooms it's overlooking you know 80 acres of land and forests and rivers I walk outside and I like just smell that fresh air it's like combination of like meat trees and Pine and and just like it's on a lake so it's like that Lake air you're hearing like I was like I don't remember the last time I hear I've heard birds chirping you know like birds yeah I was like what what is this I saw like a little blue jay literal Blue Jay just like land on this tree and I was like I need to buy this house the graphics out here are amazing the crafting this is crazy Activision you've really outdone yourself yeah I was like waiting for the lag to happen and it just wasn't [Laughter] so I go back you know I I went to this open house for fun literally that's how it always goes yeah and I go to the real estate agent and I was like how much is the house and he goes it's 330 000 what Canadian oh my God so I go okay uh like here's put a bow on it I'll take it I'll tell you I'll take it I gotta call the next day he said sorry there's there's another offer on the table I'm like okay whatever I was like put in 375. so it's to me that felt like a fair offer uh-huh get a call back five minutes later the house is yours next day I go to the bank I get a suite 2.12 interest uh interest rate loan because boy remember the days the good old days and for basically a thousand dollars a month Canadian so just 750 a month I'm living in this crazy house and at that moment I said to myself I don't need any more money ever I could live in this house forever I could smell the beautiful smells I could get free education and free health care in this country could you imagine yeah wow I could walk to my my favorite coffee shop there's great you know great restaurants uh you know it takes me 50 minutes to get to the to an international airport they're skiing there's no there's all these things and it made me realize that all these years that I had spent in San Francisco and New York where I was spending tens of thousands of dollars a month on random stuff that it was really it was you know I moved to those places to get freedom and really I got enslaved by those places and the number one way to get more wealthy I think is to just lower what you want and once I started once I had that meant that mindset shift then all of a sudden I was being I was a better business person so I think I was just in the past okay when I look back at like all my Ventures that I've done Adventures where I actually like try to make a lot of money I actually don't make a lot of money and the ventures that I'm just following my curiosity and building tour towards my curiosity those tend to do better so for example in 2021 in the hip to crypto Mania we had an offer I don't think I publicly said this but we had an offer for we had a hundred someone willing to give us 100 million dollars to go build a studio incubator around web 3 startups oh my God even just hearing that I I just feel like there's a giant asterisk next to that 100 million dollar off uh number from a very very well-known group of people like top tier and I spoke to my co-founder about it and I was like should we do it should we not do it I was like I know what I want to do but I'm curious what you think and you know we started talking about it and I was like no no we can't we're not doing this we don't we don't need to do this we we have our path and we're going down our path and if I didn't if I wouldn't have bought this house I don't know if I would have made that decision something I have noticed I've been having a handful of these conversations with some entrepreneurial friends lately and something I wish people would share more isn't the things that they choose to do it's the things they choose to say no to because I think it's really hard to wrap your it was certainly hard for me to wrap my head around it like much earlier on I was just having a conversation with another buddy who was telling me he turned down a like one year strategic you know they wanted to hire him to be like CEO of this company just for a year to kind of like bring it attention help turn it around a little bit and they offered him like two million dollars to do it and he like thought about we were having lunch and he was he was like yeah you know I thought about it for a bit I talked to my wife about it and then I was like like I don't really need this in my life right now you know because you know when someone offers you two million dollars or someone offers you 100 million dollars like they're not just giving you that that there's a lot of strings that come with that and all of a sudden you have a boss and all of a sudden you have expectations right and and and the life that you've built for yourself sort of goes out the window I am really fascinated right now in these conversations and just talking to different successful people and hearing what they say no to and why like what was the real why did you turn down 100 million why didn't you take this seemingly cushy job because a lot of people look at that and they're like what how could you turn that down like that's my biggest dream but that's sort of it sort of circles back to what we're saying about venture-backed versus bootstrap you know versus the like what version of Entrepreneurship do you want to live and play what type of Life Do you want to build and yeah I've I've come to very much the same conclusion like I've had some wild offers in the past two years and I've said no to almost all of them because I'm like I really like the life I have right now you know give me an example give me an example I gave you an example of something that I've never shared probably to anyone public or private Beyond that's my co-founder so well I'm glad so now you're on the hook here's an easy one so in 2021 um kind of like right as Dickie and I Dickey was still working at BlackRock ship 30 was growing but I think we were still in a phase of uncertainty because you know I was still ghost riding on the side to pay my bills you know ship 30 was like making money but it was very lumpy and it was and it was very new and I think both Dickie and I were like is this gonna continue is this sustainable like should we bet on this and so Dicky was one foot in one foot out you know still at BlackRock I was one foot and one foot out still ghost riding on the side and I had three different um I was doing a bunch of like startup Consulting category design type strategy projects at the time and I had three different companies in 2021 I had a super early stage Tech startup found by not as mainstream known as like a Zucker and Elon but like that tier of person one of the most well-known Tech entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley um and was looking for help you know and not just like contractor was like we're looking for someone to like really come in and run with this second was like a mid mid-tier um like e-commerce company 100 million in sales you know same thing they're like we're big growth spurt like we're looking to hire somebody to like really run with this thing and the third was a publicly traded um company and so a it was cool to like get to see inside like three very different maturity maturities of business and in all three of them it sort of presented itself where I was like again one foot in one foot out was ship 30 and I was like there's a world where I could pursue one of these like and I was having conversations with the founders and and like it was sort of apparent that like the door was open like if I wanted something to happen I could walk through it I ended up not pursuing any of them and instead Dickie and I had a lot of conversations and were like you know what ship 30 is a little early but I went first I was like I'm gonna start ramping down my ghostwriting I'm gonna start focusing on ship 30 100 of the time I think in me doing that that gave Dicky the confidence to be like okay I'm gonna go all in too he ended up leaving BlackRock you know and a year later like ship 30 became more successful than anything we had either of us had experienced and it ended up being a lot more successful than I think what I would have made working for any of those companies but what was what's interesting though is and I and I bet you had a moment of this when the person comes and goes well we'll offer you 100 million dollars to to do this something I recognize is it's really not about the money it's actually more about the status it's more about the like you feeling chosen totally you know like you feel special that it was offered to you it's the status to yourself but it's also you know a lot of people I speak to so like I feel like in our world in in the cash flowing bootstrap world it's pretty low status oh dude when I when people ask what I do and I'm like yeah I run a writing program like you can see it in their eyes it's as if I just said I teach kindergarten like yeah I've even had people be like what and and how and how's that going are you are you having a good time like there's like condescending about it you know and I'm like okay like I like rich and Anonymous is okay with me you know like I I like that but you're totally like there is an almost there's very little status in the world that we're in whereas you if you're a founder of a VC backed company you could be paying yourself a salary of 80k a year be losing Millions a year and be on a trajectory to like work 80 hours a week for five years and your chances of success are five percent or less but when you talk to people people are they shower you with admiration it's especially low status being a Creator in our world like just calling at what it is like the amount of I see it sometimes because you know I recently been posting on Instagram I don't Instagram Instagram is a world unlike many others so you know recently I've I've been trying to grow my Instagram if you're listening to this just toss me a Pity follow Greg geisenberg also on YouTube please please like I'm trying to grow these subscribe buttons yeah like give me some amount of status folks so I'm posting I'm posting on Instagram and I'm like struggling to get any sort of traction and I've noticed that as people especially when I'm posting about myself there's a bunch of [ __ ] shares because I have a business account you can see who's sharing it and I know it's people sharing these like photos of myself or these stories that are just like gossiping and making fun of me whenever we get the metrics up totally so there's one way to look at that and be like that sucks right and it's probably the truth is it is probably a lot of people who I do respect for my like Silicon Valley days and stuff like that the other hand it's like I'm not trying to play that status game like Naval says it right Naval says what's his you know don't like playing status games is dumb basically yeah I've that had a big impact on me when I read that book which is one of my favorite business books actually what's it what's it called Almanac yeah the almanac um and uh there's a rapper I really like Russ who had a song recently that where he's like if you have to pick one go for the money don't go for the fame I think a lot of people as you start to build like one of two things happen either you start to build and you you know you start to get your footing and and things are going well and you either come to that realization and you're like oh status is way overrated like I would rather just make the things I want to make hopefully that they're lucrative and you know I have a life of financial abundance uh that's cool with me or other people really over rotate I notice and are like ooh status is addicting like Fame is addicting and then they go play a different game you know and they do the whole podcast circuit and they they it's like as much attention as possible and a cool concept Dickie and I've been talking about a lot is like and he'll be able to explain it better than me you should ask him but um this idea of how much revenue can you produce per unit of attention so the goal is not like like if you look at some creators that have hundreds of thousands or even millions of followers and then you do the the math of like what's their revenue relative to the units of attention that they're producing their ratio is really unimpressive you're like oh you're doing you know half a billion views a month but you're only doing 70 grand a month right like not a great not a great ratio I would rather my my attention be lower but my profitability per unit of attention be significantly higher I had this same this conversation with a friend of mine he has like 300 000 followers on Instagram maybe 500 000 on Tick Tock and he called me up and he was like I'm barely making any money I'm barely barely made I'm scraping by he's like what is your suggestion to get me out of this hole so my suggestion to him was to Niche down in a particular highly monetized sub niche of his you know what he talks about oh but you know I don't wanna I'm gonna alienate all the other people and I'm gonna who cares like it that's just like a mental game of him like he's attached to his 250 000 followers on Instagram or whatever yeah why just why my worst case scenario would be being recognized on the street and making or like and still having to work a full-time job or like making not very much and still just living in my studio apartment in Chicago like how horrible would that be you know it's like you're losing your personal life now you got people that are like hey it's you from Instagram or Tick Tock like and and you're getting recognized in public and now you have this weird dynamic that you have to live with but you're not even getting the financial upside like that's to me that's that's horrible like I would never want that and I get I mean maybe other people want different things and that's fine but yeah I especially if you're not proud of the work the worst case of that is you get recognized you're scraping by and the thing that you got recognized for is pretty like you're not proud of you know I I was at a wedding recently and I I I ran into you watch the office David Wallace you know what I'm talking about oh my God amazing okay so I actually I see David Wallace from the corner of my eye and I I asked someone I said is that David Wallace from the office looks exactly like him yeah it is so I go over them hey you know my name is Greg Eisenberg I'm a huge office fan like I watch it like every night you know before I go to bed every night before bed yep he's like you like the office I was like yeah he was like genuinely like so so stoked uh-huh he goes into his pocket he hands me a business card I pull I look at the business card it says David Wallace CFO Dunder Mifflin oh my God I was like you're literally my hero right now like you did a thing at this point 15 years ago but you're you're proud of the thing that you did yeah and all the respect to you I totally agree and that's a great way of putting it is it it depends on how you feel about it you know it's like it's like an artist who maybe doesn't make that much but they love their work and they love what they do and you know um but even still I still sort of circle back to if you're generating all that attention and you're not monetizing it something else is going on because it's not that you can't like the opportunity is there it's just either you have a skill deficiency like you haven't really learned or taken the time to understand how to monetize business models you know whatever or you have some sort of relation like weird unprocessed through relationship with money where you're like no I feel weird I don't want to monetize my craft if I monetize like that's selling out that's you know and whenever I talk to people like that it's very clear that like that's not true it's not like if if something makes money that doesn't mean that it's lower quality like that's not a factual statement but so many people have these faulty beliefs around money thinking I can't charge for that I don't want to charge for that if I do charge for that that means XYZ you know that means I'm taking advantage of people that means I'm selling out whatever and none of those things are true and so yeah I just look at it like why go through all this effort to generate all this attention hopefully it's because you're doing something you really enjoy and if you are doing that then invest a little bit of time in understanding how to monetize it in a way that you feel good about too so you get the other side of the barbell because otherwise like attention for attention's sake is really fleeting and you know doesn't really do anything for you a lot attention doesn't pay the bills you know there's a guy on Twitter JK Molina he says yeah likes like saying cash like saying cash he's right I'd take I'd take the cash over the likes any day well it sounds like you'll take the likes and the cash yeah you know but again I want the ratio yeah I want the cash per like to be as high as possible you know I it's not like it's all the the threads and the viral YouTube videos and ads it's all just like numbers for the sake of numbers and it's like what are what are you really doing here what are you really optimizing for you know there's an argument to be made that you need you need top of the funnel content that goes viral to get attention to then build a niche or audience what do you think of that when people say that no I mean ship 30 is a great example of how not true that is you know super Niche a lot of the things that we write around writing don't go crazy viral at all and I also think that a lot of creators have it backwards like it's not you build attention and then you build a business because if you build a ton of attention posting memes and then you try and go launch a business like it's it people aren't brain dead it's not like just because they followed you they're just gonna miraculously buy the thing that you sell you know and so it's not audience and then oh now I have something to sell it's like who's the person that you want to help build the thing that you know helps them and then go sell the mixtapes out of your car you know then go get attention for it yeah sometimes I see like these you know memes and and stuff like that online and that's cool if like you love sharing that stuff and you get enjoyment out of it but if you're trying to monetize it and it's like if you like this meme you'll also like my newsletter on you know and it's like that's literally the definition of being and switch by the way you know it's literally bait meme switch newsletter yeah like okay if you're actually like creating value add content to the conversation and then it's like if you like this check out my newsletter that's one thing yeah it's not it's not that complicated it's not that hard you don't have to people make it way harder than it needs to be you know ship 30 hit seven figures as a business with like four steps it was right on Twitter drive people to a free educational email course send them a Weekly Newsletter sharing here's more of what we know every couple newsletters join the next cohort of ship 30. like that is not that we're not talking about building a SAS platform here we're not talking about launching a cyber security firm you know like this is It's not that difficult and people make it to make it out to be so much more complicated than it needs to be it's like solve someone's problem give a lot of it away for free remind them of what you have to sell do it a lot that's it before we head out do you have a question for me when do you get back to Miami August 14th August 14th okay nice I'm going to grease for my bachelor party uh uh August 30th or something like right or maybe the week before so okay so I'll get to see you for like a week yeah so we'll hang out and then uh and then I'll dip out and then I'll come back what do you want to do I don't know I got you know I'm trying to do my rounds while I'm here in Miami I want to try as many awesome restaurants as I can so if you have any uh either that you've been wanting to try for a while or like a favorite I would love some wrecks and then let's go let's go try a new spot or something I'll take you for a night of fun oh no put on your seatbelt oh no actually you know what take off your seat belt yeah yeah we'll have a good time we're gonna live stream it on Instagram yeah follow along follow along follow along um Cole thank you so much for for like chat I could literally chat with you for for hours uh save so you're gonna have to you can come on whenever you'd like you you and dick you have a open invite uh for people who want to follow you and the ship 30 and PGA Journey where can they find you yeah Twitter you know all things Twitter but yeah I agree I I always love our our talks and I really appreciate that we've gotten to the begin the beginning of our friendship here in uh Miami but I really look forward to seeing you when you get back I mean I would love to find a way to work together I just don't know how it'll it'll reveal itself it always does yeah cool and I gotta ask you about should I write a book or not oh you know what's so funny you just said that literally yesterday I was thinking of texting you because someone else that I met at uh when Dicky and I went to that cab uh Cabo that Cabo Mastermind um I was just chatting with him and he's thinking about writing a book I was giving him some feedback stuff like that and then I thought of you because we had talked about the community book like six months or eight months ago or something and I was like I should Circle back and ask Greg if he's ever gonna do that because I think that would be a I mean totally man just keep dominating the category you know keep planting your flag and but why why okay why why should I have a tweet drafted actually about this it's not even a tweet it's a it's in a gem of an idea and it says I have no desire to write a book and it says write thousands of words a day and you get no easy way to get instantaneous feedback like what I like about Twitter and my sub stack is like I post something and I get instant feedback and what scares me about writing a book is I'm gonna go spend five months of my life like sahil Bloom I know is writing a book right now and he's spending so much of his energy like writing a book and it's like always thinking about and it's taking him like a year like is that gonna be me am I going to spend thousands of hours on this thing it just depends on what sort of book you want to write I I think you know he because I'm assuming he he got a uh like a publishing deal totally different it's like venture-backed versus bootstrap totally different set of expectations right his book needs to sell a million copies or it's failure right like VC you're either a billion dollar company or you're not and and I think I would encourage you not to do that I would encourage you to self-publish bootstrap and instead write a book that is basically think of think of a book as you're just doing it's it's well it's two things you're doing all of the work where you now have content to pull from for the next five years on this one topic and this idea of you wanting feedback you already got all all the feedback like you already know what you would say about Community I I know I know what I'd write about yeah so you don't I probably to be honest yeah you gave me really good advice once uh and I probably said the same thing like oh it's so much work I you're like dude it's literally 10 blog posts that's it yeah I know exactly what I would those 10 blog posts would be so this is the difference right is like you already and this is also the difference in like types of non-fiction I I'm about to publish my uh ghostwriting book it took me three months to write I didn't have to think about I already knew everything I was gonna say sahil or anyone that goes and gets a publishing deal or whatever like most of the time because the expectations are different there's a lot more research and they're figuring out what they want to say because they're trying to write something that you know they have a totally different goal you don't have that you already know everything you're going to say so you don't need like feedback on what like you already know what you would say and so now it's just a matter of taking the time to compress it and you have this asset and a book does a really good job of planting planting your flag in the ground and being like I own this category even if it's self published art and business of online writing self-published It's Made Me way more money than if I would have gotten a publishing deal for it and everyone in the online writing World references it I mean I would I think if I were to write a book I wouldn't even like my goal I really actually like Alex hermosi's approach which is charge as little as possible for the book and get it in yeah that's possible yeah it's not about the money it's about I wrote the book on this topic yeah I'm the guy all right I got a I got a Jad but could speak to you for forever so thank you again awesome later I'm excited when you get back yeah see ya see you bro

Understanding the essence of salesmanship grants us the leverage to steer conversations, garner support, and lead others toward shared visions.

there's two types of people in this world people who know they're in sales and people that are in denial at their own sales I learned early on in my career and well early on in my life that I really enjoyed convincing people of things and later on in life I learned that that's called sales so we all kind of just understand that we're all selling something even if it's an idea a restaurant recommendation whatever it is we're also in something if we just kind of get comfortable with that and we understand that that's a skill we might be able to have a little bit more of what we want and bring people along with us

There is both an art and a science to successful sales.

The science is well know. The more leads you start with, the more sales you will end up with.

But the art lies in narrowing the funnel's spread, so that you need to convert less leads to achieve more successful sales.

This is where having an experienced mentor can have a profound impact on honing your sales skills, propelling you years ahead.

Title: Increase Your Luck With Curiosity

The most underrated attribute for successful sales and entrepreneurship is curiosity.

Curiosity knows no bounds.

Curious individuals are not confined to specific domains; their inquisitive nature spills over into every part of their existence.

By nurturing a curious mindset, you expand your "luck surface area," opening doors to unexpected possibilities and serendipitous encounters.

You’ll experience more rejection and failure, but you’ll also experience more success and growth because of it

The number one skill that will get you far in the world of entrepreneurship: kindness.

You never know who is sat next to you.

During the flight back from Vegas, a fellow passenger, visibly exhausted, kept encroaching on my personal space.

It would have been easy to get annoyed, but that wouldn’t have achieved anything.

Instead I asked him if he was okay.

And now, because I led with kindness, I have a connection with the co-founder of Lyft.

my framework is to own what you can control in the process being able to know what you're opening with and know what you're moving towards next it's very simple but it's a lot of people have missed I think sales there's the art and there's the science people don't close if they think you need it more than they do you're going to drive value to the person who is saying yes and they can't get that value without what you're offering getting the job selling private jet store Warren Buffett was one of the hardest sales processing I ever went through I still believe that pressing flesh as we used to say shaking hands it matters Andy welcome to the show thanks for having me so I met you 12 or so years ago and you were my first introduction to like people in this world who have crazy stories before then I had just read about people like you and then you told me I think I said tell me a bit about yourself Andy and you said first I sold private jets I sold a company to Facebook and then what was after that after that was we sold ways to Google all right then I was like then I sold to come into Google and I was like who is this guy you're like in your early 30s yeah yeah yeah it was uh you know I learned early on in my career and well early on in my life that I was I really enjoyed convincing people of things and later on in life I learned that that's called sales uh and I think that there's two types of people in this world people who know their own sales and people that are in denial at their own selves and I think you know soon we all kind of just understand that we're all selling something even if it's an idea a restaurant recommendation whatever it is we're also in something if we're just gonna get comfortable with that and we understand that that's a skill we might be able to have a little bit more of what we want and bring do people along with us so how do you get good at sales like if if sales is important and we all could use it as a secret weapon is there a framework for being a pro at sales yeah there are a lot of Frameworks um my Tick Tock algorithm shows me a lot of different people telling me their framework for sales uh my framework is to own what you can control in the in the process that there's so much in a process of convincing somebody of something or committing them to join your team or buy your product or take your ideas is worth another piece of the conversation to just own the part of it that you can control so my first job out of college was selling life insurance and I have to tell you that life insurance is one of the least sexy things you can possibly sell because the opening part of the conversation begins have you recently thought about your death and then you'd have to recover from that and I ended up being the number one life insurance salesman in America in in the rookie class when I was 23 years old because I learned how to own what I could control and the only thing that I can control in the process was it wasn't who said yes because one out of three people would say yes so there's two people that I had no control over their nose and to get to three pitches I had to start with 10 leads there were seven people who were leads that were not gonna ever let me pitch and so I said I want X number of sales so I multiplied the number of pitches I needed to do by three and I multiplied that number by 10 to get how many leads I needed to get and every week I just went out and made sure I got that many new pens that would turn into threes which would turn into ones because I didn't control who who would say yes I didn't control who would let me Pitch I just controlled making that the reach out to the people in there and for different parts of our Lives we're going to go through different amounts of 10 threes and ones um in dating you know you gotta kiss a lot of frogs sometimes to find the person who you want to spend a little bit more time with to in your case find the person you want to spend the rest of your life with Congratulations by the way and and it's a process right but there were it's not everything's a funnel it doesn't have to be unsexy but it does break down to you know number of people we spoke to a number of people we spent time with so remember the one person that we wanted to actually send a life not everything's a funnel but everything's a funnel yes and so I think that that getting good at fails getting good at being persuasive getting good at bringing people along with you on a journey is figuring out which part of that process you're in control of and then knowing what the next step is after that after the part that you're in control of right so in sales it's you make a pitch or you make a presentation in recruiting it's you can put together an offer in dating it's the ask for the next date be able to know what you're oh like what you're opening with and know what you're moving towards next is what a lot of people it's very simple but it's what a lot of people have missed I've been on sales calls uh you know a lot of sales calls where I've had people say so what do you think and I said sounds like an amazing opportunity and they said okay great well uh thanks so much for your time I was like you haven't I haven't said yes yet I just paid you a compliment like you have to ask for the business and that's what separates you have to ask for the next step and that's what separates people who have dabbled with the skill of sales from people who haven't really perfected it when I was a teenager I I realized the importance of sales you know I don't know I was a weird teenager I guess and I was selling agency services at the time my top of the funnel was I'd add people on LinkedIn I'd get their email address and then I'd basically say hey like I looked at your website kind of sucks I can make it better here's how I would do it I basically this is like pre-calibly and stuff like that I'd say here's my phone number call me anytime like the access like just here's my phone number call me anytime I realized I was closing no one basically on these phone calls um maybe it was my pre-pubescent voice um or maybe it just I just I couldn't get my story tied enough so I found this guy who he was 31 32 at the time he had built a big agency and I I basically said hey would you be willing to sit on 5 or 10 or 15 of my calls yep write notes and tell me all the things I'm doing poorly and he did that for eight nine ten calls gave me notes paid him for his time okay those sets of notes like for me like changed the whole uh course of my life right um what do you think about that what do you think about people giving you notes on sales calls like is it you know yeah what do you think yeah I think sales there's the art and there's the science right the science is you know the law of large numbers you know ten three to one right the art is making it you know five three to one right so instead of having 10 leads I get to three pensions to get you one right being able to reduce the spread of the the reduced of the the magnitude of the funnel is the the arch that happens and that's where a mentor can be just years ahead of what uh you'd be able to figure out on your own you will figure it out on your own like everybody he didn't figure it out I don't know anything good enough at that but if you can you know wisely get somebody to give you that give you notes and say hey here's what I heard you say and here's what you could have said hey you get really excited when they start to agree with you and you you're almost like that guy at the bar that needs to get laid and like they're like oh my gosh he really needs the sale like people don't close if they think you need it more than they do right if it's your agenda versus theirs they're like oh this is this is not going to be good for me you know what but if if you look like you've done this a million times just a part of the process this is what we do next you kind of guide them through those steps those are the types of notes that uh somebody who's done this a lot can give you and maybe speed up your clothes your clothes ratio and and the art side of your your sales is there a difference between selling a ten thousand dollar website or a one billion dollar app to Google for example what what use when you sold ways to Google the fundamentals are almost the same you're going to drive value to the person who is saying yes and they can't get that value without what you're offering if that's the way that you frame it right that you know what I you know raised over 100 million dollars of venture funding for companies I've been a part of companies I've raised over 100 million and then now the coach you know getting close to a billion of funding that's come into companies that I have been a part of in some way shape or form all of that when positioned as an opportunity for somebody to participate in the upside to go on the journey to be on the rocket ship is the same as me starting off my career selling lawn mowing services in Dallas Texas there's something that I was offering to do that this person either did it want to or couldn't do themselves and I had built the infrastructure of the company the the offering that they were excited about and they said you know what for the time that I'm going to get back you'll own my lawn versus me really well like that's worth 20 bucks sure and if you can kind of break it down on the value exchange and you kind of come at people as I have something and you have something I have the thing you want you okay I want you have money I have Services should we bring those two two together do we both feel good about this fantastic let's move on um that is what most of the negotiations that I've ever been a part of that moved forward that was the the spirit or the feeling that was in the room was everybody was getting what they wanted and they were willing to part with what they had do you remember a particular time where it was like one of the hardest negotiations of your life or one of the hardest sales of your life and it just sticks in your brain as like uh a marquee Marquee moment getting the job selling private jets for Warren Buffett was one of the hardest sales processing I ever went through because the guys that ran the company were literally the 40 best sales guys in America and so to convince a sales guy to let you be a sales guy with them is a really arduous process because they like you're the guy who gave you notes was that was very nice of him these guys are not giving me notes after retention interview right uh they're not being kind until once I got on the team awesome best people in the world right A lot of people uh know Jesse itzler right Jesse was my boss yeah you know when I was selling private jets and like watching him operate up close and in person was like incredible and the whole team at Marcy jet back 2006 to 2009 was like Jesse and baby Jesse's right and and like you get to be a part of that crew for a few years and like run the Texas sales region for Warren Buffett's private jet company was absolutely what I wanted to do but I think it took me three three tries uh to get in there and to like show them how hard I was willing to work which other than you know they said we only hire people almost 15 years in sales experience and I said well I started my lawnmower company once well 26 now so like I'm just one year shy they're like no that doesn't count but they ended up hiring me when I was 28. but you know being able to be one of the youngest guys on the team was totally worth all the effort that I put into it and all the you know I'm going to be in New York for meetings and I just flew and hung out had their office and waited until like I could get through the phone be like hey I'm actually nearby can I swing by to continue the conversation that we were having I set my business plan to five different hotels in San Francisco knowing that the CEO is going to be in San Francisco I knew we'd only stay at one in five hotels and he called me he goes how did you get this into my room those were the types of things that I was trying to do to show them like like I'll do this to get the job imagine what I will do the way I one of the ways I got I got to know you actually was you were throwing a dinner called the good people dinner good good people great dinner I was living in Montreal at the time and you like sent an email uh you're like yeah I'm having a dinner tomorrow or something you should come by and I remember looking you know I was in college at the time and I remember looking at flights and it was like for whatever reason it was like I don't know two thousand dollars or super expensive and I was like ah you know a part of me is like I shouldn't do this but I take out my credit card I swipe it I show up to the dinner and I end up like from that dinner I met you which has been super fruitful but also met like a bunch of like lifelong friends yeah um from that dinner so I feel like one of the biggest hacks to when I look back at my career one of the biggest hacks is just being like yeah I'm in town totally like get on the plane like that's one of the biggest sales hacks it's just just being okay to get on a plane and and acknowledging that it's a funnel like not every dinner is going to be amazing and not every meeting is going to work but you have to be willing to to get on a plane yeah I I am in London right now I got here this morning I knew that this you know this call was still scheduled I mentioned my flights were around us to have this conversation and there was a meeting that last week I found out about and they're like do you want to zoom or or are you guys based in London or where I was like oh I'm actually gonna be a little next week because you don't get the opportunity that I had this morning to meet with the person I met with in person and I still believe that pressing flesh as we used to say shaking hands like it matters there's certain there's certain times when it matters and there are certain things that will will happen in a room that you just can't pick up on a zoom and it's not everything I'm I'm very grateful to not be challenged 200 days a year like I used to but there there is a threshold that I will hop on a plane and I'll be back in New York you know in a couple days but totally worth it to help across the pond for the meeting I had this morning and another one tomorrow I think they're I think there's a story with you and I want to say someone at Coca-Cola or Delta and you missed a flight do you know what I'm talking about I do I do yeah I I was uh speaking at MIT I had been invited to join this panel and it was in a panel of academics and I'm you know a homeschool kid from Texas that got a finance degree from Texas A M and these are like double IVs right everybody's intellectually like they're they're the ones who should be speaking at MIT and I did a lot of prep work for this panel I knew everything about all their businesses and I but I wanted you know I wanted it to be friendly and cordial but I love panels where you can disagree just just enough to to spark a conversation and so I did that on a couple points that I thought you know this is this for the audience would be great I mean you know I'm rushing back to New York and I hear behind me hey brilliant really enjoyed what you shared today and you know a gentleman who I had not seen before the auditorium and so as we're like literally repacking our bags after having weapon GSA I was like hey by the way my name is uh I was I was like you know what were we up before he goes oh I just got hired as the new head of digital for Coca-Cola and I'm trying to learn as fast as I can I'm working for a startup that would very much like to be involved with Coca-Cola at the time and I said I said oh you know what what stood out to you from today so he starts to talk and we're kind of walking together towards the gate and I'm not late for my flight but I'm pretty close to late like boarding is happening pretty soon and I say would you like to get a beer and he goes oh yeah you know I'm here actually early so you know sure and so we're sitting at the Pug or you know uh Boston bar the Boston airport bar and I can hear them paging my name passenger Elwood last fall pass and I say you want another round and I know that I'm missing my flight but I'm keeping my poker face as polymer collected as I can and so we have a couple beers we call them two ideas and I said hey when I get back to New York tomorrow I'm going to follow up with you on both those ideas you know does that sound like a a great next step for us you know this is really productive conversation he said absolutely thanks so much for for the beers when he walks through his game catches this fight makes it home to The Stairway to Atlanta and I end up booking like the 11 p.m puddle jump you know that and sit middle seat which I'm not a middle seed type guy and but that got that connection and was able to do one of those ideas that with Coca-Cola and my favorite part is that I later hired him to be the CMO of my last startup and it was his way five years later six years later to leave Coca-Cola he served his time he done what he wants to do at Coca-Cola and he you know he came in and you know was CMO for a little bit and then said hey you know startup life really isn't for me but he lost his own agency and now it's one of the most successful digital agencies uh between digital agency in Atlanta and all because I just was willing to miss a flight and buy buy a couple beers and you never know who you're gonna sit next to in life right yeah and so let me tell you a story like that so I'm flying home from Vegas CES um when I was living in San Francisco to Las Vegas to San Francisco back row middle seat and I have this guy next to me who is like keeps like basically sleeping on me you know he's just like going on my chair and I'm kind of like light lighting lightly moving him to my right coming on my chair you know it's Vegas right he's he's he was probably up for 32 hours let's say yeah yeah I you know I didn't know who I was sitting next to right so I I and I'm a positive guy and I anyways I started talking to him I was like Hey like are you okay like you've been kind of like coming in my seat so oh I'm so tired I had such a bit busy CES we start talking turns out he's a co-founder of Lyft wow and yeah he's a co-founder of Lyft and we get talking and he's like you know telling me he's just oh I'm so tired but I'm excited to play tennis when I get back I was like oh we should play tennis sometime and all of a sudden I have this relationship with the co-founder of a multi-billion dollar company who like to this day like I have that relationship with yes and the lesson really for me was always lead with kindness and positivity and you never know who's sitting next to you 100 in situations like that what's you know when you lead with kindness and positivity how do you know to continue it right like how how long did it take for you to get to he's the co-founder of Lyft because he didn't probably lead with that only at the end of the flight did he tell me he was the co-founder of Lyft so only after we had talked about tennis like I was playing tennis with him even before I knew he was the co-pounder of left wow right yeah sure yeah um because we had we were talking about tennis and but there was something inside me that was like there's something interesting about this guy yeah um and there's something that I was just following my curiosity like I I really I'm sure you feel you feel this a lot of the time when you meet someone and you kind of just sense that like oh there's something to this person and you you can't put your finger on it I had that same feeling with him and as we're getting up as we're getting up uh off the plane he's like oh by the way you're in Tech right I was like yeah he goes I think you might know him with a company that I started wow uh and he's like it's left wow I have always admired your curiosity and you're willing to test things um you know I followed you into the you know the one million follower yeah Challenge on Tick Tock um and I I just crossed over 500 followers last week so yeah didn't quite make it either um you know but what what where did where does curiosity show up the most for you I think curious people are curious everywhere like it isn't something that is siled into relationships or you know just when you go out to you know I just got I just grabbed the coffee right before this at the coffee shop and like started talking to the Barista about real estate in this particular town that I'm in like I just feel like Curious people are curious people I've learned that when you're curious it increases your you know what people call the luck surface area like you become more lucky if if you're curious that being said you also get burned and rejected 100 times more when you're when you're curious right so like you have to be okay with being burnt and I have plenty of examples of like yeah I was curious and I got rejected or burnt and it sucked right it sounds like curiosity came first but then a an ability to deal with rejection came second yeah I think I don't know I was always taught like to go out and in the you know for my parents and grandparents to go to go out in the world and be okay with rejection so as a as a child I was just like okay rejection is a part of life right like it just it it is and if you're not getting rejected then you're not doing life properly just like if you're not breathing you know something is wrong if you believe that rejection is a part of life then the next step is okay well I want to be curious about the world around me and I'm gonna go try a bunch of different things and then I just learned that like the coolest people on this planet are the most curious people on this planet and have collected the most interesting experiences like you and that's what drew me to you what drew me to you is you told me about stories and and experiences that at that point I had only read about in in books and I don't believe you can be an interesting person if you're not curious I completely agree with that and and I think that dealing with rejection and curiosity I I find are just they just go hand in hand with my favorite people and I think that I I actually if I you know if I were to drill back you know because I don't know about you but I I've recently moved on from some friendships and relationships that you know not because they're a bad person but they just they just stop that like actually the way I broke it down was they just stopped being curious and they just kind of said no I understand the world now right and like and and that like that was it like they're like this is as far as I go and I'm like well I'm still I'm still going and they're like but dude why are we hanging out anywhere else I was like because we're talking about the exact same thing that we're talking about like six months ago like like what what's new in your world I'm still still just frustrated about that thing that happened like I'm frustrated about anything to happen yesterday but not that thing um and I'm curious if if because you're you're kind of at the spot you know in in your professional world where people who come along and people who have said I'm good and I'm curious if that's true for you the way it has one for me so I've actually had a lot of epiphanies around friendships since covid um and even a little bit before kovid and I'll give you them so one of them and I actually have a note in my iPhone I'm gonna pull it up 2019 I felt like I can walk around San Francisco and I knew everyone people would like wave to me and I knew all the cool restaurants and the bars they let me in and I just like I really felt that I I'd come here years before and I gotten to know what you know people there yeah and I almost like I had the key to the city and one day I realized and it's when I wrote this note I said SF the city where everyone knows you everyone knows you but it's the loneliest City on the planet wow and the reason I had that Epiphany is you know I think it's I think Eric Clapton covered this song called nobody knows you when you're down and out and I don't know the original songwriter but the basic idea is that like as soon as you're not cool in San Francisco for whatever reason your quote unquote friends all of a sudden disappear your company runs out of cash and you have to close down you're you know something something happens you're you're doing crypto and it's no longer cool you're doing AI when it's no longer cool right like for whatever reason you're out of favor watch how these people that you met in a place like San Francisco um like how often they're gonna text you so that was one big Epiphany that was that the people that I considered professional friends a lot of them were were merely there just because they're climbing their own ladders um and the second thing I I I heard somebody say people don't want to be a part of the process they want to be a part of the outcome right totally totally and then the second thing is at Cove during covid I actually reconnected with my old like high school and grade school friends and I started this like group chat with like a bunch of them they haven't sold companies for a billion dollars to Google they are just regular people um with no audiences never started a company never sold a company you know read about Venture Capital maybe but don't know really what it is and just out of our world and I realize that those people like salted the Earth people like that they don't care like if I sell a company or I have a million followers or don't they just like they just like me for whatever reason um so that was a big Epiphany around friendship that was number two has that continued post-tandemic yeah yeah awesome I would say like I have like two groups of friends now I basically like have a smaller group of professional friends that are the people that might have been in SF but were actually my friends so I've trimmed that down from I don't know a big number to to five and I trimmed like and then I have this new like well new slash old group of friends that I've rekindled you've built so many communities quickly what part of those two truths right about the the San Francisco friends and the old friends informs the way that you think about the new communities that you're building there well I think uh some of the communities that we build the quickest end up following the quickest with respect to communities when you build a community really quickly you should actually be really cautious like great communities are aren't built quickly they're built over slowly over time and compounded yeah so that's that's the biggest lesson there is that like I'd rather Community grow 10 to 20 a month not 200 or 2 000 a month right and I just think that that's just a more sustainable way to grow a community and that's why I think I'm not a huge fan of venture capital and like Venture funding communities because I think what Venture is is I want to grow this as quick as possible but the greatest communities you know it's oil and water with that there's a a psychologist from the 70s and 80s a comedian psychologists named Scott Peck and he's written a handful of books but in one of his books um The Road Less Traveled he talks about the four stages of community and he breaks them down into Studio Community chaos anger and true community the pseudo Community is we both have this thing that we like in common we both like AI we're in a community together hey like awesome Community for people they're like yeah and then you start to get to know people in the community and you're like wait a second you disagree with me about like all like a lot of other stuff and then you go into chaos there's like a chaos moment in the community like slaughtering a big Community we're like we don't actually agree on everything like but like like this happens with like sports fans or people that you went to class with like the thing that brought you together is no longer the only reason that you spend time together and they're like man I totally voted differently than these people but we bought like AI what am I supposed to do and then you go through like anger and like despair like I don't I don't wasn't even real like did any of it matter but if you can go through that and be like yeah but you know what I still pick them I still want them to be in my world like yeah we disagree with about 70 of things but the 30 of things that we agree on super great like that's where our friendship is built that's where our relationship is built that's where our community is built and that's the that's what we're going to focus on that's the true Community not where everybody agrees about everything but there's a guiding set of principles that say Hey the core Basics we're all in on that piece it doesn't have to be it doesn't have to be the original thing that brought you together but like the way that we're operating is we're operating as you know a curious Community that's the community we're operating we just want to keep learning Collective knowledge what does that look like you know the topic we all showed up for originally was crypto we moved on to AI whatever but we're still learning together and we're making each other better as a true Community but most people quit somewhere in between chaos and despair you said something you asked a really interesting question when I was talking about the Lyft co-founder you said when did you know that he was the Lyft co-founder yeah which is a really astute question and a lot it relates to this because when you're meeting people within the professional context and you and you know what they're doing right away it's very hard to build long-lasting community because you might be you know being friends with someone because they're the CMO of Nike or something like that I want to tell you a story about last week I'm not a particularly a religious person but I went to a religious event and the leader of this uh Community was like Hey like I've never seen you here um would you like to have dinner with my wife and myself and a few other friends who are in from out of town I said I'm a curious guy right I'm like sure so I show up it's a four-hour dinner not once did anyone at the table ask me what I do it was just not at all there wasn't even it didn't even pop into it and by the end of this meal like I felt like these were my brothers and sisters so I think there's a lot that we can learn about Community Building from from religion I grew up a very religious person and have had a a Wandering Journey somebody called a prodigal son journey of my own where I was like I was like okay yeah I I understand all that now like I I know how to win at church I'll see you later and I kind of peace out for for a while well I'm saying I peace out for a while because that's just like every single person I knew growing up believed the exact same things that I believed and totally and they truthfully a lot of them still do um and and so when I go home you know they similarly you know to your your friends at home don't really know what I do um don't really understand a lot of those conversations but they do ask a lot like which church are you going to in New York right like it's the thing that they know to act and I'm not really that great great of friends with a lot of those people anymore but in thinking about communities that are not built around what can I get out of this but what can I give to this right which is what I think at its at its Pinnacle at its best is what religious communities that I've had the opportunity to observe exhibit I think there's a there's a chance for religion 3.0 if I'm if I go through my Rolodex and Founders the number of Founders that I know who grew up with some amount of religion in their life pretty high like it's it's north of 70 like they grew up believing in something that they couldn't see and so they're pretty comfortable being the startup founder because they're believing in something they can't see I did this this idea of state is not weird to them they're like hey I spent my entire high school going to the youth group on Sunday nights talking about things that I've never seen and but maybe like it made me feel something so cool and they pursued other things in their life that take some faith but I think that so there were so many Bad actors and so many I don't say scandals but so many reasons to like walk away from organized religion that people just like baby with the bathwater throw the whole thing out good bad and definitely the ugly and we just all went internal to work on ourselves in the past 20 years 25 years has just been you know the spirituality of you what are what like what are you you are the god inside of yourself and what I'm seeing in a lot of conversations I'm having is people looking to be part of something bigger than themselves that will Outlast them and they're realizing it's not it's not their startup and it's at their newsletter and they thought you know whatever thing that they're working on right now they know it probably won't Outlast them and it's definitely is not a global worldwide thing right the chances of doing that you know we all believe Silicon Valley or uh we all believed to The Social Network and we're like oh my God it was not gonna do it I can definitely do it like I'm much more well smoking than Mega list give us joy and communities that are more about giving I think you're going to have a really big rise in popularity I mean I think that's why burning men took off like look at the popularity of Burning Man like 20 like 20 years ago versus today and it's just gotten bigger and bigger have you been to burning man I've been one time and like describe what your Burning Man experience was and why it's a great example of community yeah but I'll just describe it and explain why I'm going back this year yeah okay yeah exactly so I had I had been invited to go quite a few times and the idea of truthfully taking that much time to be literally Off the Grid right because cell phones don't work there and there's no money there and everything's a barber system and there's not really like hours in a day there's what do you feel like doing like do I sleep you should sleep if you want to stay up all night you can sleep all night you know I watched the sunrise eight days in a row the last two times I had not gone to sleep in between like I just I just watched yeah they call it the double sunrise and like sober like I wasn't you know I was not enhancing myself to you know make sure that I stayed up again I just was like I finally clicked and so I I was you know I I had two friends that were my sponsors they said hey yeah we're gonna help you with all you know it takes a little bit to figure out how to get there and what you need to packing and then they just kind of like got me there and we're we're friendly for the first day and they're like all right go experience it and I and to talk about place where you can be curious because everybody there is just faciled by everybody else there um and you know a city of 80 000 people pops up in less than two weeks and disappears in less than two weeks and in the process you have everything that you need if you fully Trend and fully there and no one knew what my name was my my fire name they call it the Playa my Playa name was boots they had no idea what I did outside of Burning Man they didn't know my real name didn't know what my couple was anywhere truly where I lived I was just a guy named gootz who was there for some music there to play some games need some food post a happy hour whatever it was ride our bikes the third day that I was there I went to one of my friends and and this guy had been like 10 times 12 times after three days I was like okay so I've had enough um what do we do for like the next five days like I get it I get it but like I don't want to do this for another five days and he said he said Andy do you have a handful of friends here I was like yeah he was do you have more than a handful of friends here I was like yeah he goes do they come multiple times I was like yeah he goes is it possible that in three days you have not yet discovered what Dave discovered that makes them want to come back every year and I was like so three days is not is it enough to understand Burning Man what and and that that motor was just a pivotal don't look for me though I was like be more curious what am I not seeing and so I started going off by myself more often I started introducing myself to people who I didn't know and had no idea you know I had just sort of been Uber curious and day four and a half like if I could have I just would have stayed for another three weeks because I started to unlock the spirit of curiosity of and it's just you're like it's like you're on another planet and everything else just kind of Fades away and there are people who definitely cancer experience and people who you know that's what they're there for um but I think I think that overall Burning Man in my experience gets a bad rap for that um that there's it you know you're high but it's not on a Supply right you're high on just this experience and like you know they call you know when you leave bring them in they call going back to the default world right because like you kind of you you logged in you found this place and then you disappear you know back into the default world and for for a lot of people it is a version of a religion that that neither once a year they need that fixed yeah I wonder what I don't like about it is it's once a year it's a pilgrimage to Mecca but it's you go back to your life and then you get back into your routines like I wonder how you can incorporate like that same lessons in in your you know in your everyday life it sounds like you are doing a bit of it but it feels like a lot of people I know who go to Burning Man are just like they go they have a great time and then they leave yeah on on my final day when we were cleaning up camp I said to you know a new friend of mine I said to her I said I have so many things I want to do when I get back what am I supposed to do with this feeling of like I got Clarity on me a decent amount of things because I was out around those things I was completely detached from any interaction with with those things with those projects with those people and I said and she she said write it all down as explicitly as you possibly can and then wait 30 days and if you still want to do any of those things do it on the 31st day and it was such a it was such great advice because it just it allowed the the experiences I had to metastasize into wisdom into ideas into action but it wasn't like oh my gosh I just heard this quote I'm gonna go tell the whole world oh my gosh I just had this experience of like I'm moving I'm moving to Switzerland like no it was oh yes I know it like what my urge is I was able to kind of sit with it and say like what it what actually is that and in that next 30 days I ended a 14-year friendship uh logged out of a company that I was considering spending more time investigating myself I said you know that's not I like it but I don't love it I decided to marry my girlfriend um which I did you know four years later uh like like I made a lot of decisions coming off of that like being logged out state and and it wasn't because of Burning Man and I told you know you or your audience or anybody to like you have to go but for me it was what you said it was a version of you know love as a service right a version of community at its best um that you know I just and I saw I saw a different side of people in those moments I'm wondering if that's something that you should be doing monthly weekly quarterly how do you think about that so I have I have a pretty active journaling practice and for me the act of slowing down long enough to the right well I'm thinking forces my brain out of its normal routines and it's not the full burning experience obviously right yeah but but it but it it for it for me forces me to think differently because I'm slowing down long enough to actually choose the words and put them on a page I I don't you know a lot of people oh there's so many cool journaling apps and there are there's you know if if that's your thing like just Journal like that's the most important thing but like for me it's slowing down to actually pen to paper you know seeing each letter as it comes out I take yeah as long as it takes you know to fill the page and that for me is a little bit of logging out because I'm choosing what is worthy of making a paper and I don't write for a certain duration I don't care how many pages I write you know yesterday morning I wrote two sentences that was it that's all I needed but I had a place for the thought at a place for like hey let that sit there outside of my head and let it be something that might turn into something it might not and you know I haven't kind of a graveyard of projects and a graveyard of blog posts a graveyard of newsletter headline that like I wrote them down okay I know why I thought that was good now that's outside of my head it's not as good as a hell of us but sometimes it takes externalizing those thoughts and for me to paper um for me to really get clarity on like all right it sounded clever to me when it was around my head but that's not actually the thing but but maybe it's by you know by getting out of my head I open up a little space for the thing to to slot in right there's a little more space you know I I thank you for your advice and you know it's been super fun for me watching my YouTube channel four months ago and you know I'm I think one of my videos is about to cross 100 views so you know cool but like the process of making these videos every week the process of having that content out there has I've never written more I've never had more ideas than I do right now because of just taking things that had been sitting and I externalize them and now they exist in the world and if somebody wants to know what I think about things there's a lot of stuff out there in the newsletter and on the YouTube channel and I'm doing it and it's just it's it's as close to therapy as I've experienced by just creating and I'm getting to know myself better in the process so I don't do any journaling although I do have like a note folder ideas folder and stuff like that if I wanted to get into journaling tomorrow let's say every morning to me staring at a blank page is a bit overwhelming like what advice do you have to someone who is afraid of the blank page I think it's the number one reason people don't Journal is is a friend of the white page or they don't value they've not strugged to dial you to their own thoughts the second one is like a bigger problem it's like yeah no like every your thoughts are valuable period like yeah no and and and and I've seen people unlock that belief in themselves through journaling but but it was the reason that they didn't to start and so to start one of the things that I I've done and still from time to time do is you know my full name is Andrew Thomas right and I have Andrew Thomas Elwood write Andy a note as if she was in these executive coach dear Andy here's what I observed this week here's the things that it seems like you're spending a lot of time on here's the question that I'd love to see how you would answer and just and you it doesn't have to be you know writing the letters to yourself like you could think about dear future biographer this week was really interesting for me well here's why um the book titanium uh is is I think you know one of the best buyers business buyer pays out there uh it's still the latch attends of John D Rockefeller well the Rockefeller Foundation gave the author two years full access to John D rocker colors journals and so this book is unreal because it's it's literally pulled from the journals and it doesn't have to be that she takes anything around a biography about you but you're capturing those moments and it's like how would I explain that critical thing that happened recently like I've here's the story I told my friends but what's the story that I would tell my future self that was going back and saying like what was going on in 2023 wait that's what I thought happened interesting um you know and and so I have I'm on Journal number 20 uh in the series that I'm on and you know I everything that's happened since my first startup to now is in those 20 journals my last company Islands one of our investors was the co-founder of 24 Hour Fitness they basically invented actually not basically they invented gems like membership gyms uh in their early 80s I went to go visit the co-founder I just give him an update about you know we had this acquisition offer from Facebook and I was so excited and I asked him and I said what's your biggest regret in your career and he goes my biggest regret is just not writing it all down daily and I was like I said the same thing I was like yeah but like I just don't know I just I hate staring at a blank page I don't know what I'd write down and he starts laughing and he goes this story about going to Facebook and like getting an offer is insane this is obviously not gonna happen every day but even in your you know that's a big moment even in your little moments of you're going to the coffee shop and you have a conversation with the Barista that itself is an interesting potential story journaling to me sounds like I I just personally like have to get past I just have to do it I just have to like I feel like for me buy a buy a journal that I look for buy a pen and buy a journal uh that I'm excited to open and use I talked I talked about this I actually tweeted about this the other day where I want to double down on my YouTube so I went and bought like the dopest YouTube camera equipment Studio that sort of thing and now I'm on the hook to record so I think the question is how do you put yourself to be on the hook for journaling because it's it's it's it's your accountability is to yourself because it's a personal thing I forget whose quote it is but uh something along the lines of you wait until you're motivated how cute action begets action real winners just do it and then they they start to feel motivated as they go and and I think that if you just started and you said you know similar to you know the thought of 24 Hour Fitness so much of what you know like the reason the reason I show up every Tuesday and Friday for my boxing workout is not because I actually enjoy working out I really don't but I pay my trainer one to train me but more basically just to make sure I'm there it's like a babysitter inside a little bit yeah and I think that if you if you said I want to get into journaling and you reach out to you know your inner circle or some of your high school friends and said hey for the next 30 days would you be willing to to text me you know if you journal and I'll text you if I journal and just you know you just start there and say I'm as long as I write one sentence that's it one sentence every day that counts right yeah like for some some there's a personal trainer tells the story that when he's working with people who it's really their first time in the gym you just asked some of the first day to show up they have a conversation and then they go stand on the treadmill I'm gonna turn it on he goes okay that's enough for today see you tomorrow and they're like well wait where's the world no no that was it I want you to show up tomorrow we'll do we'll do more tomorrow right and they get they they have the conversation standing on the treadmill when they walk for one minute right and I mean you can use yourself if you said hey over there 30 days I'm gonna do one more sentence per day so okay well I'm gonna write one sentence they tell me right two sentences day three I'm gonna write give me someone said you would start to realize oh but wait I had more to say than just two sentences and it happens pretty quickly right the kind of flexing that muscle um you know not not to not to plug but I put your other 30 days of journaling prompts which are free on the website um maybe we can go there and download them and say what um and you know I've had a lot of fun you know with the responses that people have come up with um to you know they've told me hey you know day 17 that was my favorite yeah thanks so much for sending that to me um but because I really it is for me I feel like it's a superpower so it's a hack for my life you know I don't go anywhere without my journal in my backpack um and and it's you know something that I've always had you know close by because I'm you know and you know and I doodle at it I take meaning media notes in it I write full Journal journal entries in it like it's all in one place but it's just kind of the evolution of my brain as I go and I you know I use a bunch of the notes apps and notion and the notes app on my phone and like all that too but those are like for specific things that I want to be thinking about you know my journal is just a flow of Consciousness most of the time two business ideas one is an an online journaling you know product that is kind of like social by nature in the sense that like every day once you press publish it tells like your friend so Andy or whoever you've published so you stay accountable as a group and then the other business idea is just like I you know would I pay 99 a month or whatever a couple hundred bucks a month just for the text from you know Andy or someone like Andy being like did you write in your Journal today um yeah I love that but I think that what you're tapping into and this is something that I have I have journaled about this I have written this down on more than one occasion in a journaling truthfully is is a good jump off point but look you know I think it expands to learning in general right is a accountability as a student so I was homeschooled um from sixth grade all the way through uh High School graduation and so my mom would give me my assignments on the first of the month and then it was up to me to just get myself done like that and and I did not and you know I was the eldest child I've never you know I didn't have friends who you know I had a lot of homeschool friends and when I got to college people were like oh my gosh like she did he didn't check to see if we did our homework I was just like what do you need to check like what are you talking about like you just like hit with the sign you just do it but like you did it how'd you do it I was like is it like he said and I realized that like time management and just taking like personal responsibility to get the thing done was unique to the way that I started learning in high school and so college that part of college was not challenging for me well I realized in The more I've thought about like our traditional education system and when I was seeing every single go online right like right now there's no reason to go if you know what you want to be winning graduate because all of it is online for free and you can just start being the thing like quickly but the accountability to actually do it is the reason people don't accountability and social aspect right yeah like yep yeah but but I think but I think that actually like you can get the social aspect by doing the thing yeah right and talking about it publicly right that's why I think that like if you're doing anything talk about it publicly because you're going to attract other people that are gonna be into it yeah but I really think that there's um you know I you know in one of my ideas that I played around with is you is is one something that I've done um I I don't respond so well to rewards but I do respond really well to to downside um to to consequences so for example um what I was becoming the number one life insurance salesman when I was 23. this is in Texas I'm wearing a full suit carry the hard side hard sided briefcase and I said until I make my 20th bill I have to park on the top floor of the parking garage and take the stairs in Texas in the summer so literally every single day as I'm walking up six flights of stairs in a suit carrying a briefcase to my truck which has been sitting in the hot sun I'm like I had better freaking make a sale today I'm so sick of this and so I thought about that another time I set a goal and my bet was if I lose I have to donate a thousand dollars to my rival uh my rivalry universities endowment fund they don't they don't care at all about a thousand dollar right but it was that was meaningful to me at the time right there there are things that I was doing that I said these are the consequences so I was thinking about this accountability app was if I put 50 bucks on deposit in in this service I said if I'm not if I don't journal every day for the next 30 days that 50 disappears you could decide you could decide where it goes or you know however it sets up but like you tell everyone if I don't draw 30 days like this 50 bucks is going to be donated to a campaign for you know a politician that I don't like people would be like dude are you journaling me make sure you do that like don't don't expect that person right but like almost as I did and it's just like you get the money back it's your money if you do the thing you can lie and say that you did you that you did it but the whole point is like you're putting something at risk you're you're putting some price on establishing that habit and I think that's worse that's worth you know something I I think it's totally worth exploring yeah so setting up what is that negative incentives to motivate you to to do the thing yeah um I think yeah I think it's powerful and I like that also just as like a framework for thinking about so first of all I think accountability massively underrated and underpriced yeah underpriced underrated and I think negative incentives in our own lives just thinking about what we can do to uh to to keep keep us responsible is important yeah and I said I think that as you know as there's even more and more people that are opting out of the traditional system whether it be education or professionally and they say hey I'm going to do this differently um I'm gonna do it on my own a lot of the people that end up going back to the system go back because they did they didn't have their the perseverance or they or maybe sometimes the accountability right like being a solo preorder like is pretty lonely right like like your team meetings are just every time you look in the mirror and if you don't do it you're the only person who knows unless you like you do say hey this is the thing I'm gonna try I'm gonna put it out there and see if it works right experiment Belfast you know cool I didn't get to a million followers on Tick Tock using AI whatever right I'm really excited to see what you do with your YouTube channel I I you know I've been thinking a lot about the uh you know that that treat um you know but but you put a price tag right it cost you something to even be able to say old man helpless and that could be a financial cost it could be a social cost it could be a time cost like it doesn't necessarily need to be money but there has to be a cost associated with it to you greatness costs and that's why most people aren't great frankly because they're not willing to to risk it and I think it's a it's it's they're not they're not willing and this goes back to like curiosity but they're not willing to be curious and fail and get rejected and put themselves out there and do it day after day after day because that's really what it takes well and I think that they're you know I have friends that are sitting on incredible ideas but they didn't think that they would they would do it and so they kind of limited their options as to their ability to pursue it and they have a big boy budget I mean like they have expenses and they have you know private school tuition and they have a house and cars and they're like but I really want to pursue this thing and I'm like you really should they're like yeah but I need to be making half a million in like the pre-seed stage of the company in order for me this to work and I'm like well that's just never gonna happen like zero people zero people will invest in that and if you can't sell Finance like like this idea is going to sit on your shelf until somebody else does it and you know and I still think about it you know the you know my wife and I are both small business owners and we do our best to keep a pretty lean you know budget we have we have we live an amazing life don't get me wrong but the fixed cost part of what we do like we want to be as Nimble as we possibly can so that if that next opportunity arises and we have to go lean for a period of time okay okay and you know that won't always be the case but it's kind of it's you know it's Lifestyle by Design like you are somebody who wants to be able to take risks like keep your budget as little as low as possible if you're just getting out of school do not get a nice car do not get a nice apartment you are not in competition with your parents like don't try don't try to move into you know that neighborhood and impress people like it's time like it limits your options it limits your options so quickly you know why it's tough because you start making a little bit of money you start going out to restaurants so you like going to restaurants and then all of a sudden you're at you know you're ordering a glass of wine with dinner and then all of a sudden like you're used to a glass of wine at dinner now if you have to go start a startup and all of a sudden you say to yourself well now I can't have a glass of wine at dinner you might not be able to enjoy that meal and that's a bit of the problem so I think what you're saying makes a lot of sense which is sometimes like don't get that glass of wine in the first place um you know if you're if you're serious about building a startup and if you're serious about putting something out there if you're serious about being a solopreneur or a multi-preneur or whatever keeping your costs down is one another one of the greatest drinks that you can have yeah it gives you options and and just talk though because oh I know absolutely great absolutely great which by the way thank you for the recommendation at Tilly's um oh yeah yeah in in the great Caymans Greg gave me a great recommendation that I took my life there uh for her birthday and it was fantastic and we ordered a really great bottle of wine and one of these there basically every night uh so but but to your point right we can't order or we shouldn't order that bottle of wine on Tuesday yeah exactly like it's it's there and it will taste just as good on Tuesday as you did for her birthday but it is really hard to shed those habits if you get accustomed to them and I think going back back to our conversation about friends that's where in some ways my experience people stop being curious people stop trying new things people stop being rejected because they're accustomed to life being a certain way and trying a new thing like downsizing to you know for the chance to you know supersize I'm not too comfortable with that and I think that if you have the chance to to stay Nimble longer you have the chance to go a lot further could not agree more someone who listens to the Pod actually he's uh he's a Fortune 500 client executive Fortune 100 maybe and uh Paisley check out seven figures a year um and he he came to visit me in Miami and I picked him up in my Volvo which is like six or seven years old and he just starts laughing and he's like honestly I did not expect you to be driving like a seven-year-old Volvo and I was like oh I love this car you know it's perfectly fine like it's safe it like it works like you know I I love it and he goes oh I just figured you know you would have like a I don't know a big Mercedes or a Bentley or a Lambo or whatever and it I do it because I do want to keep my costs down and when there's opportunities that I'd rather take that money and and grow my business versus like grow my burn rate exactly yeah grow your business not your bird right yeah literally uh Andy I could talk to you for hours I want to thank you for coming on the show I think you're a criminally underfollowed literally it's a crime um so where where could people get those uh journaling prompts and follow you on the internet yeah so andyelwood.com um and just the the journal the journaling tab is on the homepage and uh I am at Andy L wood with two L's on all social platforms uh and pretty easy to track down if you if you type it out it looks like and yell would okay so what I walk into my boxing gym people go what and when you walk on the Playa people go boots exactly exactly but no it's uh you know I I try I try to be as generous as I can with the experiences that I've had and post them on on uh on adriela.com and then and then my newsletters make room.fm maker instrument so love to see people there all right enjoy it everyone later Andy thank you

Does everyone have an unfair advantage?

When it comes to entrepreneurship, the younger you start, the better you’re going to get at building and running businesses.

It's not about having everything figured out from the start; it's about leveraging what you do have to get going.

While many great businesses start with a strong foundation, the key lies in knowing when to adapt and reshape your strategies.

Yes, some entrepreneurs make a pivotal shift after years of struggle, but this isn’t the case for everyone.

Learning when to quit and move on is a crucial skill.

In entrepreneurship, don’t hold on to an idea for so long that it stagnates.

most great businesses they start out great but yeah there's a classic story of the pivot but even the pivot it's all I was two years in and I kept going but I did something totally different and that thing took off the idea that something you've done for multiple years and then one day it takes off you can also hold a stock too long and lose your ass like that may work for some people but I'm one of these people who goes I don't actually care why it's not working anymore at some point I gotta blow the whistle and I gotta reshuffle the deck and do that

https://www.youtube.com/@GregIsenberg

With so many social platforms available, how do you know which one to prioritize growing an audience on?

While the temptation to spread across multiple platforms may be strong, there's a strategic approach that can yield better results.

Stick to one platform.

Rather than diluting your efforts across various platforms, channel your energy into becoming a standout on a specific platform, whether it’s YouTube, Instagram, Twitter or Threads.

Building a loyal following requires dedication and consistency, and by committing to one platform, you can create a strong foundation for growth and influence.

the format of like a venture Studio was like really interesting for me it was like wait it would let me do all the things I love doing all the time and to me that I think finding something I could do for 50 years was actually like what led me to picking this is like I don't know if this is the highest expected value thing I could spend my time on maybe picking one idea and running with it and trying you know or being an investor I don't know but this was the thing that I actually felt most excited about a lot of people talk about growth assistant which is hit by millionaire they go Jesse why don't you focus all your time on that that seems like the obvious thing to do and I'll go yeah but what am I solving for you know anybody around this well you gotta make the most money you can possibly make I'm like well I want to focus on the thing that's going to energize me the most for the longest and so that's kind of what got me into starting Gateway X which is the name of the Venture Studio you know the three things that are distinct about it one every idea is kind of plays off of my unfair advantages so there has to something to do with customer acquisition problems that Brands and marketers have like something I understand or have some inbuilt distribution for the second thing is they're all like what I would describe as capital light businesses and I think there's a big opportunity between the sort of Lifestyle business and the Venture funded business there's a lot of businesses in between and then the third thing is they all kind of use my common cultural operating system you know types of meetings we run the way we give feedback all those things are sort of common so theoretically you should be able to sit in any of them and feel like you're kind of working at the same company I've been looking forward to this one for a while Jesse Pucci what's up Greg did you see my tweet on multi-preneurship I think I did the future is entrepreneurship yeah exactly that's a bit of like a hook to get people in but when I think of multi-preneurship which is someone who builds a company who builds companies I think of I think of you you're like Mr multi-preneurship yeah and aspiring at least no you're doing it like you're doing it I saw you know one of your companies pass 10 million ARR I believe yep um you also just have like a supplement company you've got some technology companies so I'm I'm just selfishly interested in just learning more about well first do you consider yourself a multi-preneur and and then just learn more about your businesses yeah yeah for sure I mean yeah I think so I I you know it's funny I when 2009 before I had ever been an entrepreneur I was working at Goldman Sachs and I put together this document and I still have it I'll send it to you after and it was it was to my ambush co-founder as the first company I started and it was like here's the vision for the future and I like to share especially with people like you because I was like man I was so early to this like hold code thing but the idea was literally we you know have good ideas execute them focus on generating cash flow and then once you have more and more of them like just keep multiplying it with the ultimate goal to actually be to build a an awesome organization where you get to coach teach people learn and an organization building has always been as important to me if not more important to me than the business building itself and we can talk about the difference between those two and then you know and then so I was 24 I think when I wrote the doc then I actually tried to start a company yeah turns out it's really hard to start a company and it takes every bit of you emotionally physically and I totally forgot about the doctor you know literally just totally forgot about it you know we end up through the trials and tribulations of a 10-year startup Journey which ultimately ended up in a success you know we exited but as I started working with a coach you know I actually completely forgot about the document but I started wearing the coach and started doing the stuff like what really lights me up you know what's my why and like you know sometimes we think of purpose as something we have to go attain or it's like a long-term thing we go get and one reframe he had for me that was powerful was like no it's just kind of how you want to be every day like what's going to bring you energy every single day I was like well there's a few things that bring me energy that that initial process of like spotting an opportunity and kind of initially peeling the onion putting the pieces together go get it I love that part I love and I'm very good at sort of like mobilizing a lot of things in One Direction and sort of that you know the early stages of something I love coaching and teaching people and I'm much more powerful as a teacher or coach usually than I am as like a straight doer I love stuff like this getting to know other people learning being challenged changed and so as I started thinking about what was next for me after after kind of that successful run at ampush this the format of like a venture Studio was like really interesting for me it was like wait it would let me do all the things I love doing all the time and and to me that I think finding something I could do for 50 years was actually like the goal or 50 plus years that would keep me energized and re-energize me and so that's kind of how I got into this is that's sort of you know obviously there's lots of different people influencing me along the way but that what led me to picking this and this is a really important distinction especially on Twitter twitterland where everyone tries to be right about everything is like I don't know if this is the highest expected value thing I could spend my time on my maybe picking one idea and running with it and trying you know or being an investor I don't know but this was the thing that I actually felt most excited about and I feel most excited about and energized by and so I was like I don't really care if it's the most high expected values might not be the best Roi decision like a lot of people talk about growth assistant which is a 10 millionaire they go Jesse why don't you focus all your time on that that seems like the obvious thing to do and I'll go yeah but that's not what am I solving for you know videos oh you gotta make the most money you can possibly make I'm like well that's not what I'm solving for this that thing's already making plenty of money and I'm good I want to focus on the thing that's going to energize me the most for the longest and so anyway that's kind of what got me into starting Gateway X which is the the name of the Venture studio um you know the three things that are distinct about it uh from my perspective are one every idea is kind of plays off of my unfair advantages so it has to something to do with customer acquisition problems that Brands and marketers have like something I understand or have some inbuilt distribution for the second thing is they're all like what I would describe as capital light businesses and I think there's a big opportunity between the sort of you know lifestyle business and the Venture funded business there's a lot of businesses in between that I call bootstrap Giants they're these ambitious but self-funded profitable companies that can grow for a really long time that's the type of business we want to start and then the third thing is they all kind of use my common cultural operating system and so they you know I could talk about that but it's meeting you know the types of meetings we run the way we give feedback all those things are sort of common so theoretically you should be able to sit in any of them and feel like you're kind of working at the same company um and that's kind of where the hold Co element comes into place but it's a different version of it because we're starting everything so far at least we're not buying anything but that's it that's a quick story I want to read you a text I got this morning there's been a lot of people we know including myself who've launched agencies including yourself actually too I mean growth is in a lot of ways is sure an agency so a very well-known person sent me a text message and he says I've seen so many of these agencies launch over the last six years number one big announcement number two get to 50K 50 to 100K a month mrr think you're building the next Uber and agency form number three uh-oh your way to efficiency was stealing other people's content and I'll go boosting number four clients start churning faster than you can replace them number five you hate your life number six Twitter public posts we've decided to shut down our agency number seven bring out the popcorn what do you think about that yeah I mean I think they're they're easy businesses to start they can be very challenging businesses to grow and operate I mean ampush ampush was not intended to be an agency but we turned into one um you know the story you know my quick story born and raised here in St Louis my dad is an entrepreneur always knew I want to be an entrepreneur one day I went to Penn I went to Wharton which is like the you know Wall Street trade school and that's been a couple years doing management consulting and then a couple years on Wall Street and and by the way you know Management Consulting in Wall Street we don't talk about this a lot but their services businesses just to be completely clear they sell Services they sell really high-end services but they're Services businesses so you can learn a lot about Services by actually spending time in those places and then we started ampush and we started doing it in Performance Marketing we discovered Facebook Facebook called us in our first year or so I said who the hell are you guys you know we were one of the fastest growing advertisers and we ended up being one of their earliest marketing partners and and they gave us access to their API we built software we tried to sell the software to people nobody wanted software they wanted Services they said hey I don't know how to run this and you know our customers at that time were a bunch of startups names a lot of names you wouldn't recognize but then a lot of names like uber Dollar Shave Club Peloton blue apron and and we always thought of it ourselves as a tech company until someone was like well why don't you just sell your Tech now then we were like well no people will pay us one or two percent of media for that but they'll pay us 10 or 15 of media for our services like why would we do that and that's when we kind of realized we were you know we'd become more of a tech enabled Services business there was a joke when I was a CEO I'd never call Ambush an agency because I was like we're so much more you know that's not what we are we're much more than that but you know I've talked to a lot of people since then and I think like people don't build them to scale you know I had the benefit of coming from management consulting where I saw this hugely scaled services Enterprise and I just things that they did naturally became natural to me so for example we recruited top young raw talent and we trained the hell out of them we always had a sales pipeline running to go along with the business in a very meaningful way we chose our customers carefully we chose customers who would grow over time so that like we didn't have to worry about churn even if there was some churn you would still have like your your sort of monthly Revenue would grow consistently and and you know we I was funny there's like a five-year period where I'd walk into Starbucks with my wife and I would just be like my jaw would drop and I'd be like oh my God this place is amazing and she's like what the wrong with you I'm like there's five employees here none of them owned this place none of them make more than 15 bucks an hour and they're all this this place is crushing it and that's actually what we became we like we need to make Starbucks and so we started designing these little pods internally where like every single you know the systems the way things work the way we manage them all became very very common um and that's how we scaled the business to you know half a billion a year in ad spending 200 people technology helped also but but it was really that Starbucks Suffocation of each pod inside the organization and then some of the reporting structures and things like that so they're really easy businesses to start then what happens is the founder runs the whole show they're never able to get away from any sort of client delivery or client service or anything and then you know all these everyone wants to take the business in-house at some point I mean that's that's just the natural uh way of things and it's just a matter of when not if that's another people lie to themselves about is like at some point they want to take it in-house one of the fun things about growth assistant is like it really is like a staff augmentation business and it's like kind of been the opposite of an agency like we get you people and so we've seen the retention in that businesses way better than the retention was at ampush because once you have a couple great people offshore you're not trying to lose them and you're not you don't care how much you're paying I mean you know you're not going to fight us over a few hundred dollars of margin that we're taking versus you or something but yeah I think I think they're tough businesses to run and scale yeah I think a lot of people are seeing Twitter People Like Us launch agencies and they're like well I want to do that there's also that guy Brett from design Joy who has a course on productizing agencies and I think that is a whole you know new new generation of entrepreneurs who are looking at this and being wow so you're saying you know going back to your asset light thing so you're saying I could basically build up a Twitter account launch a service and then all of a sudden be making seven figures a year right uh this is the dream this shit's so hard man you know I that's the thing like have you ever done the Enneagram no do you know what the Enneagram is it's kind of like a better Myers-Briggs I'm a huge fan of it and I'm a type seven and type seven is the Enthusiast and it's like the person who like jumps from thing to thing and you know gets excited by the shiny object and a lot of entrepreneurs not surprisingly are type sevens you know I had I grew up in a my dad obviously was you know with a lot a lot of ownership kind of an immigrant style you know upbringing I had good partners it would help me keep me focused but I think there's a lot of entrepreneurial types out there who are the enthusiasts are like oh yeah that like unless they get that going and then to run Services is hard enough to scale Services you have to become a great manager you have to become a great trainer you have to get good at writing things down you have to build it's boring ass stuff that helps you scale Services any business really but Services business in particular you got to give a lot of feedback to people you got to do a lot of things that are are the opposite of like launch something on Twitter and see if it'll grow and scale and and I think it's just you either got to pair yourself with the right person or you gotta create space in your mind that those things are important I I have the benefit of like knowing they're important not necessarily depending my strengths and so that allowed me to to kind of manage around them and find the right people to to be around um and get out of their way but if you don't really like I see a lot of hype guys and girls out there and you gotta go run these things man they're hard it's hard to run someone else's ad spend explain to them why it's working or not working manage their expectations put together a plan you can deliver against um we had this moment this is a crazy story actually so four or five years ago uh five six years ago McKinsey walked ampush in uh to Stars Lionsgate and so you know there's this huge movie house they're this like uh cable channel and they had decided they wanted to build an Ott service you know like HBO Max of stars you know it's a multi-billion dollar company they had a 300 million dollar annual marketing budget going towards like linear and billboards and all these random things and so McKenzie's like well we're going to take half of that 150 million and starts ampush is going to build you guys a digital marketing program so we built it from scratch built all the Google ads the Facebook ads they've been doing a little bit things but nothing that interesting we grow this program it starts to scale and it's they love it because it's so much more measurable than the stuff they're used to they're used like premieres or whatever the week before their biggest show Power premieres and what would happen is their CPA when their biggest show content would launch would drop by like 90 right their best show is about to show that's when all the sign ups happen and that's when you spend the most money and then when their shows aren't running you pull back the spend and we did all this optimization I think we were like two or three weeks out before their biggest show and the Facebook pixel breaks meaning all of us and McKenzie had been I don't know if they had been running it's something they basically said well no keep spending guys like and we said no no we don't think we should keep spending this no keep spending so the CPA went up to like 300 they say keep spending we keep spending and then all of a sudden they're like we're like well why can't we get the CPA back down I'm like well we told Facebook that we were okay with 300 Acquisitions their pixel now thinks that they're not it's not gonna work and so this thing gets at their CMOS involved their CEO gets involved I'm on a call I get dragged down to La they're like what is going on Jesse we pay you guys 5 million a year in fees like figure this out what is happening and I said guys we need to delete this pixel we need to go dark on Facebook for a week and then we need to reboot with new pixels by show or something like I had some strategy that involves shutting off Facebook is in the room with me and they're like no we don't agree with that plan and I was like I bet my account I bet the account guys if I'm wrong then take take this you know because we every quarter one of our clients pixels got all up on Facebook and we knew the plan and so we did the plan finally they agreed and like the first few days were dicey but then once we turned it back on everything kind of normalized again right ahead of their biggest Premiere and then like whatever everyone thought I was a savior but there was a point to the story which was like you know the you have to agencies are hard they're hard you you you you live in St Louis you get this call you're you know you're on the hook right you're on the hook like yeah we got down this road because yeah you were on the hook for someone else's results to explain it to them to help them understand it and to be able to like take the risk and put things on the line for it and it's not even yours and even if you do it you get you know 10 of spend or something like that and yeah so it just part of the reason I got excited about starting Adventure Studio was getting to own the businesses and not you know not doing it on on behalf of someone else and so I think if they seem like great idea does but in reality they're very challenging businesses another way to think about it is it's almost like you know you're on the hook and like you're going fishing you're on the hook you catch a fish but you don't get to keep the fish you just get to keep the lure totally like you keep a small piece of it you know the hope is that you get a bunch of lures and and that you can diversify and you know you're not just you know focused on whale fishing because if you're just whale fishing like as you know like that's another downside to agencies which is churn and clients churn yeah I mean they churn and our little trick we learned around this from the folks at Red Ventures was to get long wind down Provisions in the agreements and it's funny because I'll tell this to agency owners and you'll see their head just explode when when we talk about it and you know most of them are working month to month with a week and and they'll say well how would I say it's like well tell them that you can't fully invest in the account unless you have 60 days of notice so that you can properly readjust your resources it's better for them it's better for you and they're like oh wow and I'm like just imagine how your life changes if you have 60 days notice before someone can actually fully pull back the revenue and churn but I think it goes back to maybe your original point which is like people start these businesses because they think they're easy and and whatever and they're actually it's that's never a good reason to start a business but at the same time you look at you know growth assistant in in that business is doing well like what why do you think that service based business is doing so well um like is there a framework for starting a successful agency does that exist I think um you know some of the things I would think a lot about are I've been thinking about this a little bit lately I think number one is I think it's important to figure out what you want and what you're trying to Aspire for right so do you want to grow something to run it and make money do you want to grow it to sell it do you want to raise money like what what game are you playing um you know there's a one of my mentors though says what game are you playing and then how do you win that game and like how do you win is where everybody focuses but what game are you playing is actually usually the more important question so what game are you gonna play okay I want to start an agency I wanted to get to 2 million ebitda a year or 10 million ebitda what do you want I mean there's very different answers to that question how long were you willing to take all that stuff then the next question is like to me what's your unfair advantage and this by the way this is true for all businesses not just service but but like what what do you know and typically like it has to be a multiple like it has to be a crossover of at least two maybe three things that you really like because normally in the case of growth assistant like I knew growth marketing well I knew offshore well also you know Adrian had built a lot of recruiting engines and that sort of thing like there has to be a lot of things crossing over and then you go oh now I think I can be in the top five percent of these things because even any of them individually you're probably not in the top five percent so what's your unfair Advantage the next thing is like I always think of like building your one-page offer sheet like productizing your scope and what you sell is it five thousand a month is it 2 000 a month is it 10 000 a month and then also solving for gross margins inherent to that offer so it has to be something that you can push out and deliver and you're already thinking about having at least 60 gross margins so that you can go out and like it's like you know because once you shape the front of the offer and then people want to buy that offer then the whole part of the business is how do you deliver that offer at that margin like how do you consistently deliver the quality of that at that margin and that's step three step four is is like go out and sell to people especially people you know or people who know you know right like people who are going to be friendly is I'm pretty honest about where the things are I'm like hey this is new this is a new thing we're doing right now like what do you think about this uh and then and then the last I think most important Miss is like you got to deliver something amazing on the other side that's a critical and then once you deliver that amazing thing on on the other side you have to figure out how you're going to do it without being involved as the founder or the CEO that's like that part takes anywhere from six months to six years which is how can that thing happen when I'm not involved and I always like remember at ampush the Zen moment was like our sales guy closed the deal our onboarding team onboarded it the customers you know the clients success person brought it on and they did the services for it and the in in finance team invoice and collected the money and I had nothing but bullet point updates like I nothing hit my I didn't have to get involved at all and I was like oh this is starting a business and so yeah I think it's that last part is where I usually tell people I was just talking Alex Lieberman about this you know he's starting one of these uh influencer copywriter things for for people building their personal Brands and it's like you know you have five or ten customers let's say how do you make sure that it's less than 25 of your time and they're getting a better experience that may take you months like to actually get to that point but that's the point where you can scale and then you have to hire and kind of plug people back into that model consistently and see where it goes so that's the last part of it I think the other thing that I would say in my case in both the case I think of ampush and growth assistant you know you got to ride some Trends you know I think like we rode Facebook I mean that was the best wave ever right there was a many many multi-year period where we were the only like one of the few companies who could do Dr on Facebook um and then for growth assistant this is whole offshore Trend especially for marketing like that's that's a new thing it's not it's not a thing that's everywhere and and I think there's a lot of people starting these things that they don't have any uh you know they're not writing any Trends they're not writing any sort of secular Tailwinds behind that well it's a double Trend which is one from you know covid force a lot of companies to go to a remote and then the second trend is a lot of companies are looking at Cost cutting yes and and marketing is I I think this demand for growth marketing Talent versus Supply is way out of whack there's like not enough people who know how to do things on marketing and so plugging in people from offshore and one of the interesting things we've seen actually one of the funny selling points we have especially when we're talking to more senior people for growth assistant is growth assistant helps you retain your own team like what like yeah you hire we're not talking about the talent our talent we're talking about the talent scarce on your side so you don't want to lose this awesome growth lead or this awesome Facebook ads person and if you make them do all the crappy work all the time and you don't have a growth assistant They're Gonna Leave You know if you have them sitting there uploading ads for four hours every day every other day like they're not gonna like their job so a growth assistant it takes on the work they don't want to do and guess what that person is going to stick around longer um and you we're starting to see that exciting Trend where people move companies and they're like hey I need some growth assistance now and so I think that's also been a big Trend around you know marketing as a talent it's kind of like engineering like there's always been this missing unlimited demand for engineering Talent if you can find it and that's it's really a supply driven game and I think the same thing's happening in marketing you talked about unfair Advantage a lot of people listening to this are going to be like easy for you Jesse you just sold you know ampush and have a hundred thousand or whatever Twitter followers or easy for you Greg you know you have the this big community of people that you can just seed ideas to my question to you is does everyone have an unfair Advantage yeah like if you're I think the younger you are I think the younger your college student just starting off like you know you're living in a you know small town in India and you don't have a huge Network either on social or in your own town city whatever yeah I think the the younger you are maybe the harder it is to have a super valuable unfair advantage but you definitely have some unfair advantage and I don't I don't mean to say that it should be the end-all be-all of your entrepreneurial career but it's gonna make starting something easier there's we have an intern this summer who who goes to Duke and he manages the tick tock for Duke basketball and I'm like he's super entrepreneurial he's amazing at he's doing all these different you know stuff and he's like what should I start Jesse and I was like well what do you know really well and I was like you know how to get into Duke you should start a social you know Tick Tock channel for how to get into Duke and sell people a 50 or 100 guide you know that it and I was like maybe you sell it to a thousand people a month or something like that you know I don't know there's probably five million people who apply to these these top schools or whatever and I'm like it's just enough to get you going and you're gonna learn more through that process and you're going to build other unfair advantages as you do it um and that's a big part of of getting anything going we didn't we didn't know anything about digital marketing when I was 25 when we started ampush we knew numbers and data and we had a you know decent network from our friends in college and other worlds and we just use the things we we had we you know and we tried to squeeze the most out of them that we could and then we learned as we went how to do more and more of those different things so I think it's it I think it's strange when someone doesn't know anything about anything and they're like they pick a random sector and they start going in at it like there's some people who can do that and it works but the vast majority of people you know it's a real struggle there's some people who well first of all if you're listening to this you have an unfair Advantage yeah like if you're if you're listening to this you beat 99.9 of people because you're going out there and you're trying to gain information to better yourself you have some unfair Advantage now there's going to be a group of people who will tell themselves who are not listening to this but who will tell themselves I don't have an unfair advantage and who play kind of like that victim mentality and I feel like you have access to the internet you have an unfair Advantage period yeah and I think again remember it's multiple things my definition of it is it's multiple unique intersection points of who you are so if you're in a town a small town in India but you do you read Twitter it's like okay you're you know you speak Hindi you're in the small town you have access to all these people and you read Twitter okay those are enough unfair advantages for you to construct something that's going to be of value to somebody probably it's educating those young Indian children about chat gbt or something like that right there's always some unfair Advantage when you look at enough vectors of your life overlapping that you're going to be the top five percent of that thing and that's a great place to just get going so moving on a little bit to unbloat I look at that and I'm like why is this guy creating a you know on like I first of all like a d2c product like he he he's got this like cash flowing you know eight figure business that's doing really well and then I'm looking at that I'm like oh man that is probably so hard to like go and find the product and create it and create the brand and dude like take out the Facebook ads why did you why did you what got you excited about that and where's what's the opportunity that you're saying that someone like me is not saying yeah it's a good it's a fair question you know it's it's uh I had built I had helped so many Brands grow you know Hubble contacts Dollar Shave Club Birchbox I mean you name it we had helped them scale and if not scale built their customer acquisition from the ground up and so I think more than anything I was like man I want to do this myself like I want to do I actually know what I'm doing is it actually different if I own the brand or is it just gonna feel the same you know I kind of said all right well I know what works on these things like high margin recurring Revenue solves a real problem and has fun marketing angles like okay so I kind of had this formula you know this idea in my mind of what could work and high margin recur like you know you get into the medicine supplement area pretty quickly I was also trying to find what else fit that profile that's done really well and erectile dysfunction was like a I don't know there's like at least three multi-billion dollar d2c Brands started off erectile dysfunction so it's like I want to find something as big as that and so we went and talked to seven or eight doctors and asked them a bunch of questions but the main question we asked them was what's the one thing people complain to you about that they can't that you don't have a good answer for and we got 43 different issues from foot doctors and tummy whatever and we literally just searched them try to see the search volume how much Amazon volume and then like are there products on the market for them and only one issue was as big as erectile dysfunction it was bloating and it was like wow I would just never have guessed that right I'm sure you wouldn't have guessed that either that it's searched more often than Ed um and so we're like well what is it and and we actually started talking to people and what tell me about you you blow what does that what does it feel like what does it look like and really there was two and then we started talking to kind of the people who make you know stuff and supplements trying to figure out what causes it and how do you solve it and really it like came into Focus for two reasons I think one is similar to Ed it isn't not just a medical issue it's like a very distressing emotional issue because nobody and especially women and especially pre-menopausal women who tend to be the biggest customers they want they don't want to feel fatter or look fatter than they are like they don't want to gain weight and like it's a it's a stressful issue it makes them like want to go home from the gym or not go out for the night um like oh wow okay and then the second thing was like it's pretty solvable like there's four reasons primarily why people blow they don't digest food they don't poop they have like issues with their diet you know their digestive system of the bacteria or whatever and they're not getting enough of certain things and you can kind of solve all of it and we like went out and looked at all the skus on the market and realized you'd have to buy four or five skus to get all the things you need and we sort of just did the dumb entrepreneur thing where we said can you put this all in one pill and the manufacturer was like it's like an expensive pill but you can do it so we're like all right let's let's try that let's throw it all into one pill so that was kind of how we got started with it and then running the Facebook ads I'd say definitely has been more challenging than I expected but but you know the business is at about 3 million in sales it's making a little bit of money it's only 14 months old I think like for the most part I've been pretty happy to say like a lot of the things that we built at ampush and I learned over those 10 years has translated into being able to like get this thing off the ground successfully um it's not perfect by any means but but like there's a lot of opportunity I see in it and um and like we think it's the first of many things we'll launch like that yeah I think I actually think that there's probably some commonalities that exist uh between unbload and growth assistant so I think the you know just unbloating is a trend that you like I just been in my own life just hearing more and more people talk to me about I feel so uploaded I feel so uploaded seeing it on Tick Tock like I've Just Seen stuff people taught how to stop bloating yeah so I think you just like you tap into that I also think that both growth assistant and unbloat have really good names like and enough people don't talk about how important the name yeah is to the success of some of these products but unbloat.me I think is your url which I think is really really high quality the funny thing is you know we did a painted door test to figure it out I don't know if you've ever done one of those but we had five completely different brand names and like basically had the like fake brand where we were like sign up for 20 off of the launch and I think one of the brands was feather one was rhythm um I forget the other two and then unbloat and like we spend 500 on each just to see kind of click-throughs and sign ups and unblow it was off the charts relative to the other four yeah just it's you look at it and you know what it does uh you look at growth assistant you know what it does so that that feels very it just feels very Gateway X now that I'm starting to see what what you're creating which is really cool that you're creating and I think a lot of people should think about this is how do you how do you think about your values or your culture of creating new products and maybe you're just doing this it sounds like you're doing this a bit subconsciously but there's that and then I think you know recurring Revenue you you have a recurring Revenue component a lot of testimonials and stuff like that a lot of credibility how do you think about paid versus audience so to me growth assistant correct me if I'm wrong grew a lot from Twitter people talking about it uh it feels like I'm bloat has grown more from a paid marketing perspective how do you think about organic versus paid when you're creating new products yeah I mean I'll much rather have organic or paid if I can you know it's interesting I I'm probably to a fault I under template businesses because I just don't believe that you can you can put everything in a box and think it's going to work out a certain way well I have a question for you why wouldn't you have said if you prefer organic to paid why wouldn't you just look at start unbloat and just be like okay everyone we are not gonna spend one dollar on paid in the next 12 months just so we can build the muscle for building audiences building communities I think that's a good idea I we started the first few months with like Hey we're only going to do Tick Tock organic to learn it and you know we just didn't make the progress I think I would have liked to make and I think you you know there's a constant interplay between the people running the businesses and different skill sets and different things that start to play out and you know you can't you you have to you have to balance those two things out with one another all the time right and I think one of the things that makes this model work and and obviously one of the liabilities like I can't be everywhere at all times right or if I did want to be everywhere at all times I'd have to go much slower I'd have to do fewer things and it's like okay first spend five years learning how to audience build and Community build use Jesse's genius at doing this because I know how to do it then we're going to learn how to like disseminate that out to different things which which could have been an option for how we approach this and but but we didn't we you know and so I think we tried it we gave it I don't know three or four months the team was not able to come up with enough creative with it I'm sure if I you know if I'd spend more time we would have given us a better shot at doing that and I said well we knew we do know the paid media Playbook Let's Get Enough scale in this thing and that's going to be able to fund future ability to test different things let's get that going and the other thing is like that is a core skill set of mine or core thing I know I know like I don't know Tick Tock organic now I know Twitter organic but just I learned that On My Own by doing it over the last two or three years so I don't know I'm a little bit more random like I don't need again templatized structured ways like I think every business kind of Finds Its Own Way and I think there's different unfair advantages along the way I think you can get better at certain things I'm not huge on the like let's just do you have to do it this way like find a way the the way is not necessarily like I don't have religion around it let's talk about Kahani is that how I pronounce it SAS product you've got your service service based business you got uh your d2c business and then you've got a SAS business why'd you start that where was the opportunity and what's interesting to you about SAS yeah I think the the SAS one I mean this one has actually been the hardest probably by far um for me at least in you know I think and and maybe the right at least so like it's the one furthest away I think from what I know the other two are sort of like decomposed amps like selling things to brands on one side and then the other thing's running ads which is sort of what I did for 10 years you know I I think this one was hey what's a big what's a big bet we can go take and try to figure out a solution for and it was like Hey the Ecom experience just seems old and and seems really boring and meanwhile you know we're on Tick Tock and Instagram and they're so so immersive there's vertical media you're tapping you're swiping why isn't the Ecom experience like that also and so the first product we launched was basically stories for the Ecom experience so you could go into an Ecom site and you could tap those circles at the top and you'd be in the stories experience and this this was a really good lesson for us you know I think every single person who sees it goes wow that is super cool and then they're like all right I gotta go and you're like well when are you gonna buy this and they're like I don't know I got some other things I got some other priorities on my list and so you know it became a solution chasing a problem uh it's just no we just noticed that very quickly within six months of launching and we had you know we had some decent mrr and distribution but it just wasn't you could just tell it wasn't necessarily capturing anyone's challenges like we we went to shop talk and I had the sales guy from both companies there and from Kahani and growth assistant and growth assistant you know they do all this matching stuff the growth system guy got 25 meetings that kind of guy got five meetings and it was just very clear and now the five meetings that Connie got were interesting Nike was one of those meetings and we were why Nike we asked him why'd you meet us they go well we need it we need better ways to do discovery on our site and we think this is really Innovative and blah blah blah and so that one has been one where I'd say we're definitely dealing with the more classic product Market fit issue we're trying to reboot the product now a little bit because the signal we got was that people really want ways to leverage their influencer content and repurpose it and then the other big one was like if you can help growth marketers lower CPA that's when there's a real people will pay you for something like this cool little thing at the top like they may buy it but it's just not that interesting for them and so that one has been an interesting one but but I think like SAS I mean obviously it's it's it scales it's software it's recurring Revenue I think there's plenty of problems I have a decent understanding of but Building Product is hard and like one of the big differences I learned between services and and software is in Services a growth assistant or ampush you could kind of tell me your problem in a vague term you know here's my issue and I'd say well here's a human this human can probably adjust themselves to solve that really nuanced specific problem you have in software the code has to do that and that means you really have to get intimate with a problem and understand in a really deep way and I think like it's just a very different challenge how do you know when to quit so how do you know with Connie you know you're at this moment where it's like okay we've got to change this we've got to move this uh uh you've got some signals that are suggesting like wow there's something here but you've got others being like I don't know how do you how do you know when to just put it up on acquire.com or just like shutter it versus like we need to double down because you know Nike is huge and they spend millions and millions of dollars a year you know Nike itself could be a five million dollar a year account there's no perfectly right answer for it I think from my perspective my point of view and like I I used to chase things a little too long I think early in my career and learned this from the guys at Red Ventures and and Rick my mentor there you know it's a little bit like there's a there's an adage in trading that you never go broke by taking a profit and what they mean by that is like yeah you may sell the stock early but if you always sell when you're when you're when your stocks up a little bit you're never going to go broke you're always going to make a little bit of money and yeah you may give up some upside whatever I think the entrepreneur's version of that is like you never go broke by making a quick pivot and so you know I think how long have we given it a year in change like I I think the to me it's like no more than a year you know and six months of like really out there selling it pushing it pressing it hundreds of conversations most great businesses you know they start out great meaning and yeah there's a classic story of the pivot but even the pivot it's all I was two years in and I kept going but I did something totally different and that thing took off right the idea that something you've done for multiple years and then one day it takes off I mean again you can also hold a stock too long and lose your ass like it's it's the that may work for some people or the Laura is it there but I'm one of these people who goes I don't actually care why it's not working anymore it's just at some point I gotta blow the whistle and I gotta I gotta like you know re reshuffle the deck and and do that and so I think it's like arbitrary it's you know a year six months a year like it's it's not that long yeah I feel like the the Hallmark of a good multi-preneur is someone who who knows when to shudder things even though closing things down or selling them those are those are really hard to do because you're kind of admitting yeah you're admitting defeat and as multipreneurs we're kind of just like we've got a lot of conviction in the ideas that we want to put out um especially when we're putting it out publicly right if you're putting it out on Twitter and you're like hey you know this is the future of shopping and then six months later it's like you're like no it's not here's here's the thread on we're shutting it down yeah eat some popcorn uh so it's it's well I think it's the most brutal part is like you know you you hire people I care a lot about the people who I work with and then you know in this case we had to let go of a few people like you know there's the people join they sign their careers up for it and then you're just honest and you say guys I just don't think this is going to be what we thought it was and you know I hope over we have enough scale of Gateway X over time to absorb people into different parts so it doesn't their jobs don't have to be on the line but we're not quite there yet and that that part's you know it's it's a your idea your things and then having a big human impact on on other people and I think that's something you know I never want to get comfortable with but but it's a big part of of what we do if someone wants to build their own Gateway acts if someone wants to become a multi-preneur how to what what advice do you have to them to do to be successful you know if I could do it all over again I would have remembered that document earlier in my my journey at ampush I think the the best multipreneurs you know we talk about this on Twitter me and you and people are doing it but like you know Mark Zuckerberg is a multi multi-preneur yeah you know how many p l is running like he's got WhatsApp he's got Instagram he's got the big blue app he's got his Oculus stuff he's got some AIS I mean there's a lot of organizations you know and Elon Musk and him aren't all that different even though they're technically separate companies right or GE or Microsoft or Red Ventures or apple I mean these are all anyone running these scaled businesses is running multiple things like there's just no way they're not and and the same challenges come up you got to have the right peoples you got to have the right culture operating systems in place all these different pieces of it so if I if I could do it all over again or if I was giving someone advice I would say find one thing like find one business and just go really hard at it for five to seven years and and make it enough scale so that you can either sell it and make a lot of money or it generates enough cash flow that you can you have some flexibility and make sure along the way you built a culture and you train to people so that you can be done you know you can move yourself out of the day-to-day at around year five or year six and then from there start to like expand out into multiple different areas be using the unfair advantages you developed over those five to seven years right but I think the idea of people come to me yeah I don't think I could have done this I couldn't I tried to do this at 25 I had the document and I totally forgot about because I didn't even know how to do anything and so I think you need some foundational skills knowledge Capital have to a certain point now in this case I started Ambush I learned all these things I sold it now I'm doing it in this new format and there's some challenges with that you know in and of itself but I think you need a foundation I don't think it's a thing you can do with starting at age 25. I just don't um there's this you know Michael Rubin I'm sure you you saw him it was so funny when I was 19 there was a Wharton summer camp and we met him and at that point you know his business like it's just just to think about where a guy like that started he had he had three ski shops and he had just launched Sports Authority's website as GSI Commerce which was his first business it was this business that took over the dot-coms or created.coms for retailers and fully operated them on the back end and he ran that business for 12 years I mean it was the most unglamorous business you could imagine he had warehouses for Sports Authority and he'd run all these outcomes and he had the same he was kind of a big agency because eventually they'd want to run it themselves you know I don't know if you know his story but they you know his story at all I do uh yes and he sells it to eBay then he spins back the best assets to himself and the best of the best assets like his brain clearly like like I did with unbload he was like what's the one group of people who's always going to want to Outsource this that have the highest value apparel out there oh sports teams okay I'm gonna sell my whole business to eBay but then I'm gonna buy Fanatics back now Fanatics is worth 10 times whatever GSI was ever worth but that was like a 25 year journey I mean he spent a lot of time grinding and learning as he went and so I think I think you need a good five to ten year period of depth and building fundamentals and then from there you can spawn into launching multiple different things using those unfair advantages yeah fnatics is actually a client of late checkout and dispatch or design subscription and just learning about that business has been like nuts nuts I did a business breakdown on I don't know if you've ever heard that podcast that I record but we interviewed their main investor at Insight Venture and it's a Nutty business yeah it's pretty cool but like but like again he couldn't have started that without 10 to 15 years at GSI Commerce which was this like really unknown unheard of whatever business it was a grind yeah I think the the MVP of being a multipreneur is can you create content in one Niche that people resonate with like can you before you create product Market fit can you create content Market fit in one topic then can you do it in two topics and then can you build one product and then can you build two products and then it's just you layer it on as you get older it's definitely easier in your unfair Advantage grows um but you know unless I I don't want to dissuade the 17 year old who's listening to this who you know because I think there's you just just start yeah just start I mean that's always the answer is just try to do something yeah I you know my one of my biggest mistakes in college and I always tell this when I talk to college kids is like I always used to joke my brain was bigger than my legs so I could think I was a Wharton kid I was like oh here's the market size and oh you know we had a we had a teacher of business in college that did 200 000 a year in sales and like 70 000 need but uh like it's a good business for college kids and we thought we we thought about expanding it once to be a national college we basically did bulk apparel for all the fraternities and sororities that was the business and our Big Wharton brains are like ah the Market's too small this is not a good idea and meanwhile like our legs didn't know how to actually build a business like that but just learning anything we could have gotten you know to something that would have been very meaningful and actually one of my co-founders friends started a similar business on his campus and he came up with this genius idea of like I'm gonna have uh I'm gonna sell a sponsorship to like Pepsi on the t-shirts and provide them for free to sororities and fraternities and I'm gonna make twenty dollars a shirt instead of seven dollars a shirt and he turns it into a multi-million dollar business that he ends up selling right and so the lesson is just like just start get things going solve the other thing I always tell college kids is try to get your just your hall on an app before you think you can sell the world on something can you get the 20 people who you see every day to do it like to use a common app to like plan groceries or something just you build the app build a simple app and I'm like you'll learn how hard it is to get something done like to build something and that and that lesson is super valuable that's why I think building an audience or building a community even like a WhatsApp group chat or a group chat is such a great place to train yourself on can I create something that people are going to want to do because people are busy they don't have time to download your app unless you're Mark Zuckerberg and you're launching threads um you know so I think that's why I love just starting with audiences and communities anyway yeah it's one of my earliest pieces of advice too to people is they're like oh I want to start a business that sells life insurance to Millennials and blah blah blah I'm like well can you just why don't you just start a newsletter for them and see if they'll just like read about what you're talking about right before you sell them something yeah you give them information for free exactly it'll actually read it totally and they're like oh that's really hard actually yeah Jesse if people want more of you where do they go and follow you in the journey uh Twitter and threads I guess Jay Fuji uh jspu jji Jessie gateway.xyz you know we're always looking to to meet potential people who want to partner with us to build businesses uh always looking for interesting opportunities to collaborate across the spectrum of what we're doing love it well thanks for the time this is uh this has been great Mr multupreneur thanks Greg appreciate it yeah see ya

remote work is a very contentious topic right now like my last company was evangelizing remote work everybody should work remote we never need to go to an office again but I've spent most of my career as a remote worker at this point and I feel extremely ungrounded either we're going back to offices at least a couple days a week or there's gonna have to be a lot of innovation in how we can engage with each other especially for junior employees the reason I have a technical background is because I worked in an office with other people and learned from them I don't think I would have gotten that virtually

Description:
https://www.youtube.com/@GregIsenberg

The decision to pursue venture capital (VC) funding or bootstrap your business is a critical one.

With VC funding, the potential for rapid growth and scale is unparalleled. However, it comes with high stakes, requiring you to convince seasoned investors of your vision and execute swiftly.

Bootstrapping allows for more immediate financial rewards and direct impact. As a self-funded entrepreneur, you have the freedom to shape your business and experience personal wealth sooner.

There’s no right or wrong choice.

It entirely depends on your goals in the long term as an entrepreneur.

the scale that you can get with BC is very different you have to have high conviction convince a bunch of really smart people about it and then do something fast it doesn't work you get to move on to something else whereas with a bootstrap company you don't get that kind of feedback I think you make money faster you can be personally wealthy faster and you get to help people directly but you don't get that opportunity for scale unless you work on it for 15 years

The biggest problem with artificial intelligence isn’t AI stealing your job: it’s proof of personhood. Who is behind the content we consume? Can we rely on the authenticity of online interactions?

The challenge lies in establishing proof of personhood, bridging the gap between AI and web three wallets to bring about a new era of trust.

the biggest problem is proof of personhood who posted this online is it a real human can you trust it there's something in between Ai and web3 wallets that allow you to put a stamp on every single thing that goes on the internet whether it's content or a transaction or a photo of you or whatever it is but I can't imagine we can move forward in a safe way without something like that

In business, when you raise venture, even the best investors only have a small hit rate. Success is intertwined with innovation and meeting the needs of your target audience.

When you have investors, you can’t just build a business and run it forever. You have to deliver returns to those individuals.

I think it's capitalism at its core where everyone succeeds if you innovate and make something people want investors at least if they're institutional investors they also have limited partners and those are really the people they have to get returns for it can't just be a business that you run forever it needs to at some point return money to all these people that taken money from very early on

Venture Capitalists aren’t just sitting there writing checks.

They face the tasks of identifying problems, understanding the future, and taking bets on the right people.

The stakes are high, as their ability to navigate this complex landscape determines their success in raising funds and securing their own livelihood.

Because if they can't do that, they can't raise another fund and then they don't have a job…

For many aspiring entrepreneurs, the journey begins with a burning desire for freedom. They yearn for autonomy, the ability to steer their own ship and shape their destiny.

But amidst the pursuit of this coveted freedom, it's crucial to tread carefully and avoid falling into the trap of chasing mere proxies and artificial versions of it.

While external strategies and imitations may promise a semblance of freedom, they often lead to stress, obligation, and a never-ending cycle of pressure to perform.

In the hustle and bustle of life, we often overlook the importance of play and connection.

But here's the secret: by making room for play, we create opportunities for powerful moments of connection, growth, and ideas.

Those seemingly ordinary walks or conversations can lead to profound insights and deepening relationships -sparking creativity.

Nine times out of ten, people are willing to help you.

They are ready to offer their guidance and support if you simply ask for it. But there's more to it than just reaching out online.

For Antonio Neves, the way to truly build meaningful connections, is face-to-face. Whether they're based in San Francisco, New York, or New Orleans, find a way to put faces to the names you admire.

Investing in these experiences can open doors and create lasting connections that transcend the digital realm.

Title: Content Creation: Creators vs. Companies, With JT Barnett (BarnettX & CreatorX)
Published: 2023-07-01 14:00:04 UTC
Description:
People want to watch content that provides value.

They don’t want to get sold to.

Most companies with a product to sell often approach content with a sales-driven mindset. But this doesn’t work. As a result, they struggle to build an engaged audience.

Whereas creators succeed in building a following because they aim to connect and provide value to their audience.

The brands that are able to build an audience do so because they focus on the end user and prioritize their needs, rather than their own need to sell.

when people make content they're not selling as much because they don't have a product to sell they're just like putting their out there they're hoping that somebody likes it companies have a product that they've worked hard on so they approach content in a way of we have the best product in the market we gotta sell this people need to know about it let's push it out there and force onto people's for you Pages or timeline as consumers when you see that you immediately want to swipe past it I'm here to watch things that actually provide me value not to get sold to that's why the companies that think about who they're making the content for and actually provide that end user value are the ones that are able to build audiences

Description:
Mr. Beast is one of YouTube's most iconic personalities.

But he didn’t find success right away

In his first year, MrBeast gained a total of 14,000 views. Then in his second year, this dropped by 50%.

Unlike most, this setback only served to ignite his resolve further.

Growing an audience on any platform takes a long time, and at times you’re going to suck.

It’s all a part of the journey.

Mr Beast tweeted the other day total number of views that he's had in every year he's been acting on YouTube and the first year I think he had 14 000 views total not a huge number over the course of a year and then the second year he had 7 000 views so it got cut in half he went even harder most people at that point would have been so discouraged and they would have started to self-doubt themselves and they would have quit they would have stopped making content you're gonna start creating content you're probably gonna suck at it two probably nobody's gonna care for a long long time but that is the point that is part of the process you've got to go through that and that allows you to find your voice develop a visual style communication style learn see what works what doesn't what resonates with an audience and so I'm like just have to start and then have patience

[Music] [Music] all right all right Emma Emma Lawler [Music] so thank you for having me on welcome welcome welcome so you're a friend of the editor of the Pod we've actually never spoken but she said Ari was like you gotta meet Emma she's like a Dynamo and um so I wanted to meet you we were gonna just meet kind of for coffee or whatever but I was like let's just do it on the Pod and we'll just make a public conversation awesome so here we are yes I I didn't meet her but she was a producer for Indie hackers and I chatted with them a few weeks back so super excited to be here cool so yeah tell me a little bit about who Emma is and and what makes Emma really really Dynamo I guess um yeah so I started my career as a product designer and uh was in San Francisco in what I would say was the peak of web 2 so got to learn from really awesome Engineers product managers designers at that time spent a lot of my early career at Fitbit and so um was working on both physical and digital products there on iOS Android and web and then stayed through the IPO so really saw this upward trajectory of what it looks like to be an entrepreneur in Silicon Valley at that time and then started my first company called Moonlight and and that was when people were leaving the Bay Area and New York to go live in like Mexico City or wherever and and still have access to really high quality work so that first company was enabling remote work for software Engineers who still wanted to work with companies in the Bay Area and get paid to do that after that I we sold the Moonlight actually to a company called pull request in Austin that was a great experience as well learned a lot mostly how to do it better in the future and then um was in New York at that time and went and worked at the skim leading product and so they were trying to apply the New York Times model of content monetization to their podcasts and newsletters and things like that and then decided I wanted to go back to business school so that that's not the normal trajectory for entrepreneurs but went to Chicago Booth for the past two years and got a ton of more formal traditional business training on the finance side of things and then also got to work in BC so I worked at a BC firm called Chicago Ventures as an entrepreneur in Residence and got to help invest in a bunch of companies and started my company that I'm working on now called velvet and then they funded that company so now I'm moving back to New York we'll be working on velvet full time with my co-founder and yeah very mining path but have learned a ton about cross-platform consumer apps through all of those experiences and you look young so I look younger than I am I'm I'm 33. um so I just went to business school later in life which was also interesting hanging out with a bunch of like 28 year olds who are trying to party and travel all the time I mean I was just judging based on like how you looked and also I'm just like can't put two and two together because you've done like eight things and I mean uh so I kind of want to wind back a little bit so starting with Fitbit like you know you you join this company relatively early it goes public like why did you leave why did you stay with the company yeah so I joined Fitbit through an acquisition of a small startup called fitstar we were about 15 people at that time um and so went from being in a very entrepreneurial environment to uh pre-ipo tech company that was about 2 000 people when I joined so that was a really big transition but learned a ton through that process like I think what you get at a later Stage Company is a bunch of really experienced people who have done this over and over again and know how to be professional technologists and scale something and have a full sales org and all of that but late stage companies are probably not for me like I like I like being in a very entrepreneurial role where I get to talk to end users solve problems for them make a really big impact and so I just had that entrepreneurial itch from very early on in my career and and that first seeing that first acquisition I saw those those Founders life like really changed through that acquisition as well so that's what led you to start Moonlight in your mid-20s yeah you raise funding for that or yeah so half of it was bootstrapped because my co-founder and I wanted to be digital Nomads so we lived in like eight different cities outside the US and then once we moved to New York we raised BC from institutional VCS so it was half and half and are you more of a bootstrap person you said you were on Indie hackers which is more of a bootstrap Community or are you more in the camp of like Rave Venture go big how do you think I would say I yeah I'm good at being an indie hacker type entrepreneur but I like having VC funding like I think the scale that you can get with BC is very different you have to have the high conviction convince a bunch of really smart people about it and then do something fast and like if it doesn't work you get to move on to something else whereas with a bootstrap company you don't get that kind of feedback so it's like I think you make money faster you can be personally wealthy faster and and you you get to help people directly but you don't get that opportunity for scale unless you work on it for like 15 years so it's just a very different approach I think it doesn't stress you about that when you raise Venture it's kind of like even the best investors only have a small hit rate like it doesn't it doesn't stress you out that you know you are a lottery ticket in a game of Lottery it does stress me out but I kind of like that stress like I think it makes me better to have a bunch of other people who also are depending on me for their outcome like investors at least if they're institutional investors they also have limited partners and those are really the people they have to get returns for so I think it's it's just like capitalism as at its core where everyone succeeds if you innovate and make something people want but it does have to be a 10x return like it can't just kind of be a business that you run forever it needs to at some point return money to all these people that you you've taken money from very early on that's the perfect answer that a VC wants to hear when they ask that question to a founder they want they want the answer to be yes it's stressful I didn't get eight hours of sleep last night I want to drive returns for you know VCS in their LPS because I wanted knock it out of the bar yeah yeah and that's that's something I didn't understand actually the first time I raised BC like I was very frustrated when I was in my 20s about the whole VC ecosystem because it felt unfair in a lot of ways and so I think going to business school and working at a VC fund I actually have a lot more empathy for the job of being a venture capitalist because it's very stressful for them as well they're not just like sitting there writing checks they have to identify problems understand the future take bets on the right people and then like if they can't do that they can't raise another fund and then they don't have a job so it's um I think it was helpful for me to be in the room and be less scared of it and be like oh this is just economically how it works um if you want to be in the VC ecosystem at least so you sold the business you sold Moonlight to pull request what was it can you talk a little bit about the m a process and and what you learned around how to sell a company yeah um I had no idea what I was doing so we just went to our investors and um they introduced us to a variety of people who might be interesting and then we also went back to like our first Enterprise customers and things like that and pretty much ran a sales process very similar to fundraising so just having as many calls as possible and then narrowing down a few prospects um and then the deal process was pretty quick I mean we were in an early stage company at that point um so it's kind of like do you want to do this or not like do we want to keep running this business or raise more funding or do this deal and so it was it was the peak of the pandemic when we did that and it was just the right outcome for us at that time and then that company bought Moonlight kept it running in the way that we had originally designed it and like actually bought the platform it wasn't an aqua hire situation so that was really attractive as well because we had just built this really strong community of software developers around the world um and they were you know living off of the platform so um great experience overall and I think it's just like you have to try to get an an exit in most cases but if you try there's something out there that will be a good fit for all of your users that you've built over time you're lucky that it was like the deal process went so smoothly I you know one of our portfolio companies I was just speaking to the founder today and he he had signed an Loi with a really well-known uh company to buy their company and they had been talking for months like they do you know had spent 50 to 100 000 in legal fees in one day uh this acquirer woke up and was like you know what like I don't love this team I thought after like interviewing them and stuff like that and uh said like hey we'll we'll continue to do this deal but it's going to be at like um you know 50 haircut to to to what the the deal was and the founder had to sit there and be like I don't know if I want to do this because if if I take a 50 haircut that really means the investors are taking 50 haircut and at that point I'm kind of just like I'll just close this and start something else and you hear that time and time again where you know most deals flop they don't end up happening and you just gotta assume that like the transaction is going to fail but it sounded like for you you kind of just you had this deal you signed the deal you did the paperwork and all of a sudden you're like it was done yeah it was pretty fluid but I will say it's mostly just the tenacity of following through like I think at any point we could have decided it would have been easier to not do it but have you ever shut down a company yeah I'm constantly shutting down yeah it's like a really horrible process like shutting down a company is is way worse than like going through the motions to get acquired or raise more money it's just a horrible process do you know uh Nikita beer the founder of gas and TBH so he he sold TBH to Facebook now meta and he sold and then basically the same app it was literally the same like he basically sold it to Facebook uh it was this Anonymous polling app a lot of people know the story like worked there for four years on day like you know a day late the four-year vest over he leaves he launches something called gas it's literally like the same app sells it to Discord uh oh my gosh incredible and uh why I'm bringing him up is I remember chatting with him and you know it was probably like summer 2017 maybe maybe 2018 where he was gonna shut down TBH um his company and I remember chatting with him and and being like hey Nikita like what about I thought you mentioned you had this other app this Anonymous polling app that you're gonna launch and he's like yeah I don't know how I'm gonna launch it and he ended so he he was like calling me about how do you shut down a company or chatting with me about how to shut down a company and he ended up as like a Hail Mary launching TBH it ends up going viral and like tens of millions of people download it and ends up selling to Facebook like for tens of millions of dollars like a couple months later and it was really to your point it's like the tenacity of like sometimes you're at this point where you can either quit um or double down and as Founders it's like so lonely yeah especially as like a solo entrepreneur trying that's why I love having a co-founder because making those decisions on your own it's just a lonely place to be in and you all you're doing is like continuing to work on it until you let it die and I think entrepreneurs hate that advice of like it it only exists for as long as you make it exist and then like once you stop trying it goes away but in early stages that's really what it is nobody else is gonna make it happen for you I mean business is fragile period no matter how small you are or if you're Google size it's fragile so for example like three months ago with this whole AI wave Google was like on Red Alert code red like our business is at you know could go to zero because of Chad gbt in open AI and their stock was getting like pounded it was like down like 40 percent or 45 uh you know in 12 months and the narrative was just going against them and it's kind of like one of those moments where it's like okay like do we do we Embrace this do we brace AI or do we just like ignore it and even the point is even a trillion dollar company is fragile let alone a seat stage start startup or pre-seed startup with like two four six months of of Runway so it's very we're playing fragile games and that's just the nature of it so like you do need to have pretty tough skin if you want to like be in the game in the arena yeah and I think that's even true like at the you know series C and Beyond companies I've been at the people are what makes such a difference like I don't I don't think that's obvious from the outside it's like this giant Corporation but each team is made up of a mini CEO who's making something happen moving it Forward getting an approved hiring people so I think it's surprising how much could not happen just because of like corporate bloat but I think I think you can be an entrepreneur in a very big company as well you so you sold the company then you went to the skim to do product design why did you do that and what did you learn about newsletter businesses in that process yeah mostly I had just been like a long time reader of the scam I was in New York I wanted to be in person because I had spent three years remote and was feeling very ungrounded had never really worked with women either so the skim is like I would guess 90 women and then two female co-founders so that was mostly why I was attracted to it and then um I actually came on as product manager and got to hire a team of designers and Engineers to relaunch their mobile app subscription so that was just a cool opportunity to take their content business like it was a lot of journalists and media people working there and then bring in the first tech team and apply more of those mechanisms that I'd learned at other tech companies so um I think it was interesting being at a company with mostly women because I'd never even worked with women before and then also um a company with a lot of media and journalism people who think very differently than the tech world does so all good lessons I think I'm I'm not meant to be in that role I like working in a really technical organization with with a little more balance but it was a good learning experience again and how did you know you you weren't meant for that role because I think a lot of people are working jobs that they're kind of like yeah I think I like it I might like it like some days are good some days are bad like how do you know if something is the right fit or not I think I just wasn't feeling activated there like I like being in a company where I can be super ambitious and pursue things that are hard and that where I feel like an entrepreneur and it just didn't feel like that for me like I think media in general and this is definitely a steroid stereotype but it's more of like you go to work you do your job and then you go home unless you're like an investigative journalist or something like that um and so I was just looking for like a little more ambition and and I wanted to be working really hard in my 20s and making things happen and I just didn't feel that there but it great organization like they they've scaled this Media company in a crazy way um I think it just it didn't feel right to me I actually met the two co-founders of the skim in 2012 and they pitched me on investing um so this this was their seed round I believe yep I passed unfortunately and I passed because I remember why I passed I was like this is a really good idea makes total sense but they were just like yeah we're gonna get Oprah Winfrey and we're gonna get all these people on board and I was like you just graduated like how you like you're thinking so big and at the time um I had never met people who thought that big honestly um at the time I was like what do you mean you're gonna get Oprah Winfrey you're just gonna like call up Oprah Winfrey and she's just gonna like and then I remember and I just checked on my email I remember seeing a New York Times article that says like Oprah Winfrey is now involved with the skin in 2013. yeah they were so good at getting influencers and like really impressive people involved from the very beginning like if you look at they're real they've been on like every morning talk show possible so they were amazing at that what about them made them so good at that because that's such a key skill to know as an entrepreneur like if you're able to like make the impossible happen and bring celebrities creators press around you all the time like that just makes that turns building a startup from building a startup in hard mode to easy mode so what do you think about the founders and the team but I guess specifically the founders why do you think the founders of the skim were able to make that happen I mean I think part of it and I wasn't on the team at this time but part of it they were just super young like you said I think they had worked at NBC for a couple of years as producers built up a really good Network um had already had like more of a community there and then they were young enough to just be like yeah we can get Oprah like we're just gonna go do that and then I think once you get a few of those really big personalities on board it's kind of a flywheel effect and I remember being a user closer to 2012 and they were just the only ones talking in a very colloquial conversational voice to women but talking about serious news so I loved their newsletter just because there was no the only other way to get that kind of content was watching cable news at that time and so they had that background of cable news but then applied it to this new network and I think they would just stay up they were like best friends they would just stay up until three in the morning and write content every night so they were just passionate about it and then had a way to attract a bunch of people to that same type of model um and then now I think they have to figure out how to be a tech company which is which is a different skill set for them I think totally I mean I saw that firsthand you know I sold my last business to wework and we work with always trying to be a tech company what what is a real estate company so I always saw how did you know Adam Newman and and team whether you try to bring people together to make it more of a tech company and it's not easy the short answer is it's not easy so um that being said like you know you're seeing companies like the morning you know morning Brew um in companies like you know content businesses get great valuations the problem I think with the skim has is that I'm just checking right now but they've raised a bunch of money yeah I think that was that because um I believe morning Brew didn't raise money right or they raised like 500 000. a very yeah a small very small amount of money and and the scam I just checked has raised 28.4 million yeah so that's they have to like really perform beyond that yeah to find an acquisition so I think that's that's I think that's a business that should have been bootstrapped to be honest because oh I agree they they're the way they make money is is through ads like they could just hire an entire ads team and bring and become very wealthy off of that and and like even give employees equity and dividends and stuff like that if I'm the skim what I'm doing now is like I'm actually building like I I I removed the I stopped selling advertising basically and I just go I'm gonna go build products and partner with products yeah then we're gonna own equity in these products yep and then that's like basically the play is where we're gonna see Venture size returns is going to be in these next Generation products for women and we're just going to use the skim for distribution acquisition awareness and acquisition and that's like what I that's what that's what they should be doing yeah but it's really hard to run both a media business that's based on ads and eyeballs and a product company and you have to have people who understand how to do both and I think that's what I was trying to get out before is that the type of person who builds product is a very different organization than writing content and monetizing with ads so I think I'm trying to think of a company that does both really well maybe maybe New York New York Times is a good example but it took them a long time and I don't know how it's structured but I would imagine like the people who make the New York Times games and and stuff like that like those products like it's probably a separate division of the business yeah um so it's almost like the skim should create the skim Studios and find a CEO for this game studios um or the other idea is like you create the skin Studios or you create Studios and then you go to the skim and you say hey I'm going to give you 20 million dollars for your business and but you're gonna own 50 of you know skin Studios and it's got It's funded and stuff like that so there might it's probably an interesting acquisition Target for some people listening um yeah for sure because it's a valuable audience right quick Interruption from me if you're listening to this on Apple podcast or Spotify they're getting any value you need to come to YouTube and subscribe to the where it happens podcast YouTube channel I promise you the experience is richer more interesting so if you're getting any value just stop what you're doing open up the YouTube app go to the website and press subscribe at where it happens on YouTube and if you're watching this on YouTube and you haven't subscribed what are you doing go go press subscribe thank you enjoy the rest of the show yeah that's that's it's a very unique audience I think that's what advertisers love about it and I'm curious to see what happens with that kind of business with AI as well because it's just so easy to create content like the content they grew off of um you can almost automate that with AI now so it'll be very interesting to see how you like take ownership and authorship for Content moving forward and that kind of business yeah the other interesting thing is I just checked buzzfeed's Revenue but 2022 they had 437 million dollars of Revenue and their business is worth 85 million dollars today it's publicly traded on the NASDAQ so it's like okay BuzzFeed is bringing in that kind of Revenue like what's the skin we're really worth yeah that's why I think that if you're starting a media business bootstrap it bootstrap it as long as you can there's literally no excuse to start a media business in 2023 with Venture Capital uh unless you're using Venture Capital to like scale something like a skim Studios yes if there's like a technology a unique differentiated technology behind it it's kind of like raising money for an e-commerce startup now and you're you're like the physical product I think it's very hard to justify because you're building on top of everybody else's technology and then that's the part that scales is the technology side of things so before we get into what you're currently doing now uh with velvet you're in New York City you seem to have your pulse on like The Vibes and what things are going on in technology um what are you seeing right now that our Trends or ideas that you're kind of like wow like you know that's an interesting business there that's an interesting Trend like what's what's keeping you up at night besides your own business around Trends and ideas yeah I mean I think obviously everyone is talking about AI um and how it's going to disrupt things and I think it's pretty hard to know both from like an investment perspective and a technology perspective what matters there but for me the biggest problem is like proof of personhood like who posted this online is it a real human can you trust it and something interesting that came from the web 3 world was this idea of transacting ever everywhere with wallets and so I think there's something in between Ai and web3 wallets that allow you to like put a stamp on every single thing that goes on the internet whether it's content or a transaction or a photo of you or whatever it is um but I can't imagine we can move forward in a Safe Way without something like that which just allows you to be like this fully online digital native representative of yourself so you think there's going to be some blockchain based validator that basically checks if what someone is saying posting is human verified basically yeah I don't think it has to be blockchain though like yeah I think it's just there was a lot of uh invention that came out of the web 3 world and I would go to these hackathons last summer quite a bit and it was super cool to see how much invention was happening and everyone was just like forgetting all the rules from web2 and creating new things which was super cool but I think what a lot of them have realized in the past six months maybe just because funding have has dried up and people are very anti-crypto but you can do a lot of those things without blockchain so I expect that some of the innovations that came from there um like wallets like identity like verified credentials will just make its way into normal databases and already are what other startups that you're seeing New York or or could be anywhere are you like wow those people they've got a really good business or they're doing something right um what are some like on you know gems that you're seeing where you're kind of like tipping your hat to that yeah I would say I don't know how early they are but like reversal and Super Bass I think they're super impressive companies that saw something in the future and just created this entirely new tech stack and reality explain what those products are we're late check on pays for both of them and uses those products religiously so I'd like both of those products what are they and why are they interesting businesses yeah so um I'm probably gonna botch these a little bit but versel is basically helping you spin up servers anywhere so you shouldn't have to like go to AWS and spin all of those up yourself and deal with all the infrastructure um so it helps you deal with a serverless infrastructure reality and then Super Bass is like what we're building our entire back end on and so it replaces a lot of the services that we would otherwise have to have a team of maybe five Engineers to spin up um and like if you want to add on things like wallets like authentication um anything like that it's kind of just an integration that you turn on through Super Bass so I think in the same way that cloud computing allowed solo entrepreneurs to pop up the Versailles super based different things like that are allowing one engineer to run an entire very complicated system it's the classic picks and shovels strategy it's like you know there's all these developers they it's a gold rush in a lot of ways people are building digital products all the time how do you make it easier for them to to do their jobs yeah and it's always something I do um is whenever I see like a new trend I just I stop and think I'm like okay what is the picks and shovels opportunity here I think it's a question that a lot of us should ask ourselves so for example like with all that's happening with AI and automation um you know a lot of people's minds are going to be like oh how do I create a legal you know chat GPT or you know for lawyers um or for doctors or thinking about consumer use cases or these use cases that are really really big ideas that could either you know you're either going big or going home but I think sometimes the products with the least amount of risk are these picks and shovel businesses because you know that you just you know your job basically is like to figure out if you're mining for gold if you're a miner and you're mining for gold like what tool do you need to help mine that gold efficiently and that's your job and I think it's a stamina game as well the because I don't think anyone probably saw vercel and was like oh this is a super exciting maybe like really Niche Engineers but most people were not like this is a super exciting thing that I want to exist whereas with consumer companies I think it's easier to have that motivation because it's like everyone you talk to your mom your dad your best friend they like understand what you're building and can explain it to their friends but with infrastructure businesses you just have to know that it's the right thing and keep working on it and like he's been working on it for like almost a decade but it looks like it's been a three-year success story so I think that's really important to remember too is like you just have to keep going and eventually it's going to become something really valuable and honestly sucks to build those infrastructure businesses in some ways because you feel like an idiot for so long yeah and then one day like you start really hitting escape velocity and you're like wow I have these thousands of people who use this in their in everyday life and it's so valuable like they literally cannot mine gold without it this is awesome and then you start you know creating you know meetups are happening all across the world and there's Versailles and super based meetups and you get to show up there and they're like oh my God that's the founder of Super Bass but it takes so much time to get there with these infrastructure businesses sometimes and it's not fun to like meet someone or go on a first date and be like yeah I like running you know if it's for sure it's way cooler to be like I'm the co-founder of the skin yes and here's what totally even though the valuation of those two companies is vastly different like I think the things that people get excited about usually are not high value companies um because it's like what's relevant now not what's relevant in the future what other I mean I'm loving this hot take stuff like what other hot takes do you have that most people probably would disagree with you but you you think that you know you're on the right track with well this is very unrelated but I think remote work is a very contentious topic right now like my last company was evangelizing remote work and I was like everybody should work remote we never need to go to an office again um but I've spent most of my career as a remote worker at this point and I feel extremely ungrounded and community-less like I have to work really hard to find those things um so I think we're gonna have to invent something like either we're going back to offices at least a couple days a week or there's gonna have to be a lot of innovation in how we can engage with each other especially for junior employees like the reason I have a technical background is because I worked in an office with other people and learned from them and I just I don't think I would have gotten that virtually even with like zoom and everything we have today but at the same time I don't really want to go to an office from nine to five every single day so um for me the answer is living in a city and finding community that way but I think we're going to have kind of a crisis if people don't go back to an office at all or build a community outside of their house and when you say build a community you don't mean like a community of your team you're talking about like you're finding community in other places right well it used to be that that was your community like you made friends and met people at work and so if you don't have that or like what happens when education goes fully online and you don't even make friends in college like I think that would be kind of scary to not have connections that you like engage with in person and maybe maybe I'm just gonna be an old person at some point complaining about this but I think that would be hard here's what I hate about remote work and here's what I hate about online education it's very transactional yeah online education it's like okay I'm gonna go take this course I'm just gonna go consume these videos and now I'm educated I'm about work I'm just going to log into slack and and log into Trello or whatever and see all my to-do's that I have to do and I'm just going to go and complete the tasks yep and what's what sucks about that is that the world if the world is a more transactional place I think the world becomes a worse place because that you know you go to the Barista for your morning coffee and you're just like give me the coffee you don't really care it's not about are you order it on your phone or just do it on the app yeah yeah so the the transactional world is actually quite a scary place like at its extreme and we should be very very careful of that I think you're right that we we need to be wary of it I also think that you can build a remote team with some elements of community like we're for example like I run a remote team we've got tons of team members we're constantly throwing like in-person events where people can come and hang out and just like the goal is isn't even to like do any work the goal is just hang out and meet each other in a cool place yep so for example like we just did one in in Toronto and we had a bunch of people come and it was just like yeah let's go and have some really great food and drink wine and that was how often do you bring the whole team together like that and then like what do you spend the time on when you're in person so we do two major events per year where it's big team uh coming together and again that's like mostly like we might do like it might be a three day thing or four day thing we did one a big one two big ones last year where we did one in Bali Indonesia and one in Montreal Canada and we just try to do really crazy stuff so for example like we we literally and I I don't say this to be like a flex or anything like that but like we found this like really crazy Chateau outside Montreal this like literally Chateau and I actually talked about it on my episode on on the where it happens pod with my co-founder the otaba and a few episodes ago but the idea is basically like let's just bring people to places that are going to create memories and like I just like saw people like walking around and taking videos and like sharing it with their friends and it was just it was it was magical in a lot of ways so try to do that a couple times a year and then there's like teams kind of come together on a more regular basis but we are we are remote and I don't I personally don't want to go into the office like I just I ca I don't I don't want to and I know like Elon Musk will say like you know I'm soft or whatever and I just think that for some people remote work is the most productive form of work yeah I think I'm definitely more productive remote like I think back to the last time I was in an office full time was at Fitbit and we had these really fancy downtown San Francisco offices and we would go in there and like honestly half the day or more was I think social time thinking back compared to what remote work is where I'm like actually doing things for eight hours a day or close to it or if I'm not I'm still being super focused with my time but I haven't seen remote work I haven't been on a company at a company that's super productive at scale with remote work so I'm building a remote company also to be clear like I don't I don't want to go to an office every day either Shopify from what I understand is pretty remote um like they're mostly a remote company they started off in Ottawa which pretty random All Things Considered and then they started like having an office in Toronto and Montreal and other places but then they eventually just went remote I think what works from what I understand from them is they have teams like for example if you're on the um payments team it it'll it's remote but everyone needs to work on EST and yeah it could be in Charleston but you could be in New York or Toronto or Montreal or anywhere along that EST because I think the top that that the time zone thing also kills people in remote work like it it's soul sucking like yes like thinking about oh my God like I need to stay I need to like get off get up for my dinner and like call Tokyo because I have a team member in Tokyo right if you can't I think if you can't have you know a schedule and a routine that's really hard some people do really well with it but my perspective is that people are more productive when they time block and have a specific period that they're focusing on something and even with like EST to PST is really hard like the three hours is almost harder than Europe because it feels like you're in the same place but like someone's having dinner or going to bed when you're wrapping up your day totally I agree with the time zone thing all right Switching gears to your new your new baby tell me tell me about it and tell me about why you think uh it's gonna be big yeah so every company I've worked at I focused on this place between acquisition and Engineering so like how do you get someone into your product activate them get them to pay or do whatever you want and then retain them long term and if you can't do that you will fail as a company like if you just have a leaky bucket that gets people in and then doesn't keep them or you can't identify them um there's just no value there and there's no revenue and so we're building tools that creates the crossover between those two teams so no code acquisition on the front end so giving growth teams the ability to spin up all of these growth pages and acquire people to apps in about 10 seconds or less and then connecting that to the back end for engineering teams so engineering teams never want to touch onboarding like you have to beg Engineers to work on it because it's it's the most important part of your Tech stack it allows people to authenticate into a system and then accept payment and so we're creating an API to do that authorization and payment on the back end so it allows growth teams to experiment and do growth but engineering to trust the system how do you come up with an idea like this because like to me this feels like so I I've felt this pain by the way um on a lot of our projects that we work on but I'm just curious like how do you like how do you how to go from I'm working at the skim to building this I mean also I've worked out a lot of very consumer companies but I've worked on the technology side of all of them so like how do you get people into your system and then keep them there and it's a very technical problem always working directly with Engineers who are building the infrastructure of the company and most most companies like Airbnb for example has a platform team of hundreds who are focusing on this so you have to have a team that's building it out but there's no kind of productized solution that connects all of these pieces and makes it work there are a lot of authentication companies so like Clark is one of them off zero things like that but what you get on the front end and back end of that is not much like they're just doing that one piece of the stack and so this is taking a more horizontal approach to that and connecting all of the pieces but I spent two years trying to figure out what this company would be so it's not like it just came to be I actually started more in the web 3 space and I was really excited by wallet authentication so like I adopted a wallet started going to all these hackathons and was just amazed that my identity could travel around with me so it's like one tap to create an account one tap to pay one tap to sign for a transaction and that was just the most seamless amazing experience but you couldn't use it anywhere like other than buying NFP fees which I was in school so I didn't have money to do that so like even gaspies would like put me into debt um but I that that was a really amazing experience and it was this new design Paradigm that I hadn't seen through all my years of rebuilding onboarding over and over again um but then when I met my co-founder we realized we could just do it on normal databases that's really where the Inception came from another good framework for thinking about how to build these types of businesses is and you kind of mention it or allude to it which is you look at you pick an industry so the tech industry and then you pick you you map out all the teams that they have and then you look at how do I build up productize infrastructure business that could 50x or basically like bottle up these this team in some sort of software solution totally yeah and I think um one that I don't want to do because I just like don't like this part of the stack but I think is pretty ripe for disruption is manual sales teams like for media companies they go out and they sell an ad package to a company and then it's like this fully manual process to get them integrated with the product and it in my opinion it should just work like Google ads do but like you have to have an entire engineering org who hates working on ads building out this entire attack but I think it's kind of like it's not a fun problem to solve nobody wants to work on ads this um cool and and velvet like how's it going did you raise Venture for it tell us more yeah so I worked I was working at Chicago Ventures and so they funded the pre-seed round so I have them and a couple of other institutionals and Angels involved um so we've raised about a million dollars it's just me and my co-founder and we're trying to keep the team really lean so I think I think this is maybe another hot take a lot of early stage companies I think raise a million to five million dollars and they hire like 20 people and then you just run out of money before you get anywhere close to product Market fit or creating value um so we're just it's just gonna be the two of us until we feel like we have product Market bid or some version of it or maybe one more engineer and trying to keep it super lean in the meantime so our first product will be ready hopefully in the next couple of weeks for adoption but like we were talking about with infrastructure companies it's just really high stakes like if you mess up someone's user data one time you never get to have a customer again so it's a longer sales process a longer development process we're using superbase in bursal which is pretty Cutting Edge so there's just we have to run into all the bugs ourselves before we can offer it to other people but yeah going well always wish it was moving faster but I think with infrastructure it just it takes years to get there um I gotta head out in a couple minutes but do you have any questions or question for me um yeah I mean you've probably talked about this all day but what's like the thing this week that you're excited about in the technology world I'm I'm like a shiny object guy so like I I have like 10 you know in any given day I'm excited about like 10 different things yeah um but you're catching me on a day where I'm really excited about it's boring but you know we're having we're talking about quote-unquote boring products yeah um Automation in general and mapping out how you can automate businesses a lot better um one company I really really love is zapier and that's one of those business that probably businesses that probably seemed like super lame for a while but then like in the last I don't know probably like two years it's or two two to three years with the no code movement in 2020 yeah and then now with um the AI movement in 2022 2023 it just feels like zapier has really become like core to the internet and in the infrastructure and automation so I think uh I'm pretty just excited about where automation could lie and what you can do there what the different vertical is there um and then we're always focused on community-based products and in that whole ecosystem so how do you think about automating for example the work of a community manager how do you think about automating things uh for marketers or designers like our team like we think about you know we have on our team we have you know seven to different types of designers different Engineers web 3 Engineers AI Engineers like SEO people paid marketers like all these different people that you could think about how you can automate a lot of their work and I just think that's just a really fun place to start thinking about because people complain a little bit about I don't want all my all my work to be automated because then what am I going to do people would appreciate a lot of their like lemur type work to be automated right if they can only be doing things that like a computer couldn't do for them yeah would they be happier exactly yeah there will be problems with it but I agree do you want your team to just be like hey make a new make a new app and then it just like comes together yeah that's kind of how it works like we because we run a studio you know it's a holding company and we have a bunch of businesses in the studio so we're it's sometimes I'll just come to work and I'll be like hey I have this idea for this like automation app who wants to build it and that's cool let's go and build it like there's we're building like you know someone had an idea for a game and an AI game and uh you know I was playing it this morning and it was like wow that's pretty cool um so it is fun to what I like about what you're doing is you're very focused on a particular problem set we're really we're not focused at a particular problem set we have we're focused on a on a thesis yeah uh community-based products outperform non-community based products but if you ever start a studio it you could you know be aware of focusing on too many things yeah about Automation and a I that like each of your people could be a micro entrepreneur just like working by themselves and like trying to make one of these businesses work so that's the idea you only need that's the other thing you only need one to really work yeah totally um like to do Venture scale returns especially if you're funding it yourself yep yeah super cool well thank you so much for the conversation today no this is cool um where could people find out more about you and velvet yeah velvet is velvet.cash and my website is Emma lawler.com and all my socials are there but happy to connect anytime this has been wonderful thanks for uh thanks for coming awesome talk to you soon bye

Title: How Personalization Algorithms Impact Community Engagement  (With Mad Realities)
Published: 2023-06-27 14:00:39 UTC
Description:
Advanced personalization algorithms are impacting shared experiences.

While these algorithms excel at tailoring content to individual preferences, they also contribute to a sense of disconnection and fragmentation.

The very essence of shared experiences, which bring people together and foster communities around content, becomes further diluted.

We explore the consequences of this phenomenon, shedding light on the importance of creating spaces that unite people and encourage collective engagement.

when you have such good personalization algorithms it is even more disjointed the concept of shared experiences goes away even further everything is so specific to you we're lacking those places that bring people together and create more shared experiences for communities around content

Title: TikTok, Reels, or Shorts: Which Is Best? (With Mad Realities)
Published: 2023-06-26 14:00:25 UTC
Description:
n the ever-evolving landscape of social media, the question arises: where should your focus lie?

- TikTok?
- Instagram Reels?
- Or YouTube Shorts?

The answer is simple: diversify your distribution.

By spreading your content across multiple platforms, you minimize the risk of being tied to a single platform's fate.

Don't limit yourself to one platform. Harness the potential of TikTok, Reels, and YouTube Shorts to reach wider audiences, engage with communities, and solidify your content empire.

should people be focusing on Tick Tock or should they be focusing on reels or should they be focusing on YouTube shorts diversify your distribution because you never know what's going to happen and you don't want to be able to hold into one platform but I would say also the effect of having single accounts that we learned from our Tick Tock shows applies to shows on Instagram as well in the last couple years it's been pretty hard for people to grow Instagram accounts it's cool to see how again people really gravitate towards these ideas of shows the Creator is the account and they have many channels to them which is a little bit more like the YouTube model it's definitely really interesting seeing that happen on builds as well

what's really interesting about midday squares is when you buy a midday square at the back of the package like you see the founders faces they're a Creator born brand from the start in their DNA I don't think there's anybody that comes even close to them in terms of Storytelling in an organic way and knowing the end consumer and understanding the context of the platforms they invest heavily into their content they know that it's something that's going to drive the business people see their content and go oh what is this and they back it up with having a good product and I think that those two things together are a recipe for some real damage and that's what people should be looking at

[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you all right case from the show hello thanks for having me man so explain to people who you are because I came across your Instagram people were just sharing your posts again and again and again and I was like I need to reach out to this guy and try to understand who he is and how he's doing this and and I just want to crawl in your brain a bit so yeah for those who don't know who case Kenny is you know please please explain I mean I would say Instagram is like a really small part of what I do it's a way that a lot of people find me and kind of get into my proverbial funnel but it's really a small part of what I do I'd say the joke that I say is that I share my feelings for a living that's the like brand and it comes to life in many different ways for one I'm a podcaster I've been podcasting since 2014 I host a podcast on SiriusXM called new mindset who dis it's all things mindfulness so really my passion in life and the way that I bring that to life and product and content and the podcast and books and in writing um it's it's through the lens of mindfulness that's really my and bringing mindfulness by my own definition to life in different relatable ways I've created products that are in Target in Walmart bringing mindfulness to life in fun ways I have in Candle lines I've created journaling lines I do a lot in music with artists in dance music with music and mindfulness so really I'm just very passionate about the topic of mindfulness and I'm privileged to be able to do it for a living and talk and share my feelings for a living Instagram just being a way to bring my idea of mindfulness to life in small consumable ways you know grateful that people like to really share that content but for me it all started with the podcast frankly that's like the you know the Center of My Universe it's it's where I create all my original content it's where I then decide to create products and books from it um yeah that that's pretty much it I'm 35. um you know just for normal guy reflecting on life through the lens of mindfulness and that in effect has turned me into an author first and then I'd say an entrepreneur a close so it's interesting that you said that you started with the podcast because a lot of people ask me should I start a podcast and I'm always kind of like if you don't have an audience like don't honestly yeah because it's so hard to get there's no Discovery built in within podcasting like how were you able to break through in the podcasting world without having an audience uh yeah I I hate to say I'm the exception but it your advice is is true it's very difficult right most of the you know podcasts nowadays that are started are started by people with big followings or her moving their following from an email list or something something like that it's and that's obviously the way to do it uh I started podcasting in 2014 on a different podcast and then I started new mindset who does in 2018 at the time I think I had like 10 000 followers the grammar so now I'm at like half a million so there's is the growth there um I don't know I mean I I did a lot of different things over the years I've grown large email lists like I was building an email newsletter at the same time like morning Brew was I was close with those those guys so like I learned a lot about like how to build a brand you know for me I think podcasting in a serious way in 2018 did give me a little bit of an advantage it was a little bit before kind of the the Heyday that we're in now um and then combine that with um uh you know my email list but really the way that my social came about was I created the podcast it did really well I remember the first month it did 56 000 downloads with no social media following and that doesn't sound like a lot but for a no-name podcaster to start with that in a month it puts you in you know a category of being successful and from there you know I I podcast for about a year and I was like oh this is really interesting like it's doing well then it was a hundred thousand a month 200 300 000 a month I was like I should I should monetize this but I didn't want to do ads so I was like what can I create for my audience that I I can sell to in a really authentic way landed on creating a journal actually I don't know if you know Austin from morning Brew is actually he put something in my head and suggested that and I ended up doing it but when I started to create the journals and I sold them and they started to do really well I started to put a lot of AD spend into it and in effect started to really create this you know the business did seven figures um and in the first eight months it did really really well but then I used that momentum to pour it back into the podcast so the podcast quickly became part of the e-commerce marketing cycle um and that kind of helped explode the podcast as well all my fulfillment emails all the follow-up emails all the Loyalty emails within my funnel pointed people back to the podcast so it became this really nice cycle of organic content created journal from it Market the journal with paid ads push people back to the podcast pushing the social and then it became this thing um and ever since it's become a really organic way for me to create content on the podcast see what people react to create a book from it create a product from it and then just go from there so really nice like unforced cycle so I wanna I actually want to go deeper into this and nerd out a bit so what you're describing is is a flywheel basically it's a crater flywheel which means that you know if you spend more money on ads you're gonna sell more uh of the journal which is going to get more podcasts um listens which is gonna you know sell more journals and get more podcasts you know and sort of this live that keeps going and that's like the Holy Grail of what every Crea you know they're calling now creatorpreneurs which are like creators plus entrepreneurs yeah um wants to be at so my question to you is could you talk more about like what your ads look like what platforms you used and then more specifically like how were you actually driving people to the podcast and then on the podcast like what experience like just like walk me through the whole flywheel in like one level deeper yeah yeah for sure so I mean the lowest level of course was the podcast I've been doing it twice a week for five years I just hit episode 500. it's my thing it's it's ingrained in my routine twice a week and then pretty much 24 7 because I'm always thinking of content and I don't do guests on the podcast so it's all just like case Kenny's of the day um so yeah so let's just talk about that bro sorry to interrupt you let's talk about that for a second thoughts of the day like you talked about you know feelings you know how did you come up with the idea for the podcast and what were you trying to accomplish in terms of the content um I honestly came from a really like self self-compassionate place like I worked in advertising for 11 years before I started doing this in Chicago with a bunch of the you know tier one agencies and then an advertising technology sales I led a sales team in Chicago when I was about to turn 30 um I was basically like you know called a quarter life crisis whatever you want to call it break up and I was traveling a lot for the job I was based in Chicago I was going to like Toledo and Columbus and St Louis and Kansas City no disrespect to those cities of course but it was just like little plane to hear to rent the car to here and I was just like man what would happen if 20 years from now I looked back and was like I never questioned anything I never questioned who I was dating what I was doing the goals I had so on and so forth so I created the podcast from a pretty genuine place of wanting to challenge myself I'm a pretty type a person and the fact that I didn't have great answers to some pretty simple questions of who am I what do I want so on and so forth I was like let me start a podcast in 2018 a little less cliche than the straight white guy starts a podcast in 2023 so it was a little more vulnerable and I saw it as a you know platform to just push myself and that was it and that was it and I I started from that place and I'd been riding online in different forms you know for years and you know I was buddies with Cole and you know and you know had been in the space for a while like I understood things but I saw it as a means to you know kind of just help myself and then from there yeah it just became this thing where I realized what I was doing I was practicing mindfulness you know the art of introspection the art of radical honesty and it just became a really simple thing where I would just ask myself questions and answer them for myself and for other people and then you know the podcast started to grow then I started to do a lot of dating content through the lens of mindfulness not like how to text someone or anything like that but through the lens of mindfulness and that's what really blew up the podcast from a Content perspective um and then yeah it became really easy because I don't do guests um typically I mean I have but it's typically me just you know hey here's something I saw the other day here's a tick tock that said don't catch feelings and I was like that's stupid we should catch feelings and I would just react to stuff Through My Lens um and I really I don't call myself an expert or a guru it's really not my thing I'm not a licensed therapist of course so just try to keep it real and simple and it's just you know it's easy it's easy to do 500 episodes when it helps you and it helps me it's my therapy so I've been doing it for five years and then year four Sirius XM came along and bought up the distribution rights in the advertising rights so then it became this this big thing but to answer your question that's kind of where it came from so that's the podcast and so that's part one of of the flywheel yep and you from your podcast are you driving people somewhere I mean so now yeah I always drive to New mindsetwoodist.com which links all my journals all my book uh different products that I'm involved in obviously when I first started um it was just one Journal at the new mindset Journal which I I created in January 2020 I launched on Indiegogo in 2020 January 2020 raised 37 39 000 did not do well I actually lost money on that between agency expenses I hired an agency to help me 3pl expenses manufacturing expenses just didn't really know what I was doing it is what it is so I lost you know a couple Grand on it then covid hit and I had fulfilled the initial cohort of people who bought it on Indiegogo and I had like 2 000 journals left over I was like oh man these are burning a hole in my pocket with my my 3pl and Cicero Illinois I've got to get rid of these so I started posting on Instagram just you know and at that time I had I don't know maybe 50 000 followers or something um and it's luck Randomness timing positioning something happened where they just started to sell and I remember at that point having Shopify notifications turned on on my phone was getting a little ping I was like oh this is this is crazy people are actually buying this and then I started to run ads and ads were uh really still cruising and especially during during covid the early part of covid really cruising so I started to put money into it and in the first um 18 months it did about five and a half million and that's not a number Flex I learned a lot I messed up a lot I really screwed up inventory um you know my my p l was all over the place but it kind of took off and then when you say Ad you're talking Facebook ads yeah I'm talking I'm talking Facebook Tick Tock did a little search um but but principally Facebook meta meta right and like what did the ad copy say like that you know because it was wild it was so silly like every marketer would tell you it wouldn't work my my initial ads were static Carousel images of text messages that someone might send after standing up for themselves or affirmations to remind them of themselves and then the final Carousel would be a picture of the of the uh Journal but it was very incongruent like it was text messages for a printed Journal it's very confusing but it was still it was cruising at like a five times row as on it um and it worked really well obviously you know since a lot has happened in advertising and iOS and all that jazz a lot has changed and has really you know forced me um and my my fellow Ecom compatriots to get really good with creative but frankly I I really don't spend that much on ads anymore you know luckily so since since then two three years ago um things have taken off organically for me where you know my books on Amazon on them on Amazon now about two years in I started selling on Amazon and let that ecosystem really boost everything but in the beginning the ads were really simple didn't really know what I was doing but uh they work I'm on your website right now and new mindset who diss join a community of 300 000 journalers um and there's a bunch of you know you can shop the best sellers and stuff like that when you buy the book so let's just say someone comes in from you know an ad a Facebook ad yeah they buy they buy the journal sorry not the book they buy the journal they make that a part of their habit how do they hear about the podcast like what's that flow look like yeah twofold for one there's a page in the journal that actually promotes the podcast and drives people there um so you're actually going to be reminded of it in the book the second of course is the Fulfillment process and the and the drip flow through I use clavio um through through the actual fulfillment process itself the first email you'll get when you confirm your Journal is hey while you wait why don't you get ready with some mindset and then it points to the points to the the podcast I've also in the past I've also been somewhat clever I suppose but I I drip some affiliate emails affiliate links into the email specifically with some of the um the online therapy groups that pay pretty large CPAs there so also while you wait why don't you start with therapy so that's also worked pretty well but um yeah the email email has been a big uh way to way to promote it so that that's smart on a lot of a lot of levels so first I don't think enough people do this where they have a low ticket item that they sell via paid ads mostly and then put them in a drip campaign that ultimately leads them to audience building community building and affiliate deals that are related like value add affiliate deals to help basically you know get your return on ad spend up yeah like people the like the Baseline is like oh I'm just gonna like I'm just gonna create an ad I'm gonna sell it I'm gonna sell my product and hopefully again and get an email and Mark to them in the future but there's so much more you can do yeah I mean that's my exact I mean every additional listener on the podcast because I have programmatic ads in the podcast is money in my pocket so any any Link in an email should benefit the economics of the business that I've built in a healthy way I've also I also have like Amazon Affiliates in there because I sell a lot of my products on Amazon so you know there's a lot of different ways to make money from from one click that goes beyond the the purchase the actual item that comes from that that they bought and then the other important piece I think is just like the the product itself helps the podcast right like have building a product that basically funnels into you're like double dipping and then triple dipping on like all levels basically yeah I mean it it it's really beneficial because I mean for one you know I designed the journals with a certain aesthetic it's meant to be shared like I like a lot of the quotes that I post on Instagram come from the journal and vice versa where people are just incentivized to get their phone out take it and share it and that drives people to Social and that drives people further back to the podcast so um you know it works really well um and then I I wrote a book this past year that was not a journal that was not like a quote product it was a book book um and that has really helped as well just like really just creating a a line of products from from entry to you know to wherever people want to go that benefits their style whether it's journaling or reading um or I've because I have audio books as well so it's you know it sounds a lot more strategic than I think it it was it just to me it just just it was like duh which is what I do um but you know it's been it's been great and you know having the support of like serious for the podcast also like I used to sell my own ads on it and stuff and that was really complicated but like bringing someone else on board who can do it at scale it's a dangerous game because there are a lot of ads in my podcast and it is rather short which I don't particularly like but you know it is what it is when you're a capitalist trying to make money off a podcast um but you know all the things move together and I try to be really specific about the advertisers that I work with and you know it's not just throwing money the book why write a book you know it just seems hard it's not hard when you have a podcast because I could just I just go to my podcast I sort my top listings and I'm like huh is there a pattern here yes let me write a book from my top podcast and I've already written all the podcasts like the podcasts are written with very detailed outlines I just take that line turn it into a book I I don't think there'll ever be a point where I write a book from zero from scratch it's always built from analytics things I've talked about things that people react well to so you talk about a cycle there furthermore I mean I'm an author like that that is who I am I don't I love being an entrepreneur I love creating products but you know my heart and my soul is is the art of the content speaking it's writing it's it's creating ideas so I you know I have my next book lined up which will release a year and a half from now that is just part two of that seemingly so from a media standpoint it's also easier in my experience to get traction from a book I was on The Today Show two weeks ago um which is a pretty unique opportunity and it was a five minute segment on me and the book um media likes to cover books especially when there's like a a nice meaty promise to it so I think people are ready for the book and you know for me uh writing a book is also about distribution like I distribute the book exclusively on Amazon which pushes to my other Amazon products which are my journals and it just it just brings in new people who want a book that aren't journalers or journalers who want to read and it just creates a nice cycle so I I just I love what you're building I I love it so much because like I I see it and you've got the flywheel going I also see it I'm kind of like well there's so much more you probably can do here and I'm curious if you feel the same way like do you look at it and you're like well like I'm just gonna you know maybe write a book every year continue doing the Pod um or am I like no no I want to build like you know you're wearing a mad happy hat like no I want to build like a mad happy level brand here and build something extraordinary in terms of size I mean my real aspiration is to build something bigger than case Kenny like right now I'm attached to my name and that's a as a privilege of course to be able to do that I mean very few people are able to make a living from their name by writing very especially if you have such a cool name like case Kenny like case you know my name is Greg Eisenberg it's just not it doesn't have the same like flow to it yeah you know maybe I was born for this who knows but thank thank my parents for that you know my realization is build something bigger than me I'll tell you two things that I'm working on to that effect the first thing is actually somewhat inspired by mad happy um it's called 216 Social Club if you go to 216socialclub.com it's basically my thing it's like there's a lot of um great uh apparel Brands communities that are built around the idea of you know evangelizing conversations around mental health I think that's great I like to build really practical simple things Brands Services Etc 216 is a number that's always been close to me long story there but I I take time every day at 2 16 P.M to do nothing to practice Stillness forgiveness gratitude anything I can get my hands on or literally just stare at a wall let's prove to myself that I'm capable of being mindful so I launched that the other month um still trying to figure it out really don't know what I'm doing but I think that's got some real likes to it about bringing mindfulness into culture through merchandise and then through larger things but the idea of uniting people around a time of day I think is pretty interesting and and pretty unique I have a small large SMS list that every day at 2 16 I send out a text so every day at 216 people are thinking about either myself or what I represent in some way that's not a big Revenue business for me at all in fact it's very very tiny but I think the idea has some legs to it that I could build a community around people who want to practice mindfulness in practical ways not just talk about mindfulness and how great it is to be mindful but to actually do it in cool ways I think that's got some some legs to it so that's something that needs some work I kind of just launched it and let it sit hopefully you'll be seeing more of that let's let's jam on this for a second so first of all I love this besides from like the design the name is so good because it brings it back to the ritual of 216. people often ask me what makes a good Community person and I always say if you can throw a good party you cool yeah you know you are a good Community person and when you think about building a you know creating a party what do you what do you think of do you think of like what is the purpose of the party what is the food what is the music you know who am I inviting how are they showing up um what time what time are they leaving like how do I think about surprising and Delight throughout the night so that they're never bored like maybe there's like I don't know maybe like um a special DJ comes at this hour or live music you know just like keep keep keep surprising and the most important piece of that whole pie is really uh it's really just the the mission and the rituals if you you know the purpose and the ritual and ritual here you have a very strong purpose and rituals so I think you're like underselling yourself a little bit when you're like yeah I don't know really what I'm doing because it's like you have a great purpose slash Mission and rituals um the question for you really is if this scales to 10 million people like what do you want that text group to look like because when I'm on the website it says one of the main value propositions is our focus is community your purchase gets you added to our daily mindfulness text group like what's your vision for the community quick Interruption from me if you're listening to this on Apple podcast or Spotify or getting any value you need to come to YouTube and subscribe to the where it happens podcast YouTube channel I promise you the experience is richer more interesting so if you're getting any value just stop what you're doing open up the YouTube app go to the website and press subscribe at where it happens on YouTube and if you're watching this on YouTube and you haven't subscribed what are you doing go go press subscribe thank you enjoy the rest of the show yeah I don't know I think that that's where I'm I'm still circling that because you know I think a lot of people want to build community for community's sake I actually want it to be beneficial because I've had the privilege of building a community but I want it to be very practical and I wanted to benefit the community obviously I want it to be a marketing distribution for myself but I truly want it to be a source of ideas for people to practice mindfulness uh in in relatable ways at scale um my my second ambition that's closely related to that because again I like I'm very into the idea of mindfulness and culture you see culture grab onto mental health in recent years at an accelerated rate I think I think mindfulness soon has an upcoming cultural moment that is going to be defined by its practicality not it's woo-ness not its fairy tale rainbow-ness but it's but it's hey here's how we're actually going to do it we're not just going to talk about it the second thing that I do a lot in that I I'm excited for the future of his music as well so one of the things for 216 is Festival daytime festivals right everyone complains about you know going to the club to listen to good music but you can listen to good music during the day but um I do a lot in music I work with a lot of big name dance artists I don't know if you're a dance music fan but folks like Martin Garrix and Griffin these guys that I've worked with where basically we team up and they'll create a dance music set like a 40-minute set and I'll come in and interludes and drop a little bit of mindfulness um it's great for for walking working out it's great for people who aren't good at using calm or headspace and want energizing movement sweat heartbeat you know 126 bpms in their life so one of the things that I'm working on is like almost it's almost like a a mindful uh record label um where I'm I'm pushing that angle of my influence that's more of just a thing that I'm interested in but it will all come together in a way with community and mindfulness and culture points um one of the things that I did this past year is I released a collab with what do you mean if you know those guys in Ben and crew they obviously they understand the game Space they understand the card game space and they saw a real opportunity to bring mindfulness into like a gamified way or um a habit way so basically I built them out of 365 Day card deck of little mindful things you could do every day got in a Target in Walmart so just different cultural points and I'm excited to see what the next one is but I think the idea of of habit and ritual and engaging with mindfulness in a practical way is really what's going to give it its moments so blabbing but that's kind of what I'm excited about and you're like is this a broadcast text message that you're sending or is it like an actual text group uh no it's with Community the text platform got it got it cool and and just can you explain Community just for folks who don't know what that is yeah Community is the one that you knew about but didn't know about back a couple years ago when all those celebrities started sharing their numbers on in Social social media it was through Community which is basically a SMS platform that's a little bit more approachable than using like an attentive or a clavio for texting which can get out of hand pricing Wise It's a little bit they group it based on how many subscribers you have rather than text sent um but it feels a little bit more personal like it literally looks like a text it is a text they can they can message me I can respond back if I'm so inclined but it's got all the analytics and segmentation and you can send people texts on their birthday and by City And I think different demographic information if you want but um for me it was it was you know wanting to choose something that was as close to an actual you know homey text group as possible without you know turning it into a daily marketing text there was this uh there was this guy who I met on Twitter he actually gave me a like 15 or 20 minute meditation Zoom thing um you know during Peak covid and his Twitter account I'm blanking on his name but I think his name's like Kenji or something but he his Twitter account is like he tweets like every day you probably should be drinking water right now and it's this like reminder hey you need you should be drinking water and it's a similar thing to what you're doing with 216 which is there's these things that we know we should be doing but we end up forgetting or life gets in the way and you know it's so fast-paced life today so I think there's probably a set of Brands community-based brands that you can create um around not just meditation but imagine like a water company which is um which employs a similar model so I think I think there's something here around the daily ritual 216 do this every day that relates to the product again that's another fly but like you're building another flywheel 100 have you started any have you started it it's funny it's like you're the non-flywheel flywheel guy I'm like damn it again I did it again oh as you can um do you have you started any paid ads or any marketing or you're just sort of testing the business out now I'm testing the waters for the vulnerable answer of I don't know what I'm doing in apparel like I know how to manufacture a journal I know exactly who to go to I know my cogs I know exactly how to make it real sweet and nice I don't know the first thing about building an apparel brand what I should be paying I'm Drop Shipping it right now and I'm fine with that because I didn't want to drop 100 Grand on something that might not do well that you know I just don't know what I'm doing so uh it's kind of a wait and see reaction I've got a phase two drop coming with new designs which I wanna I want two or three drops under my belt before I decide that I really want to go scale at it with talking to manufacturers and everything so that's the real answer so no paid ads or anything like that behind it now so what do you need what do you need to make this big like if I you know let's just jam on this a little bit like do you is it you're missing like a apparel partner in this business is it you're missing um a Creator to be a part of this business like what are the pieces that you're missing to help scale this uh yeah I think it's twofold I think it's an apparel partner for one to make so so we could really figure out the price point like I was really inspired by siegelman Stables which I'm sure you're familiar with with their story of like creating a a luxury product out of something that isn't necessarily a luxury product and that's what they stand for for me creating a luxury product on mindfulness space feels a little disingenuous to like price a hat at 70 or something like that feels feels a little bit wrong for trying to make mindfulness more approachable at scale but I really need to know what I what I stand for price wise right now I you know I've got to sell hoodies for you know 70 bucks because my Drop Shipping price is 40. like we're not making a lot of money here of course um so the first point is working with someone like that that can help uh you know educate and and scale the second I think is um yeah it's along the the Creator lines um I I don't think a cold paid ad strategy is going to get this where it needs to go I think it needs to be organic I think it needs to be Community Driven I hate to say it I think it might need to be like celebrity driven in a sense some some real taste makers getting it wearing it um creating the the cool factor I always ironically say like I don't like the word cool but I also do because I want mindfulness to be cool I want it to be imbued in cultural moments and I think you know some folks that are um at a high tier of celebrities uh celebrity uh could help that so I think somewhere in the mix there is really what's gonna gonna push it so that's the question is like do you partner with like a CAA or someone like that or or like an individual Creator or do you just like reach out to like cold DM or get warm intros to different celebs and just do it yourself yeah uh I mean I'm a I'm a lone wolf I always tend to do that I think Kong myself out on my own BS right now I just got a lot going on and I need to I need to figure out a priority but I've always done well of you know sending certain people product and things like that I think that's the next step or bringing someone on you know I've had many chats with you know some investment groups and folks like that that I keep close and they're always like yeah let's Loop in let's let's raise some capital and I've always been like I don't want to do that why would you do that like why would you never I've never been inclined to ever raise to be honest at this point yet I mean even even writing books like I've I've know I've had so many meetings with Publishers the big five and every time just the idea of giving away my IP for a quick payday makes me really sad so I've always been a little bit of a glutton for punishment and doing things myself with my own capital and and just kind of going the way but you know I think for this I I need I need a uh energy that comes from a second drop where I'm like I really like these designs like the first designs were cool like I think what's really cool is what it stands for but I need some designs that really speak to it and I've got a great designer who's working on some now so I think after that's dropped I'll have some uh some better Direction I don't know man because I'm I'm looking at the website and I'm looking at the designs and like you know I run a design agency around multiple design agencies you like them and I'm looking at this and I'm like this is sick cool man this is really really exciting I would love to keep chatting with you about it I mean it's something that I'm like really excited for you know so it's so funny like even when I first got into journaling I was like man a little bit of imposter syndrome like the people really need another journal and I feel like I still have a little bit of that where I don't have the like let's do this like let's dedicate some serious time and resources to it just yet um I just need to find that on switch I know it's a cool idea because I talk about the number 216 all the time on the podcast so I'm like I love the the topic of it and people seem to really resonate with it gotta hit go you know before before someone swoops in and you know takes the idea with another time you know the 116 Social Club well I think okay few things so one is around the journal and competition my my thesis is that every Community every every well-oiled Community can actually have a community a journal so if we go back to how we Define a community before which is like purpose slash Mission and rituals yep the rituals piece is the journal in a lot of ways and of course some communities lend itself way better to having a journal obviously you know yours is like beautiful but I think one for you that along the same line so I'm working with a large men's fitness brand um they do really good work they're they're pretty large not gym shark smaller than gymshark but I'm developing a journal for the gym for them that instead of scrolling on your phone like we all do between sets which is ridiculous like we can't take an hour off our phone it's we're going analog in the gym and we're not necessarily writing answers in this journal that I'm creating for them but it's a workout tracker you're tracking your workout and then it's got Journal prompts so in between sets when you're huffing and puffing and you're resting you're thinking through these things so it's bringing mindfulness into the gym and their Community is just rabid for that kind of stuff I think it's going to crush it when we release it but I totally agree I make a good living also from Consulting for brands that want to create this type of product for their Community I think Fitness is a is a great uh Community for that kind of thing so just agreeing with what you're saying what other verticals or spaces do you think a journal could do well in uh yeah I don't know I've had the the Fitness One Circle for a long time obviously it just lends itself so perfectly people are wanting to improve themselves um I mean I think the one that I haven't seen anyone do great just yet because they always turn it into a freaking productivity journal and it drives me crazy as business professionals I can't think of a more stressed out group of people than sales people for instance I used to run a sales team a technology at a technology company you want to talk about being stressed out and hating yourself there you go so I think a journal offer a either very specific group of people sales people Executives whatever I think would would crush it I'm sure it exists in different forms I've just never seen it the way that I like journaling which is a mix of prompted and unprompted so a lot of journals out there that just they stress me out more than they help me they're like do this do that come back at this time measure yourself on this and I'm like I feel even worse about myself now so somewhere in between and that's marketed in a cool way I think would kill it there yeah I think uh it's an interesting lesson because we all you know product Builders were always kind of like well I don't want to go and build something in this space because there's too much competition but it's kind of like well if you have this devout Community as long as you like purpose build the product for that Community like it doesn't make a difference that there's thousands of competitors I used to be really bad at that thought process I used to always talk myself out because I'm like it already exists why would I build it and I remember very specifically I don't think I've ever told Austin this but Mr Austin for morning Brew I was in a conference room at my old job talking to him like I honestly asked him I was like give me some life advice he was like oh like why don't you create a journal and my immediate reaction was why would I create a journal Tim Ferriss has a journal everyone has a journal and I remember leaving that and being so frustrated with myself or like having that be my knee-jerk reaction that I just then went and spent the next like five months and created it and sold it so I think agreed to your point if you have a community you could definitely build a product for them I think journals are great but you know if you build a custom for a community that you know well and that trust you I think it'll work long way and then you have to ask yourself like Tim Ferriss literally thought about wow should I should I create a journal right now and it's like 2015. like in 2015 or whatever it was like it was competitive then and Tim Ferriss is you know he's not a dumb guy like the guy knows what he's you know knows what he's talking about and understands competition really well and doesn't launch a lot of products either so I think uh yeah I think a lot of Founders especially this whole like solopreneur movement I think a lot of people are gonna see different spaces see products in the spaces and then just like turn away when they really shouldn't be turning away they should just be like you know I I say like find your super Niche like don't find your Niche find your super Niche and go to this like smaller Niche create something purpose built and don't worry that there might be a hundred more general purpose competitors out there yeah and I mean I learned a lot so when I first launched the new mindset Journal which was like my base Journal like now looking back I'm more proud of what I've built since because I've learned a lot but when I first launched that journal my my marketing for it was here's a journal to help you be happier and it didn't do well right it didn't do well um because the promise was so vague it's like I don't have time to be happier I've got bigger problems I got bigger fish to fry the moment that I pivoted The Branding from here's a journal to help you be happy or whatever to here's a journal to help you get over a breakup because all the prompts were actually more geared towards like forgiveness that that's a more obviously emotionally triggering entry point that was when things really started to blow up healing you know not not in like not we're not like you know obviously taking advantage of people's emotions here but finding the most palpable concrete triggering entry point to get people in that is what I was always done wonders for for these types of products and I think in the past I thought a little too high level yeah happiness confidence these kinds of things as opposed to like the sticky points that really get people in and then you can go broad with some of the things but yeah when it's so competitive and everyone has a journal for happiness we gotta we gotta go a layer deeper and I think that's what's really helped um and my last book my last book is basically it's called that's bold of you it's basically a book about becoming your best self I mean it could not be a more basic of a self-help Topic in the world but the whole concept was if you've ever been called crazy uh loud too loud too quiet too difficult these things that particularly a lot of my audience which are women have been called that was the entry point and that was the oh yes definitely you know poke me to get into helping reinvent yourself that is what is done Wonder so obviously this is just marketing stuff but it's the little things that that matter as far as like what is the problem you're solving or what is the trigger point that you're addressing and I I learned that over time of course to get as specific as you can and then serve that group of people and then open them up wider and it's worked really well yeah and and really just I like your example around showing examples like here's examples of you know how to get over a breakup how to get over this asking people these like rhetorical questions like have you ever been called too difficult and you know via your audience that you've built that like that's the number one podcast in the last 90 days you're like of course I know so it's using that's why I always say like the biggest like building a community-based product is building a startup on easy mode basically in a lot of ways because you get to you get to learn from your audience and your community what they want their likes and dislikes and then you just feed it back to them yeah and 100 yeah yes yeah and that's why back to the beginning that's why I'll always do the podcast even if I shut it down and don't make money or it dies because podcasting is difficult you've always got to be up leveling up your game otherwise your audience slowly declines but I'll always do it because it's a great way for one to give me ideas and two to to react to whoever is listening and judge their reactions so that it can go out and build different things so I'm not building an Assa in a silo I'm not building for a headline I'm not building something that sounds good I'm actually building something that people want it's easier said than done um sometimes people say they want one thing but don't uh I've also learned so you know somewhere in between is the balance if people want to build their own their own Empire their own media Empire like you've built what advice do you have for them to get started well I mean I think the cliche one has built something that you would use and that you will use because again I'm very incentivized to continue to create and build and do content because every single time I do it helps me I wouldn't be doing this for five years if it didn't help me I would run out of gas 100 I mean if you look at podcasting it's like the average podcast ends after like 10 episodes because it's very difficult to do same with Brands how many people make a living from their brand very few what's the average revenue of a small SMB I don't know 40 Grand or something it's very small you got to find something that you'll stick through when things aren't going well I remember when I when iOS 14 14 5 would ever hit and all of a sudden my ads stopped working I was like oh well I guess we had a good run I guess that was it but no I didn't say that because I was like I love this material I'll take a income hit for a little bit here while I figure things out but you know I kept going because I had that reason so I'd say for one have a why I know it's cliche but you need to have a y you need to build something that helps you I really do think that's important and then I don't know I'd say from there you know distribution is everything um and I'm not just talking about rented Distribution on Instagram and Tick Tock because that can be taken away in a flash of a moment so I'll focus on the tried and true the email and I I think SMS is of course having its moment as well open rates response rates on SMS or Bonkers um so I try to try to build something there and then I think also like I also do a fair amount a fair amount of retail I think retail is having its comeback moment for all the econ boys and all the focus there I think having a retail wholesale strategy really helps mitigate a little bit of the the risk of what happens when your ads or your your online community isn't as responsive as it used to be so somewhere in between there of Y plus distribution plus a balance of retail and e-commerce strategies will probably be well served I like them in um I gotta head out in a minute but you you have any uh do you have any questions for me I I like I'd love to continue jamming on 216 with you it was actually I actually haven't thought about that in like two weeks because I've been so uh head down on some other stuff but um what are your thoughts on that what do you think would be like a next what what proof points would you look for when you're first building something like that that said okay let's let's pour some gas on this like what do you look for metrics wise or Vibes wise or somewhere between one of the first things I would do if I was running 216 or 216 was a client to play checkout would be I have this thesis that every e-commerce store should have free and paid products so for example like if you go to You Know Jack Butcher of course yeah yeah visualize value so I'm pulling up his website right now so if you go to his uh merch page he's got like hoodies for sale for like 50 bucks and Co and uh coffee mugs and hats and stuff like that but he's also got for zero dollars you can get a visualized value wallpaper um for your phone um or if you go to his courses you can buy his courses there's a course for a dollar there's a course for 99 there's also something called daily manifest which is kind of I don't know if you've played with it but it's it's kind of like a a habit tracking app slash Journal that's a digital asset that's zero dollars and you you might look at it and be like why is he doing that um I think that he's this is brilliant because what he's doing and he's using Shopify to power all this is once you add it to cart and you check out he's getting that email address and then all of a sudden you've been onboarded into the visualize Value World like if you're gonna use one of his like you know graphs as your mobile wallpaper like you're looking at it every day like that's high value and you you might you know over time be way more likely to buy some of his products or services so one thing I would do if I were you is I'm not sure I'm not convinced that buying the product puts you into the tax Community like to me the text Community is something that you give away for free that you ultimately nurture them yeah and you have a set of free products that you start selling on your eCommerce store and you as you're doing you continue to double down on your paid products but your set of free products is all about building the community and nurturing the community your set of paid products is actually to it's actually more word of mouth than anything you know in the beginning of this call we talked about mad happy your hat that you're wearing you get to go out in the world order a tea out you know let's say You're going or go out for dinner and people are gonna see that you're wearing that hat so they might be more likely to to buy that product or if a celebrity wears it or an influencer or whatever so I think I I see physical products as identity reinforcing and word of mouth and I see digital products as a way to nurture through community and that would be my biggest piece of feedback for you to chew on is thinking about free different than paid thank you I appreciate that yeah I actually really like that I'm a I love a good nurture I really do I love a good proving it like don't just like buy a product just I'll prove it to you I'll prove why why it's valuable and my SMS list has always been one that's been for free and then I would just send out some of my best thoughts and it always felt very nice and very inclusive and then the people who got it got it and bought my product as a result and it felt like a very unfair forced you know marketing Journey um so I'll definitely give that some thought I appreciate that my pleasure man uh it's been it's been fun jamming I'll see you in Miami yeah man yeah let's link up when uh when you're back in town that'd be great sounds good all right thanks all right

Title: Why Going Viral Online Can Be Bad For Your Brand, Explains JT Barnett (BarnettX & CreatorX)
Published: 2023-06-17 14:00:32 UTC
Description:
There’s a lot of misconceptions surrounding viral content and its impact on your business.

Despite the appeal of going viral on social media and reaching millions of views, it can actually be detrimental to your brand. Especially if you go viral for something unrelated to your core audience.

A smaller audience of more loyal and engaged followers, is worth a lot more than a large audience who aren’t your number one fans.

Focus on nurturing lasting relationships with your community, and you’ll create loyal fans who are more likely to attend meetups and support your products.

[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you this is a special episode because it's with my dear friend Peter schallard and right before this episode I was thinking about our relationship and we've had some magical moments just some magical moments some crazy stuff has happened um we've been to Lithuania together we saw Carl Lagerfeld basically on the floor uh next to us do you remember that no what do you remember so in Lithuania he you know we were speaking at a conference Seth Godin was speaking at a conference and Carl lagerfed was like sandwiched in there and he went up on stage and he basically well number one he tried to convert everyone to Catholicism and then the second thing he did was he was he was like I'm gonna wait and he just basically like laid down on the stage while like 10 000 people were watching him the largest stadium in Central Europe it was the yeah it was the largest business conference in Europe like period it was a it was a massive Sports Arena um I but but wait I think you're thinking of Jean-Claude Van Damme oh that is who I'm that is who I'm talking about you're right yeah how could I forget yeah it's funny yeah the fact that that uh it was John Claude Van Damme wasn't even the strangest part of it all but yeah he lay he told the crowd that the world was going to end and he and he laid down on the stage and did breathing exercises for a while um totally get that you might misremember because it feels like a dream yeah so I wanted to bring you on the show because you're you're the shrink for entrepreneurs and I feel like I've got a few stories with you but I feel like you've got just hundreds thousands of stories because you're working with a lot of some of the most well-known people um but before we get into that how do you define what a shrink for entrepreneur is yeah well thanks for having me I'm excited to be chatting um shrink for entrepreneurs is you know my my background I'm a psychotherapist by training my I and I am an entrepreneur sort of my first but is well I am an entrepreneur when I started I wasn't my first business was a brick and mortar therapy practice um and so what what I did was was kind of long very long story short build a specialty I'm working with Founders a lot of uh a lot of Founders in Tech a lot of venture-backed Founders helping them with with psychology with therapy and then uh as you and I have discussed you know what I kind of ended up doing was taking the world's greatest life long MBA program because by working with these people I got to learn as much from them as I was helping them with their psychology so I've been at this for best part of 14 years now and it's been the world's greatest MBA that I was paid to take and so now I get to talk to my clients not only about psychology but business strategy as well and and literally every single entrepreneur I work with has the same story about what happened right before they met me which is oh I went looking for a therapist I knew I wanted to do you know some therapy some coaching I knew I wanted to optimize my thinking and behavior and um and then they just have this weird experience of talking to someone who just completely doesn't get it right like there's this sort of it's almost like a civilian attitude of just not knowing how entrepreneurship works that you know unfortunately most people who specialize in therapy they just they couldn't be further away from the the coal face of Entrepreneurship and they just don't get it there's this gulf of misunderstanding um and so yeah it's uh kind of world's greatest Niche that I that I stumbled upon um and and okay so walk me through how you actually help people like me yeah so um well first of all I generally meet people like you the morning after the darkest night of the Soul so I tend to think about like any type of therapy is you tend to reach out and get started when things are very very bad um so I meet a lot of people in crisis there's a lot of uh you know over the last decade there's been a few VC funds that will have me on speed dial for when a Founder that they believe in and they want to lead a company kind of has one of those crisis situations where if it goes badly they might end up not they might end up not being the right person to lead the company so I'm usually a resource that's put in to help the founder accelerate their personal growth and development when the company is such a rocket ship that it's like you know doubling every couple of months in size it's a it's the founder is waking up every day to a totally new business because of the scale and the speed at which it's scaling and um yeah and there's and and their job as CEO is changing so rapidly that like you know it's totally reasonable for anyone to kind of get some Whiplash from that so what I help them what I help Founders do is accelerate the rate of their development as operators As Leaders they're interpersonal skills their ability to do really great investor relations and I do that by helping them really iron out their cognitive biases and blind spots so you know any areas where a limitation in their thinking is causing them to not see the truth of what's going on and this is where this conversation can get really fractal right because we could talk about thousands of different examples um but a good one for a Founder who's really winning is like being a being a foil for their hubris right it's really easy for people who have quick wins to get carried away um and start to believe that everything they touch turns to gold and lose lose their kind of psychological calibration to what the actual result is what what's going on in their business and they might be winning when they start feeling that way but they may not notice it when they stop winning right when the when when when problems start occurring and so part of what I do is increase provide this like radical hit of self-awareness for entrepreneurs by being somebody that they're talking to who's like objective who's outside of the Fishbowl who's helping them see reality for what it really is so pretty pretty abstract but hopefully that makes sense could you yeah I I wanna I wanna take a few minutes to selfishly get you to coach me right now let's do it therapy for Greg let's go how are you doing Greg how am I doing right now amazing I'm in Charleston South Carolina and I you know running I run a holding company so I run a bunch of different startups so that's like a you know a roller coaster on steroids there's several roller coasters at once right several rollers are one so sometimes it's helpful for me just to like take a step back and just extract myself from the situation and like go somewhere like Charleston and sort of uh rebalance myself so that's what I'm doing right now rebalancing and it's been awesome I feel awesome to answer your question I feel great nice and uh what is it that you think you need to focus on when it comes to your thinking and behavior to really crush the next 12 months what what type of Greg do you need to be for this holding company you've built I would say the most important decision that me and many Founders can make is ignoring the noise it's so easy to chase shiny objects especially if you're running a studio and a holding company because the world is your oyster so what I'm trying to get better at is you know we for example yesterday there was the Apple event the brightest of shiny objects and there was a listen there was a lot of really cool stuff that's gonna like transform our businesses but at the same time like do I need to be like stopping what I'm doing and watching it and spending the whole day just kind of you know digesting what's happening like probably not like you know I probably can take a Saturday morning catch up on it in a more Leisure Way and that's probably more healthy for my well-being well-being than sort of being really really oh my God I need to go stop everything and rethink everything while it's happening right on yeah so what you're talking about is a real important key to mental health um it's it's a it's a principle of agency and volition that um one of the big things that can change out like relationship to stress overwhelm our ability to focus isn't even really about what we do right like you might watch that keynote start to finish but it's about being in control of the choice so that you're the one with the agency that it's not Tim Cook deciding that 10 a.m Pacific on a Tuesday or a Monday or whatever is uh is when Greg stops work and focuses on this it's about you to having like you having the agency you being the one who's in the driver's seat because even if you're tactically getting distracted by the bright shiny object at least you're choosing to you've got a thesis about why not's right to do that right so you don't need too much therapy you're doing it right Greg you're very smart staying in chat staying in charge and deciding these things is important because you know the Apple event's like a big one and it only happens once or twice a year but I think you know these social media platforms can be really dangerous for entrepreneurs because they'll look at you know they'll look at a tweet that they're just scrolling on the phone while they're sitting on the John before they start working on on a given day and they'll see something really interesting that's one of those bright shiny objects and it can feel like oh this is game changing information for my industry and whatever they intended to do that morning's out the window now because they're going down this Rabbit Hole of like learning but the rubber is like and this is what I kind of want to find out from you is how what is the rubric for deciding like I think you're someone who would have a really in interesting answer to this because with a holding company ostensibly you are looking out for really interesting New Opportunities right how do you what type of criteria do you have mentally at that earlier stage when you find yourself getting sucked in and getting curious and seeing the possibilities like are they like green lights and red lights for you mentally about like do I lean in do I go further do I do I look into this thing because uh if you do that all day then the stuff that you're the mature companies that you're that you've got opportunity to scale are you know going to Wither on the vine right you can't do it all so how do you decide a few things one is or if you're listening to this and pulling up a coffee cup it's an empty coffee cup and why is it an empty coffee cup well number one I love coffee but number two I only go on Twitter while I'm drinking coffee I call it the coffee framework so I drink a coffee in the morning and a coffee in the afternoon and while I'm drinking those coffees like I'm allowed to go on Twitter that's when I do my tweets that's why if you look at you know most of my tweets they happen between the hours of 9 and 10 30 a.m Eastern because that's when I'm generally having my first coffee and I allow myself to basically be like take it all in just go wild go like it's an all you eat all you can eat buffet for Twitter in the morning and in the afternoon when I'm you know if I'm on the John so just you know I like I I'm gonna want to pull out my my Twitter and I just try to refrain from doing that and it's just about setting these systems for yourself so that um you know I always say don't let push notifications push you around um and that's the second thing which is I don't know why 99.9 of people do not have Do Not Disturb mode on at all times like Do Not Disturb mode should be the default should not be you're getting buzzed every single time something happens in the world all notifications off by default off by default like what are you doing you know and I try to do this so I can actually have like the time and space to like think about okay like what do I want right now what is good for my businesses and it takes me from being on the defense to being on the offense really quick and this is something that I've been doing for like six six and eight months and it's it's really really like it's literally transformed my business that's incredible what so when you do have something that I'm just turning this into an interview less of a therapy session when you do have when you do have something that you really like when you have an idea when you have the very beginnings of something you think you want to pursue as an entrepreneur how do you know internally like I'm curious about your psychology how do you know internally this is something good that I should look like that I should explore versus like you know those very natural mental dialogues we have where we're like that's a distraction I've got to stay away from it so I don't know man I built like an intuition and you just gotta trust your gut like there's a reason why we have our guts you know and there's a reason why we feel certain things I'm laughing to myself because I was chatting with my co-founder her Theo yesterday and I was like and I quote we should do X I'm 100 sure it's gonna work and then he's sitting there like 100 percent like what are you are you on crack like the 100 how are you sure that if we're gonna go build that product or do that thing that it's 100 chance and sometimes you just gain so much conviction based on your gut that you just need to you need to follow your gut and yeah I would I wish like like in my 20s I followed my gut sometimes but I I really followed other people's guts I would be like okay if um Kevin Rose from dig is building a video startup I need to build a video startup or you know Kevin Systrom from Instagram is starting you know a news app I should build a news app and now I'm kind of trying to like ignore as much as possible and with the hopes that the stuff that I create becomes way more uh you know as Seth Godin puts it remarkable something that you'd make a remark of I mean this is one of the most kind of common cognitive biases that can trip up entrepreneurs who have like got something and they're running with it right is that that imitative desire that's driven by starting to like form a peer group what a lot of people who are starting out don't know is that it actually gets worse the more successful you become because you start to feel that you're sort of at the table with some of these amazing people and so a lot of entrepreneurs the more traction they get the more success they they create they start to pay more and more attention to what their peers and also the people who are just a little ahead of them who might have pretty big profiles like what those people are doing and what they're reacting to and what their insights and their mental calculus is about like the next big thing hence Kevin Rose is doing a video app you've got to do a video app right like a lot of that that effect actually becomes harder to resist the more kind of experience that you get until you get a level of maturity I think an intellectual maturity out the other side of it where you learn to put those things aside and that's one of the big things that I'll try to help entrepreneurs really focus on is this idea that people like Kevin Rose to use your example you know other like a level players doing really interesting stuff they're reacting like their insights their strategy that they might be like building in public right and tweeting about or whatever that stuff comes from their reaction to like primary sources of information so they see things happening in the world and then they go and build something because of it and then they talk about what they're doing so a lot of entrepreneurs pay attention to what these people are saying about what they're doing and they get that imitative desire and one of the ways that you can fix this cognitive bias is by focusing if you are going to consume information on the primary sources so that your intuition your instincts are reacting to the same information that these people like Kevin Rose are also reacting to because you're you're more likely to form a unique point of view if you're looking at what's happening in the objective world and thinking what can I do with that like what could I build with that rather than looking at hey what are these people doing right in how are they reacting to the real world to reality because there's a you know there's a Plato's Cave allegory there right if you're looking if you're just watching where they where the other people are moving to you're not seeing what it is that they're moving toward right like what their reaction is so um yeah there's a there's a terrific opportunity for entrepreneurs who you know who can figure this out to to trust their Instinct um and you know and and that's the path that you're going to take to develop a unique point of view that's going to be that's going to build a product that look at my 6 see it or fail like when you say you're 100 certain you should get after something the way I read that is you're 100 certain that it's going to be really really interesting right like it could be a really big win or it could be like a spectacular learning experience you're 100 certain of like a potent outcome exactly and that was actually Theo's response he started laughing and because he knows how ridiculous it is to say something like that and he was like okay so what you're really saying is how do we win even though we lose which I think was a really interesting way of framing it what do you what he means by that is okay crazy founder CEO of guy uh you know I understand that you're have got a lot of conviction um but this feels like a zero to one a zero or one thing like it's either gonna really be successful or it's gonna fall flat how do we make sure that we if it falls flat that we still learn because in the holding company model in the product Studio model learning is all also helpful because you can basically say like okay I learned this you know how to do Twitter ads or whatever and I can apply that to even though we spent fifty thousand dollars on Twitter ads and it went nowhere we can actually apply that to another one of our business right gotcha yeah yeah that's an inch we were jamming about just recently um when we hung out I think there's been a really big shift that you know with the holding company you're at the front of of like needing to the strategy of getting after getting after opportunities where there's obviously a win but then failure is like an actual of the win like a real concrete win because I think we're coming out of a period this is what you and I were chatting about of like big investing and technology companies a lot of hype kind of reached its absolute peak in 2021 where and you know in in that VC model it's it's like go big go go big or go bust that like you you want to be swinging for the fences a lot of people with shooting at crazy Big Ideas where there were 100 percent certain it was going to win or be an absolute massive failure right and uh when there's enough Capital floating around the system you can like rinse and rip you can you can you can take those shots but now there's an opportunity for entrepreneurs to to I guess like chase after ideas where there's an opportunity at really big success but even taking another fork in the road is like a different type of success right like trying to build a really big scalable company but if it doesn't go so well you accidentally build like a small cash flowing business that runs itself um these types of Dynamics I think we're going to see more and more of yeah I think so let's talk about VC versus non-vc a little more so and it relates to your whole idea the idea that like people are sort of following other people and copying other people what's that book uh the medic Renee Girard um yeah yeah I don't know everybody every every everyone in Silicon Valley knows the name of that book but I can't remember it right now yeah I mean the point of that book is basically that like people buy things that other people buy to self-identify and when you think about Venture Capital that is a business that is a like it's all about Trends and it's all about following what other people are doing so if crypto is hot people are going to invest in crypto if now VR is hard hot people are going to now invest in you know the new Apple Studio companies built on top of that Apple reality Pro or whatever they're calling it so like I don't know like two weeks ago the metaverse was dead now the metaverse is back is the metaverse gonna die you know what I mean so it's like you're just con VCS are just investing in companies based on these Trends and and what it ends up hap what ends up happening is you just see influx of companies that look and feel very similar that are attacking a space and one of those are going to win or a few of them are going to win and then they're gonna have outside's return the problem with that for for entrepreneurs is you end up following what you know you end up catering changing your business to be in one of those spaces so I just wanted to like that's just an observation I've had encourage your thoughts on that and then my other my question to you is like what percentage of your the people you work with are bootstrap versus VC and how do those like are those similar entrepreneurs do they have similar challenges can you talk more about that yeah I I'd say about maybe third a third maybe 40 of the clients I work with in general uh a bootstrap is um I love them I think that um like there's some bootstrappers out there that'll that'll turn you green with him right like the the types of businesses they've built the lifestyles that they enable um it's a you know it's incredible and it's a lot you front load the effort it's a lot harder when you start a bootstrap company and you're not getting no one's offering you Awards you're not getting written up in crime no one knows you exist right that those early years are like all grind whereas and I think this is what is so compelling and what was so compelling about the last decade of like crazy Venture Capital like froth and growth is that yeah like you stop feeling like a winner as soon as you get a meeting at like a major fund right there's all these from a psychological point of view there's all of these proxies for Success that are immediately accessible or short-term accessible along the path which is like a really long path to building a successful business that actually makes money right that like creates value in the world that convinces strangers to pay money at a at a good margin for that value being created that Journey could be like five ten years long but when you go down the VC route you can immediately start celebrating because you're getting written up on Forbes 30 under 30 right like you're at this you're at the pre-seed stage and you're booking meetings with really big investors you're telling your friends you're you're getting patted on the back for that let alone like getting to your actual first round of fundraising where a lot of like a lot of naive entrepreneurs feel like they've won they they pop a bottle right on the night that they that the funds wire for their seed stage not understanding that they're now obligated to a bunch of investors to work their ass off to build something that has a spectacularly High odds of not working out right like they now have a contractual obligation to grind really really hard um and a partner who's done their part because their part was writing the check and providing the capital and now it's all on you and so psychologically you know we I I talk a lot about this Dynamic that I call the action result gap which explains like a lot of uh human behavior right when there's a gap between taking an action and getting a result it becomes difficult for us for human beings to do those things right like there's an obesity epidemic the reason that so many people struggle to be in really great shape is that to get in really great shape you have to take the action of like working out eating salads and the result doesn't really kick in for like three weeks right if you like work out every day and eat salads every day three weeks later you'll maybe two weeks you'll step on a scale and be like huh and you'll get a result and there'll be that like dopamine serotonin experience of like wow like this is working I'm getting sexier this is cool but those two weeks are really hard for us psychologically right because of the gap between taking the action and the result whereas a donut has no action result Gap you see it you eat it you take a bite you immediately have that chemical experience right your your brain is bathed in these exciting neurotransmitters you've got fat you've got sugar you're enjoying yourself no action result Gap so it's a very compelling thing to do this is all an allegory for Venture Capital right when you can get high off of booking filling your calendar with meetings for your pre-seed company when you close that precede round right you haven't built a successful company you are not at the ultimate result but you've lined up all these literal results these little proxies for the things that you ultimately want that's that feel really emotionally compelling and that's why people get sucked in at a psychological level it's highly motivating because trying to build a successful business to a billion dollar exit over 10 7 to 10 years is really hard and that's the biggest action result gap of all but closing your next round is like in front of you in the next 30 days right and so it it gives us these kind of guard rails neurologically to go focus on to chase those highs that we ultimately need to inspire action so bootstrap is a bootstrap is a monks man they they have like a lot of mental discipline because you have to really have a vision you have to believe you have to be able to see what is possible and pursue and like live through this action result Gap um I think the cool thing about it is that like on the other side you get maximum freedom I think most entrepreneurs have like share a value of Freedom they they want autonomy and and bootstrappers are the ones who figure out that you can have it if you sacrifice it to begin with right because you're you know you're severely constrained when you're starting out you're you're using your customers to fund your business you're making promise like a lot of amazing bootstrappers started with the model of delivering services so that they have immediate cash flow up front and then Building Products that like creates some scale uh you know with the margin that they make and so like you know that Rick that's a lot of work that's like you have it you basically have a job for working for your customers so that you can build a product and a business that can put you out of a job one day um so yeah long journey big action result Gap but a lot of cool stuff on the other side if you can handle it and it's tough because you're like I just quit my job at Google making three hundred thousand dollars to go start an agency doing services and now I have like 20 clients that are you know emailing me all the time and texting me all the time and this doesn't feel like Freedom you know and I get that right like and you're making less so you have to be you have to really really believe in in what you're doing and and be true to the path and and also like I see a lot of bootstrappers that like will leave a company like Google start bootstrapping and then like three months later I see like they change their LinkedIn to like now they work at Shopify it's like no you have to this isn't something that you can just try for 90 days or 60 days and expect a result this is something that you have to have a serious time scale like I don't I don't know if it's five years but you know at least 12 to 24 months of like hey I'm gonna go and build this thing it's going to be bootstrap and I need to hit this goal of 20K mrr or whatever it is in order for me to continue quick Interruption from me if you're listening to this on Apple podcast or Spotify or getting any value you need to come to YouTube and subscribe to the where it happens podcast YouTube channel I promise you the experience is richer more interesting so if you're getting any value just stop what you're doing open up the YouTube app go to the website and press subscribe at where it happens on YouTube and if you're watching this on YouTube and you haven't subscribed what are you doing go go press subscribe thank you enjoy the rest of the show yeah totally and I think that you know I think every I think every entrepreneur to some degree is like motivated by freedom and a lot of uh a lot of people make the mistake of thinking that the high autonomy environment of just like going and raising money getting Venture funding behind you actually creates that freedom right that like so this when you've got some operating capital in the bank what most early stage Founders discover is they have this huge amount of autonomy there's not like a ton of supervision or scrutiny right like your investors if you have them they're not like micromanaging your time but that's really dangerous too because you're in this totally isolated state with a ton of money that other people's money that you've got to figure out how to build something with there's a purity to bootstrapping where you don't have that fake kind of Freedom right because you realize you're like oh man I've just traded my job with one boss at like Google aware of for a job with 24 bosses that I'm deeply accounted to accountable to and they want things and they want it to be fast and quality and cheap all at the same time and they're like blowing me up about it and I don't get paid to set meanings anymore um so it it does feel a lot like that isn't freedom but it is the you know I think fundamental principle that everyone needs to understand is that nothing of substance or lasting value is created without somebody like experiencing the discomfort of like putting the work in and making it happen so yeah it takes a little while to get to that to get to that place you mentioned before around you know people filling up their calendars with VC meetings and you know raising these pre-seed rounds and and people thinking like great like now I've made it I had a call yesterday with a Founder who's raised 600 million dollars multi-billion dollar uh valuation company and he's trying to figure out what to do like he here's a like you expect once you have hit unicorn status and you've got hundreds of millions in the bank like you're good and it's like no like you he if anything he's like even more stressed trying to figure it out I have a you have a client with a with a a company with north of a two billion it's a two point something billion dollar evaluation who um yeah has there's like problems that exist there they have a liquidity problem I have to be careful about how I you know frame this to give you like the light touches while protecting their privacy but you know the business is is big and successful but it's not quite hitting the metrics it needs to to have a successful IPO and it's too big to buy right there's no player in that space and that vertical that can come along and like acquire it and give the founders a Payday so guys worth hundreds of Millions on paper and um you know like struggles to come up with a down payment for a house in a major city and like in in the big cities in North America it's it's wild he's worth hundreds of Millions on paper but like you said on paper like to me like there's a bunch of Founders that right now that are worth a lot on paper that are going to have crazy headwinds like within the next six to nine months because they're gonna have to recap their companies and that the founders are they're gonna realize wow this Venture thing this is not as attractive as I originally thought because if you the other thing is for most Founders who take Venture Capital especially at like the series BCD and E stage these boards could fire you at any time so imagine starting a company raising 600 million dollars doing this for 12 14 years and you know recession hits not even like you know you did your best this is an outside externality that's happened recession hits and they're like okay thanks Peter it was great knowing you here's like a 12 month severance package you you know you'll have your stock but like we're gonna go and recap this company which basically is another another way of saying like we're going to change the ownership structure of this company um you know and uh like see you later like that's a reality it's a tale as old as time yeah happens all the time versus you're bootstrapping and it's like you are the captain of your ship yeah I think uh I think I think a lot of I mean to sum it up to put a bow on what we've been talking about I think a lot of people start out the Journey of of Entrepreneurship motivated by Freedom right that's what they ultimately crave is that autonomy that sense of being the captain of their fate the master of this all and then they start thinking about what's the best way to go about this and you have to be really really careful if that's you what types of strategies you start imitating because if you start chasing after like proxies artificial versions of that freedom like the freedom you think you have when you raise and see capital or like you know whatever then you can really quickly end up in a place where freedom is the last thing that you feel where you where you wake up every day you know stressed obligated with this enormous pressure upon yourself to you know to go and perform um because yeah that's that is what success looks like for a huge number of and we're talking now about champagne problems right like about the top one percent most successful people in that ecosystem that is what success looks like and so yeah I think I think I love that you're kind of banging this drum out there in the world because I think bootstrapping will always be hard because it's like a front loading of the effort right like you're taking the hits you're taking the knock to your freedom at the start where you've got to just you've got to find a way to sell the services do the work manage the clients do unscalable like unsexy things to pay the bills so that you can like like I think it's totally feasible to spend twenty percent of your time in your first year of Entrepreneurship as a bootstrapper building the product that's going to one day liberate all the rest of your time right like it can really be you might spend eighty percent of your time just doing fee for service type work if you're just starting out that you know my journey was exactly that right like I built a therapy practice trading my time for money and for a long time it was just a journey of increasing my prices like if I want if my lifestyle want if I wanted to have any upward Mobility I was like guess I gotta charge more and you know after several years of doing that and succeeding to the point that my rust was booked and I had this great network of entrepreneurs referring me business and you know that I I looked around and was like I don't know if I can keep doing this for the rest of my life I've got to find something that scales um what can I do and that was when I started just like tinkering and iterating and playing with ideas and it was really hard because I would do it online like Friday afternoon right like a time that not many people want to go to therapy and when I when I had some free time in my schedule that was when I would build and play an experiment but I mean for me it was like you know I was living in New York City I was it's not a cheap place to live it was like 90 90 95 of my time was FIFA service so that I could build something that could make money you know without me being the central engine in the machine I want you to talk about what you built with commit action but I also want to let you know that when you told me about commit action probably like I don't know 12 years ago or something when when did it start yeah I mean that would have been when I was like having the idea that it became you know like the yeah the very beginning yeah when you told me the idea I was like in my mind I was like you are crazy like why would you do this thing you know you're at the center of all these you know big Venture back startups you know you you know people like goadin and all these well-known people like why would you go and create a a service like this that could max out at 20 million 40 million a year in Revenue that's like what my in my mind I thought about and probably in my mind even less than that in my mind I was like this is a five million dollar business fast forward to today I'm like man like you did all the right things you literally did all the right things you took a service business where you were making money you learned about the problems you productized it you learned how to scale via profitable marketing channels you never raised a dollar you have a good name and it's been compounding ever since so tell tell people what it is because I think a lot of people can learn from your how you did it and uh and let's go I will I do have to just clarify though I did raise some money and I want to shout out uh human Ventures they uh a VC who actually understands the hold Co model one of the most successful companies in their portfolio they're building in this way they have a huge stake in ckbg which is the parent company the holding company that produces a bunch of spirits companies and so I came to them with the idea um like they're building this really cool business there in a similar model to the way you are at lake checkout and um I came to them with the same idea I was like I want to raise the first and last round for this company a little bit of jet fuel and um you know to their credit they were like up for it they saw the vision and so we did it but yeah I just I just wanna for all the for all the [ __ ] we're talking about VC I want to uh shout out to the people who get it well the the the side note to that is someone needs to create a venture fund that is called last round Ventures first and last round Ventures where you take money it's like a bootstrap business but it's like a little bit of money to actually like get you to profitability and that's it like you don't there's no expectations that you're gonna raise more you know I remember when we closed their uh one of the GPS on this sort of CFO of that whole coat was like look dude this is a great idea and if it pays dividends one day that'll be a win um and like that's a that's a cool partner to have yeah so yeah um shout out to those guys um what was the question how do we with commit action and why is it cool yeah commit action is a so commit action is the company that I built uh that was out of my services business and it's uh it's a productivity company what we do is a coached weekly planning ritual for entrepreneurs for creatives for executives we solve a problem if you're one of these people you're working in the knowledge economy your your ability to succeed is dependent entirely on how how well you execute on the big bold ideas that you have and so we're a a company dedicated to improving the focus the execution the ultimate personal effectiveness of entrepreneurs um and people like that by helping them combat what we believe is the primary cause of people's lack of focus right the big problem in 2023 is not people not being passionate enough not wanting it enough lacking access to like how two guides or whatever we like our cup run over with that it's out it's the isolation that entrepreneurs and creatives and execs often have to build and execute within that causes problems with their focus their productivity that causes them to self-sabotage and procrastinate so what commit action is is a real simple coached weekly planning ritual where you actually work with somebody one of our highly trained ninja productivity coaches to sit down and plan out the highest leverage use of your time every single week then you've got someone on your team right commit action enables you to hire this Pro effectively to be your dedicated focus and focus and accountability guy or girl who's single singular job is to keep you focused and in the zone at all times so we're the only productivity company in the world that rather than focusing people on checking off a bunch of to-do's or project management we just care about what is the highest leveraged use of your your time and are you carving out even just a couple of hours a week to work on that thing that picking up the ball and moving it forward for like whatever's next for you whatever creates the growth um so it's a coaching company it's a weekly planning ritual is ultimately the the you know what you get and the way it works is as a subscription you sign up on a monthly membership and you get a weekly planning call with a coach every single week and they stay in touch with you they build a plan um for you they set up a bunch of appointments for you to do deep work appointments you set with yourself to show up and work on your biggest opportunities and they hold you accountable to that calendar on that set of appointments by staying in touch and texting you and what not throughout the week so yeah it's like having it's like having a personal trainer but for your productivity rather than just working out and from a size perspective could you share a little bit about like scale like how many customers or like how big is the business yeah we've worked with we've worked with thousands of of customers we've we've scaled it up to you know close to about that five million dollar Mark at this point so it's kind of funny because yeah you were right like when you thought about that idea I mean I'd kill to get it to 40 million and I think we will um but that's kind of where we're at in terms of annual revenue and what's amazing about that is that we make a profit every single month where you know we're growing and um there's like a crazy economic model attached to the business because we create a ton of value in the world so the secret to our if you want to like pop the hood the secret to our business model is that the service really works right like if you want to check out we we get third-party verified reviews on trustpilot people describe the experience of having a personal trainer for productivity is like life changing the copy is so exuberant in the testimonials people just write themselves that we we can't use them in marketing sometimes because they're so over the top it's almost cringe-worthy it's like kind of frustrating I I'd kill for like a four star like this was pretty great to just like make us look human um make us look normal so it it really really works and the secret is customer retention right that we have these clients who start the service and recognize that it's like a it's like a mental gym membership it's you know when you when you're dedicated to Fitness and you find a trainer who gets you and gets you results like why do why would you ever stop then when you're an entrepreneur you find this this way to be productive and focused that creates Roi in your business you know in most cases is like 10 to 50x uh the the sort of annual return on investment for what they might be paying us you just keep doing it and so we've we've launched the companies like an alpha pilot and it was just pure Services right talking about bootstrapping we had no software platform we had nothing it was just it was just pairing people up with coaches on my team to do this account this weekly planning ritual we have clients from the initial Alpha pilot who are still worth with us today we've had people who have been with us the best part of a decade um and just voting with their wallets every single month being like this is something meaningful this is something that works and so yeah that's what's been like a big key big Key to Our Success is just refining you know I've spent years refining the service refining the methodology to make it really effective we uh you know we built a science Advisory board with the professor of neuroscience at Harvard Medical School with the professor of positive psych at NYU to just get to the bottom of like what is the evidence what is the real science what's the evidence-based way to help entrepreneurs be more effective and so we just you know that's the thing about bootstrapping you kind of have to effort Max you have to grind absolutely every aspect of your business so we just had this idea and then systematically sat down at the beginning and said how do we improve the [ __ ] out of every single part of this every single little interaction and uh you know ultimately scaled to you know building engineer and engineering team team in-house and building our own software all to create the ultimate weekly planning ritual for entrepreneurs how much have you I mean you how much have you optimized marketing and marketing channels you know because we've talked a little bit about optimizing retention and the product itself but how much of or how much are you doing like r d essentially marketing r d in terms of new channels to to bring customers in a little bit my as a like as a kind of a bootstrap and my tendency is always to focus on the product first and foremost right like that's that's really what I've been getting after so I will say like I'm I'm better at building an accountability coaching methodology technology Etc than I am as a marketer like I've got a lot to learn when it comes to marketing but we did have some wins I mean we've built we've built marketing channels that have like a sub 30 day payback on customer acquisition cost which is like a super awesome key to you know to scale so we you know we figured that out a couple of years ago which enabled us to run ramp up we're always looking for new stuff right now I'm in the very early stages of experimenting with Organic content you know it's something that I tactically decided to ignore for many many years because I was building you know I wanted to build something bigger than me and I had built a sort of a personal brand not that I was famous on the internet but I was pretty well known within certain circles in the entrepreneurship world so for me commit action was a journey of like focusing on product at the expense of I've kind of let this organic audience building thing Pass Me By and now I'm putting some more focus on it now that the commit action is like up and running and you know pretty much runs itself at this point from a day-to-day basis that's I've uh I've started a little YouTube channel I'm posting some stuff on Instagram I think just like you um yeah just experimenting to see like you know we've learned a lot over the last few years about helping entrepreneurs be really effective and we have like a ton of um we have a ton of like information that's really useful I think like science about you know really counter-intuitive things about what it takes to be really focused and really effective as an entrepreneur and the cool thing about selling a real meaty service right is that we can give away all of the information for free right like where I and that's kind of the journey that I'm on right now is I'm trying to figure out the right formats and the right way to just kind of share our methodology and teach anyone who wants to pay attention how we do things that come in action how we turn entrepreneurs into these execution powerhouses um because yeah you can you know the the secret to it all is you know we have a lot of techniques we have a lot of amazing methods but that at the heart of them is human accountability um and that's from a science point of view one of the biggest levers human beings have to improve their their behavior their output to become more focused to become more effective is uh yeah is figuring out how to use social psychological engagement like connection with other humans to keep them focused where where social primates we're hardwired to perform at our best when we're connected to others and that's what our business is built on yeah the reason why you're gonna win as a organic content creator is a few fold number one you're known as the shrink for entrepreneurs that itself is super memorable like when you have a memorable name like that that is it just you're you're playing on easier mode than hard mode the second is your point of view on this stuff uh like productivity and unlocking growth it's it's a unique perspective see it's not like you're remixing other people's stuff you're basically you know the whole the whole concept around it being like rooted in science I think is just a really fresh take so I think once you're putting out content like having a fresh take I think of performs and really really really gets people excited about you um and so I'm like yeah I'm excited I think you're gonna you're gonna crush it based on those two things which platforms are you most excited about uh you mentioned Instagram YouTube like what do you think is going to work the best I don't know what's gonna work the best for me right like that's where I'm kind of like I'm the most curious right now is like where does my where do my sensibilities and like you know what the algorithms are rewarding right now kind of overlap like when's the where's the Venn diagram there I'm extremely I would say I'm just in general extremely bullish about YouTube as a platform in general like I think it's I think it is insane how the Legacy Media just sleeps on YouTube in terms of the the size of the audience there uh there's also been I gotta like take my hat off to Google for this there's been an absolute transformation of YouTube as a social media platform most people don't really think of it as a social platform but if you get into like self-development self-improve Movement YouTube there is a bunch of like people anonymously commenting and interacting in there in the most wholesome way possible it's like it's such a good vibe um so it's like I you know I I think we are watching a generational shift from television um to these platforms and I I think YouTube is I think it's already huge it's way bigger than most people realize um and I think it's just I think it's just getting started it's going to be bigger and bigger so I'm really excited about that place about that space as I think part of the magic of it is that it rewards effort right like the people who are succeeding on that platform uh you know they're they're grinding they're they're you know they're they're kind of coming around to the level of production that like people put into television shows and um and so I think we're gonna I'm I'm always interested in competing in a space where you can win with quality because I just I like that like I want to make if I'm gonna make something I want it to be like top shelf and so um yeah I I'm excited about that platform for that reason I think I think uh I also just wouldn't take a bet against meta right like I think you know the stock prices got hammered in the last few years they've people talk a lot of [ __ ] but there's some amazingly talented people there and um you know Instagram is the de facto first place most people go to scroll and like waste their time um and consume content and there's an interesting opportunity there too for sure yeah my take is when you're starting out you want to build an audience you really do need to pick one platform and and really just try to optimize it as well as you can and it might be attractive to be like oh I I already have these shorts I might as well put them on Instagram or I might as well put them on Tick Tock but it's like but now you're thinking about those other platforms when you should really be thinking about how do I make how do I become known on YouTube for the next six months I'm only going to focus on being known on YouTube group and I know I'm gonna miss out on Instagram and Tech talk and stuff like that but uh yeah that's my my take uh right right now on on building building uh audiences good advice focus focus focus cool yeah I probably needed to have that well I feel like dude you can do it uh commit action version of it just for like audience Builders so it's like sign up to you know commit audience.com and every single day we're gonna give you like we're your audience productivity expert and we're gonna give you uh advice on on how how your content really is like for example for me I hate listening to myself or watching myself on YouTube I like can't it's like super cringe-worthy but if I had like an expert just give me notes and tell me what I did wrong this week in terms of social media like yeah I'd pay pay for that monthly oh interesting there you go Greg throwing out bootstrap business ideas yeah cool take it dude take it sleep on it yeah I'll have a think about it I mean I definitely think that that owl like coaches at commit action often find themselves in that role of like you know they're there for the to give structure and accountability and create that that that best practice of planning the week but they often become these like allies and I mean they get fully embedded on the client's team and will be reacting to the stuff they're putting out there in the world we have a we have so many clients that they that you know a big part of why they use the service is to execute on these like long tail creative goals where you have to ship stuff every single day and like you know watch that audience like you know cumulatively compoundingly build in the long term so yeah I think you're right before we head out what's uh what's the biggest tip you can give to folks around productivity biggest tip around productivity is you're crazy to do it alone right like like I said we're social primates we're hardwired to perform at our best hundreds of millions of years of evolution have optimized human beings to be at their best when they're working together in groups and one of the really dangerous things for you know entrepreneurs for creatives for creators out there in today's world is that we are really socially isolated right these parasocial relationships behind through the screen they don't do to our monkey mind to our animal brain what actual social connection does so the first basic tip for improving productivity and focus is to have people in your life who care who you talk to about your goals and you talk to about your implementation intentions if you've got friends that you're discussing you know mutually with where and when am I going to work on my biggest ideas and then they're checking back in with you you're simulating what we do like at a professional level at commit action and it works that you know the science on it is like Case Closed overwhelming evidence just even the anticipation of social accountability that it might happen is shown to him improve people's follow-through on goals by up to a hundred percent right like there's some wild studies out there about how this stuff is effective so I think the tendency for a lot of people starting out or working on anything big is like taking into the bat cave keep it secret keep it safe right like just like work on it work on it until the world is ready but you've you've got to get some allies you gotta uh you gotta you gotta add some accountability because that's what sharpens the focus that's how human beings Were Meant to do their best work and a bonus tip of course is to go hang out with Jean-Claude Van Damme in Lithuania and don't listen to anything he says oh dude I'll never forget pounding champagne with jcbd at that scary ass nightclub haha deep deep in the heart of ildius Lithuania that was uh yeah that was to this day one of the craziest nights of my entire life shared with uh Mr Greg Eisenberg we do it we do it we do it for these Pinch Me moments you know I think uh that's the fun part about entrepreneurship is it it it it it puts you in places you wouldn't think are possible stop bootstrapping something one day you wake up and Vilnius Lithuania drinking champagne with jcvd totally we'd love to see it all right man well where could people find you on the internet well you can check out my brand new YouTube channel um this is just under Peter shella and you can also find what I've built at commit action.com if you want to come take a look at uh at what we're up to there

Title: Why You Need To Treat Each Social Platform Individually, Explains Austin Lieberman
Published: 2023-06-09 14:00:06 UTC
Description:
YouTube is by far the best platform for growing an audience.

Unlike other social media platforms, you don’t have to have a large following to see impact straight away on YouTube.

Other platforms like Twitter, LinkedIn and Instagram, have been known to deprioritize your content if you’re sharing external links.

This makes it counterproductive to try and link your content creation together.

Instead, it might be time to start thinking about your platforms as separate community hubs.

the other thing I love about YouTube for anybody who's thinking about starting a channel is you don't have to have a following anywhere else to get really large on YouTube and I think the next three to five years is gonna be more about especially as we see like Twitter de-prioritizing outside links and then trying to prioritize organically uploaded pictures and videos the next three to five years is actually going to be about growing disconnected audiences on different platforms and what I'm trying to do is share less and less of my YouTube links to Twitter and just grow YouTube independently from growing Twitter

the numbers for me don't equate to us loving a video on my team if we have a video that has a million views and it really really popped off I'm not looking at that and being like we need to do every video like this I want it to affect the core people that I want to be in my community not necessarily just reach millions and millions of people so what I look for more is like how did we feel with this video when we put it up and do the people that are replying to us that we're hearing from that we're getting feedback from are they the people that we care about getting that feedback from and if I get feedback from my actual core demo then I'm like oh this was impossible

[Music] [Music] thank you I want to start where we started which was over 10 years ago Los Angeles we had a Founder's Mastermind that's where we met describe to people what that what that was and maybe why you think it's important that people do it that was one of the most uh amazing experiences in my life and I've had the opportunity over my life to facilitate and Lead many quote unquote masterminds if you will intentional communities coming together to make one another better and when we did this man we had such an amazing group of individuals of course it was young Greg Eisenberg I don't think you had your driver's license yet we had people like Julian Smith of breather Fame and his new amazing amazing coaching product we had Rob Sandy we had Dario Melly we had Malone I'm not going to try to pronounce his last name right now uh just an amazing group of people that came together to get each other better I think what's unique about it Greg is that in this age people are super super competitive and and they hold things super close to to the chest and they don't want to share what they're working on but Our intention was to come be vulnerable share what we're working on and then get input from like seasoned accomplished successful men to make it better and that's exactly what happened and out of that very first weekend when we did that and we've had more of those some companies have been made they've iterated he probably had two companies that were formed that weekend that have been sold Julian Dario as well and it's just a reminder that how important humility is and how important it is that of course in this amazing digital world that we can see people on screens like you and I are seeing each other right now but magic happens when you're when you're in the same room and you're around folks that uh are going to make you better and push you I think that's a key word that happened that time we spent together over the years is that folks were challenged in a positive way I like to think about it as some people call people out that that group had called people up you know what I'm saying so what we did is we rented like a mansion in LA we got a private chef and we were there for 72 hours and you moderated the whole thing and the way it worked was every founder would go up I think there was a not a whiteboard but like a plant white uh blank big Post-its yeah Post-its exactly and everyone would wear their heart on their sleeve and say what's going well with their business what's not going well um and some people even just didn't even have a business but wanted to start something uh why do you think that format works so well well one it was intimate first and foremost uh two that format worked extremely well because in some shape or form trust had been established not everyone in that room had had met one another at the previously so they had trust because Greg knows this person or Dario knows this person Etc but also it was very clear what the intention was I think a lot of times the reason why masterminds and these type of group things they don't succeed or people don't get value out of them is because there aren't clear intentions there aren't clear metrics kpis why we are here and we we before we even sat down and started breaking down business ideas we asked some key questions we asked questions like what does success look like when we're checking out of this this mansion in a few days for you to say this investment from a dollars and since perspective from a Time perspective Etc what is it going to tell you that this was successful so we established that not only that we did some intentional grounding I'm not sure if you recall Greg we went around the room we talked about how do you like to receive feedback do you want a blunt do you want to direct or do you like to receive it a little bit differently because one thing we didn't want to create was an environment of posturing or creating people who are starting to get defensive you know some people like Top Line bullet points right some people need to pause before they hear anything some people like more of a story some people like to hear examples so we set created that container where people could come in with the clear intention of what the goal was they could be successful in that and I'll say the last thing and we I touched on this in the beginning was the trust component of it like there was a we didn't even need to say hey what happens in this room stays in this room we know these were good dudes who were vetted there's going to be confidential and it was trust and you could look at every man it happened to be all dudes you can look at every man in that room know that that dude that dude was a dog like he was a beast already it was like having an All-Star team like when all NBA All-Star team comes together you know those are some big personalities and egos but they're on the same mission to win the game Rob Sandy so this was a guy who our our mutual friend Shane Mack was like oh Rob should really come to this event type thing and we're like okay he sounds cool he had a company called it was called vid IO now it's called vid IQ it's one of the most popular tools for creators to use none of us knew him and he he did like he took a chance on us like he flew all the way down and he was this like loving bear-like you know she want to give him a hug type guy and do you remember like the shift in his business from that from that first weekend I don't remember the exact details of that shift but I do recall what you just said in terms of us not knowing him and him like taking a bet on us but also remember him showing up being very different than everyone else I think it's fair to say that he was very much a heart-centered kind of guy a heart-centered leader from an entrepreneurship perspective uh but what was wild I want you to share what was it what happened between his business before and after but even like a company like breather and I'm not sure how much we can share right here right now what breather ended up being this amazing space where you could get on your phone and go rent an amazing office space for an hour or for a day or a conference room that was not where Julian came in with his initial idea for this thing it was so far removed from that so the iterations that took place where were pretty extreme so with Rob he came in with his concept was called or he had built a prototype or early product called vid IO and everyone was like is it video is it vid.io and he's like I don't you know he didn't really know and we're like dude if you don't know how to say the name of your company you might need to change the name of your company yeah and he changed it to vid IQ and the same with Julian right Julian came in and he was like okay this is you know my concept for this thing called breather.com he had just bought the domain and and he was open to feedback and iterated from it and I think what's interesting about that weekend that we had and these types of masterminds is when you think of like founder events right now you have these like really big South by Southwest type things or Collision conference or all these really big events and then you you don't have enough sort of small intimate stuff you have big events and then you have you're with your team and you're working with your team so you know I just wrote a post actually I just published it and I said one of the biggest regrets in my 20s was not doing that event every single year those things are so transformative versus the big group type of of setting and they're revealing in many ways as well I think for leaders and entrepreneurs who are building things uh nine times out of ten you know they look to be the individuals or they're the individuals that everybody comes to and assumes they're going to have the answers very rarely can they find them in a space of peers where they're not leading where they can actually participate they can get feedback they can learn Etc and not be the drivers and for a dude like Rob and a dude like Julian and do like Dario maloon Etc to come in and be willing to Pivot to hear some maybe some some critical feedback things that may not be easy uh but because sometimes you don't know someone well you're willing to hear that right sometimes the people who are close to us of course we don't want to listen to them right it's like amazing you're dating someone and you've been giving your girlfriend advice for a long time and she won't take it but then she comes back like oh I was on the plane some guy gave me some advice and here's what I'm gonna do and you're like that's what I told you to do six months ago and sometimes the people that you gotta have that distance from individuals that you can build that trust with yeah I think uh it's it's building trust and it's and it's also just being open to the feedback um deep down I feel like a lot of us knew what we should do with our businesses but we needed someone to tell us uh I needed like Dario to be like hey this isn't you know this is a bad idea we've also had like quote unquote famous internet people come to this event right we had um Sean Pourri from my first million come to the event and he pivoted his product uh shortly thereafter so I think reminiscing about this is just making me long for doing this more often and I'm just wondering what advice could you give to people who want to start their own Mastermind like this yeah uh well one even before we talk about that I'm trying to flash back to the name of what your product was you're working on at that time it was uh not fly by it was uh the initial yeah it was called five by yeah five five I forgot about that that was that was beautiful man uh I still remember like really enjoying that being able to put in the subject matter push and play and it being great um but in terms of what you can do like the strong components to have a strong Mastermind uh one you probably want to drop the word Mastermind because I think in these day and ages people hear that word I think it scares people more than it actually excites them some recommendations first and foremost six to eight people Max probably six is the is the perfect number of individuals uh second you want to have a facilitator some type of coach or person that's guiding and leading the conversation taking notes on the Whiteboard Etc picking up on things that haven't been heard I know there are a lot of masterminds that don't have facilitators or leaders and I find that those typically don't work out well you need that person the referee if you will or the MC to move things along but also someone who's has experience working with groups like that have a strong format to the day uh pretty much standard format for us is what someone would get the opportunity to present about what they're working on for 30 or 45 minutes and then we'd have a build session after that where we dig into it we ask questions we provide feedback Etc we also had like quote unquote Learning and Development sessions as well that that person that you hired a facilitator lead that you should walk away knowing you learn something as well you added something to your to your toolkit that you walked away with make sure you don't have to think about things you don't want to think about when we woke up breakfast was ready lunch was taken care of by that private Chef sometimes we'd go out to a nice dinner in the evenings make sure outside of the build sessions and the learning that you're doing in this Mastermind over the course of a day or a few days make sure there's ample room for play I mean we we did surfing lessons we skateboarded we uh dare I say we shot guns we shot guns like Not Just Guns but like these massive guns and what's cool about the play the walk from the house to the restaurant or the walk from the house to the gym or after you finish surfing you're going back to the vehicle powerful moments happen then because then like it can be like kind of the one-on-one conversations and you're like hey something you said earlier you know it's really been sticking with me and so those moments are that down time is critical and something else that's that's key Greg and I'm sure you would agree with this is what I've come to learn in my life is that sometimes our biggest breakthroughs can happen when we're helping someone else for me that's where the magic is the masterminds of us helping someone else these weekends as much as you walked away with progress and everyone else did a lot of the progress we made came when we were helping someone else like we're we learned something about their business we're like oh wow now I can actually apply that to what I'm doing as well so have a clear structure and format I have a facilitator make sure you have some down time and some play that's involved make sure you don't have to think about the eating and that kind of stuff um move your body sweat and it can lead to an amazing experience the gun thing let's just talk about that for a second so especially like the look on on the faces of the Canadians who don't really like you know we had a lot of Canadians in the room and there's you know there's not many guns up up North so to speak so I felt like the Americans had a bit more you know uh they were more acclimatized to what a gun is and how it works and we went to I don't know I think it was like an Inglewood or somewhere where no it was in the valley somewhere it was in the valley we walk in I just couldn't believe it like we gave our driver's license and there's like okay like now go pick from these like 20 guns and not just any guns we're not talking about small pistols we're talking we're talking about big massive powerful guns and all I remember is you getting one of those guns and I don't think you probably knew at the time now listen you're Canadian you wouldn't have known right how powerful this doggone thing was I can still see you shooting it and it's just taking your arms just you just flew you up and I think I saw the shock in your face like what hey what are we doing here and and B that was that was pretty awesome I mean I didn't realize it and I remember you telling me this you're like dude like there's recoil so when you shoot a gun it's gonna hit back on you you have to like kind of protect yourself and it was in these moments of fear where we all got to know each other and that trust was built so I think layering on of you know I'm not suggesting people you know need a shoot a shotgun to to build trust but like yeah like things like this are going to build trust yeah it's the things that happened some like even like when I think about the traditional like you know University experience most of the learning that happens on a college campus it doesn't happen in the classroom it happens outside the classroom when you're living right that's why as much as people are major proponents of remote work and I have nothing against a remote work I am a strong proponent of in-person elements as well like if you lead a remote team it is so critical you get together in my opinion at least on a quarterly basis face to face for a couple of days or a day because those collisions that happen when you're uh with one another are just so powerful that they're just different remote is great video is great and there's something magical special that happens in those conversations that happen again on the walk to the restaurant when you're leaving shooting guns that you probably shouldn't have been shooting uh when you see someone like you see someone get off of the phone like in a break of a mastermind and you can tell they just have maybe a tough conversation with an employee or with a girlfriend or something like that that's where intimacy is created when people don't have access to like these types of people like what should they do so for example like someone's listening to this and they're like wow that sounds really cool that you had like the coolest bunch of people come together and you had a bunch of breakthroughs and a bunch of people raised hundreds of millions of dollars some people took their companies public I live in Idaho and you know I'm working on a startup or I'm a product manager at Procter and Gamble but I'm like inspired by startups how do you go from not having these people to having these people to showing up and then at an event like this that's the biggest feedback I get like must be nice it must be nice Tony to have this kind of community like you know my thing is this Mad Morning Community a newsletter here in Los Angeles and we meet every Thursday and it's just a ridiculously amazing group of guys in their chapters that are popping up popping up all across the country but the feedback even in my book stop being on autopilot is how do you find these people and well one thing I'll remind everyone is that this crew these people one they don't always have to be your best friends I think we have to think we have to be really close with these people like they don't they've been people you respect you have an admiration for but they don't need to be your best friends you kick it with and you talk to every single week the mission is that you have a mission to be better at X Y or Z so so just know that first and foremost uh second I always like to invite people to go where people grow go to find places where people are learning you know uh in your local community there could be a variety of places if you're in the middle of nowhere some of those options may be virtual as opposed to in person but where there are people who are going to grow and learn go there that may mean you need to invest in getting on a plane and attending a conference every single year and mix it up going across the country maybe even all across the globe where you can put some names and faces to the handles and the people you see on Twitter and then you see on LinkedIn and Beyond so find those conferences and those in events where people are mingling and get together and get uncomfortable and go to that guess what this is breaking news for a lot of people and this is the biggest resistance I see Jeff um Greg so I'd love to see your perspective on this is sometimes you have to write a check I think people feel so much resistance for paying some for something there are so many amazing online virtual communities that also have like in-person components but you have to write a monthly check it's a membership model or if you're writing annual check to participate in these and sometimes these things aren't necessarily cheap you know you can look at something like you know Sam Powers building right now with Hampton that's a nice check that those Founders have to to write but the odds are that that check they write every single year or month they're probably making that money back like tenfold if not more based on the learnings that they're getting so whatever hesitation people have to writing a check to being willing to invest in themselves I just invite you to press pause like I'm a coach I've been coaching you know leaders and Executives for over 10 years now and guess what I have a coach and I write a nice nice check to every single month I write a check to an online community that I'm part of of other folks that work in my field and do similar work so I can learn and stay up to date with what's what's happening so one sometimes you have to write a check these communities exist online they are there join a cohort based group learning something like Community College that like like you have Greg with his ongoing learning um so I just hear a lot of excuses for that but most times it may have to start online but then and don't forget to get on a plane and go see folks face to face as well yeah if it was a few years ago I would be like way more PG with my answer and be like no you know make some make a bunch of money and have it in a bank account once you have in the bank account then go and invest in it and now just like being honest like I was a teenager and like swiping my credit card and like getting on a plane to San Francisco to like meet people and that's kind of the price you need to pay for a seat at the table like I think that a lot of people expect to get into these rooms and they get frustrated when they can't but either you need to fly to where these rooms are and where these events are happening and where these you know courses or events you know intimate Gatherings are happening or the other idea is you you just you do with the Summit Series people did Summit started off uh Elliott biznow started off basically on a credit card I think he I think it was like in Utah or somewhere where he brought together a bunch of well-known entrepreneurs when he was like 21 22 23 put on his credit card and like just cold DM them and hosted this event in Utah and it became a really big event now with like you know they just had one off Miami and Richard Branson I saw was there and all these people right so what do you think about that idea if like you if you don't have that Network actually just going and creating a landing page creating a mission and start cold dming people yeah well I think the first one Ellie did was actually in DC I remember hearing about that many years ago and different folks that were there well and briefly to your point sometimes you got to get on a plane and like you said swipe that credit card before I became an author and speaker and doing the man morning Community I was a guy that worked in the television industry in New York City for over 12 years for major networks I was like I'm live tv as a correspondent with NBCS and Bets and Nickelodeons Etc and guess how that started you moved to New York City with less than a thousand bucks in my bank account the cliche story and three years later guess what three years later I found my way on live TV every single day but in between Landing with less than a thousand dollars in my bank account and getting on live TV one thing that I did being in New York City I did informational meetings every single week and what I've come to learn is that and you know this Greg nine times out of ten people are willing to help you people are willing to support you they're willing to give you their time uh if you ask for it and second if you happen to be there and if the people that you emulate the people you respect that happen to be in San Francisco they happen to be in New York they happen to be in New Orleans if even if you're not going to move there you got to find your way there and put some some some faces to these people you see on the internet and yeah that means writing a check that means buying a plane ticket it may mean staying in an Airbnb or sleeping on someone's couch but the most powerful thing you can say if you're trying to get someone's time in that Twitter DM and that LinkedIn DM or that Instagram DM hey I'm actually going to be in the Miami area in two weeks Greg for an event if you have time I'd love to meet you and buy you a cup of coffee now when you send that message you may have no no itinerary no reservation made but if Greg says okay great I'll have a cup of coffee you buy that ticket I've done that many times in my life with with success now do you need necessarily to start your your own event and put it on a credit card you absolutely can but my suggestion for step one is just fly to where the people are if they're in the bay go to the Bay they're in Seattle take a week trip to the Seattle save your save your coins and make that happen people want to help you but a you have to ask and B you got to be there dude I remember one of the first times I went to San Francisco swipe the credit card get there I had found on Facebook there was this boat in the shore of the bay and it was like I don't know 40 I don't know I think it was like honestly 25 bucks a night and I was like perfect I'm just gonna stay it's like 25 a night and it's other Founders who are staying on this boat wow was like kind of cool I show up it's like midnight landed with like my carry-on like we're not talking about a super yacht that that was the you know in my mind I'm like oh yeah I'm sure like the it's pretty nice no no it's like this is I was like this is a boat that was like from the 1940s that was used in in like World War II and the lit let's just say it was basically like sleeping on a floor of a of a boat and sometimes you just have to just do it and just be like okay like this is the price I need to pay if I want to get into this room yeah most people unfortunately in my experience you know I get DMS probably like you do all the time from from people who are just beginning their career or people probably like you Founders who are trying to start something and they ask questions how to do X how to do why how to do Z and I'm like one one if you ever want to get a job in New York City guess what you need to be in New York City uh it's hard to get one if no one's flying you out for an interview no one's flying you out for an interview in uh in San Francisco yeah I get it there's remote interviews those things that take place but there's proximity is such a powerful tool and the story you just told Greg about sleeping on on the floor of a boat right in San Francisco I stepped on the floor for over six months in Queens in New York before I ever got you know I was able to get get a bed those are the stories man that's where you build up certain grit you build up resilience you build up some confidence in yourself you start to have this track record and what you're doing also is like living an interesting life I love some told me once live an interesting life no one wants to talk to an old person who doesn't have interesting stories to tell right and that's something that you totally have so many of and I even think about you even after you were quote unquote successful I mean you even went back when you went back to college in Alabama and lived that life and to learn more about your product and how to make that product even more successful you know how a few Founders even if they were successful would be unwilling to go back and live on a college campus not not very many but obviously you built a little different yeah and I think uh well first of all I appreciate that but I also think like I hope people listening kind of get that that gritty Vibes that we're talking about because I actually think that you know if you're going into startup land you can't be soft like you need that grittiness but at the same time sometimes you can get lucky so one of the first times I went to San Francisco I was on the boat but after I went back to Montreal and I was like I never want to sleep on that boat again I had like nightmares so I actually went into a Facebook group that was Canadians in Silicon Valley I was a no one I joined it and I asked hey would anyone be willing to rent me their place in San Francisco an apartment at like a reduced rate and there was a woman and her husband who said yes to me they were starting a company called cloudflare oh my gosh yes so um today I'm just checking the cloud fair is a 20 plus billion dollar company good Lord Michelle's zaitlin and her husband moved into a two-bedroom apartment and they had still this lease to this one bedroom at this studio apartment and they gave it to me for nothing not because I was a kid not because I had a lot of I was well known at all like people will take chances if you shoot your shot if you shoot your shot and you have a few things you can point to right showing some some track record but again most people are unwilling to ask I've during my early New York City days I can't tell you the the amazing people quote unquote successful people that I had coffees with that gave me their time those 30 minutes what happens Greg is you know is most times when people give you that 30 minutes or that 15 minutes folks don't come up prepared I've experienced that I get I get requests all the time for can I get can I pick your brain got 15 minutes the same way you probably get it then I jump on a zoom or I jump on FaceTime and the folks aren't prepared they haven't done their work they don't they don't have specific questions that they can ask so I invite people a hundred percent to to be prepared in those moments because the truth is people are gonna some opportunities do only come once I think you know we have this mindset of you know it's never too late yes it's never too late and the longer you wait to pursue something the harder that it's going to get so this is a reminder for all of us it's something you've done consistently in your life Greg something I've done consistently you got to shoot your shot and you got to shoot it more often you gotta follow up more often some of the life-changing meetings for me that first email that I sent wasn't responded to that second email I sent wasn't responsible sometimes the third or fourth follow-up when they finally get back to you so keep shooting that shot quick Interruption from me if you're listening to this on Apple podcast or Spotify

of man morning yeah well man morning I'll give you some background on it and how it was founded you know seven years ago Greg eight years ago according to the internet your boy Tony was living his best life ever traveling across the world as a speaker publisher or a publisher of published multiple books married newborn twins living That Dope Southern California life with the White House with the white picket fence not far from the beach uh according to the internet I was living my best life ever but behind the scenes my life was a hot mess I was struggling even though my business was successful I had primarily came from a nine to five background and so I didn't know what it really meant to be an entrepreneur I was so I was struggling with the growth of my business which which is a good problem uh a guy that has experienced six different divorces growing up between my mom and dad I was struggling with my marriage you know being married to my wife and we were just going to marriage counselor after marriage counseling not being grown up not having a father growing up for a good period of my life I was struggling to connect with my kids and I found myself in a spiral like a lot of men do I I gained like almost 30 pounds of weight man I had like I grew this big beard to hide the weight gain which which didn't hide the weight by the way fellas if you gained a lot of weight the beard doesn't hide the weight it's just an indicator that you gained weight um found myself drinking a little bit too much in the evenings your boy even became a a secret cigarette smoker behind the scenes amidst all of this again the internet though the internet said your boy was doing great and but I was stuck I was burned out and I started isolating and I when people would ask me how I was doing I said two of the most dangerous words a man could say Greg how you doing two of the most dangerous words someone can say as dudes what do we typically say when we talk to our buddies how you doing haven't seen you online a lot you haven't been posting what's going on I'm fine those are two dangerous words thank goodness because of my community here in Los Angeles we started something called we didn't call it man morning at the time but we started getting together every Thursday at 7 A.M for an hour-long hike or walk and I met with amazing business owners entrepreneurs some were married some weren't some were fathers some weren't but our mission every Thursday was to get together and just make each other better and be there for one another and so I shifted Greg from from isolating and disconnection to being fully connected and being seen and I couldn't hide behind those two words of I'm fine anymore and and since that started seven eight years ago where my life has gone is just just a different magical level of places from business success with multiple books and the speaking of the marriage is like strong and better learn how to be a great father uh and I can tell you other things but what I wanted to do is now just to provide that kind of love and encouragement to other growth-minded men across the country and across the world who do want to get better and maybe they do feel a little bit stuck but they want that ongoing uh place to show up if you will so we started off with a newsletter that's happening right now that goes out every single Sunday and we have a few thousand men on there at man morning where each week she get insight on key areas of life to get better from Health Fitness business Etc we have different man morning chapters growing now all across the country there's a few Global ones as well there's gonna be more coming with that from a community perspective as I continue to learn from everything that you're doing as well and the men for the some of the feedback I've been getting from the men is that they finally feel like they have a place they have a hub where they can actually be honest and and they can be real don't get me wrong this isn't a place where dudes show up and complain and say whoa it's me no these are super successful men that are are reading this and engaging in this but it could be those men that have become a little bit disconnected from their life maybe from their goals Etc and this is just a place to every single week to reset to recharge and to to refuel for people how does someone join the like the Thursday man morning hangout like can they how does that how does that work yeah so the one in Los Angeles uh and so we have our established group but we invite guests so like for example if you're in town like we get permission from the group going back to buying and Trust hey Greg Eisenberg is in town dope dude he's gonna can he join us this week and typically it's all good so you can come join us for that sometimes as attrition happens and people move to different parts of the country we welcome in you know new men into our tribe uh in the newsletter I talk about how people can start their own man in the morning so you got these starting in places like Ohio uh in Northern Florida and Tampa in different areas of Arizona and typically what happens is you pick a day of the week where you get together typically we recommend getting together first thing in the morning seven or eight a.m and that's very intentional Greg because I'm sure you agree with this we found that the conversations that people have at 7 A.M over a cup of coffee or a cup of tea are very different than the conversations you have at 7 pm oh over a cocktail or a beer don't get don't get me wrong we like to have adult beverages as well but the intention when you start your day with this this meet and greet is so powerful and we typically lead each session with one of two questions we'll say share something you're celebrating and share something that you're navigating and that just opens up so much and we also have different type coaching type questions that we also just had our first uh every year we do a big Retreat together we did when we rented a massive Mansion down in San Diego and did that similar to what you know we talked about at the beginning of this talk last year we took not we took all of all of our families to Italy for a couple of weeks so it's just been an amazing experience and the feedback has been powerful where do you want to take man morning so in five years from now best case scenario what does it look like oh that that gets me really excited I think about five years from now uh first and foremost I want to have a strong online community where men know they can show up where they can be seen where they can be heard where they can continue to learn grow and get better and key components of life so there's going to be a really really intentionally strong online community I want a chapter like in every major city all across the United States and hopefully globally as well but also I want to do those in-person events like I want to have like maybe that key like big annual event that happens for man morning you can imagine what that could look like over the course of a couple of days but those Regional events those chapter events as well that are happening for individuals so folks can experience what we talked about at the beginning of this talk you know about intentionally making one another better creating a community of allies that support one another that encourage one another that fire one another up that challenge them and hold them accountable to be the best version of themselves because right now for men isolation disconnection not having a strong community of friends is a real important topic and I I don't want to get too heavy on this but if you look the numbers correct like 80 percent of men commit suicides 80 percent like the suicides that happen is 80 of men and I think a lot of it is because at some point they kept saying the words I'm fine I'm fine but they really weren't and something we take for granted is someone say someone like you Greg we assume because Greg is successful he posts life-changing content for us he has these amazing communities he has amazing things that he's building Greg must be doing great his life must be perfect but you and I both know that you know everything's not not perfect in everyone's life who's winning maybe at business so we want to create a safe place for folks to Come Share what's what's really going on an actual like the people who share the most perfect lives are the ones actually who are the most hurt and are vulnerable in a lot of ways that's a good reminder right there just to check on your friends and even more check on your strong friends yeah check on your successful fans who you think are doing great Greg you and I do something that's so powerful and this with the man morning ethos is all about but I'm gonna invite every person who listens to this to do when you and I get together whenever we get the chance to see one another we both pull our phones out this phone right here we pull it out and we throw that bad boy at airplane mode and there's something about that intentional moment of like I'm going in airplane mode to say that I'm fully here for you I'm fully here for us that's what happens in our man morning meetups right it is so pivotal because it is so rare that that happens and those conversations that we have whether it's 30 minutes we have together for a walk in in Venice or if it's a dinner that we're having like in Hollywood somewhere those airplane mode moments are so powerful yeah I think uh I think we're really starting to see just this trend towards towards in person intimate Gatherings like I feel like we went too deep into the internet for so long that now you're starting to see this trend I mean you mentioned Hampton from Sam par like he's crushing it it's like a seven figure business I assume uh just by a lot of friends there's so many of my friends are in it he charges seven thousand dollars a year and people I know he's doing Retreats now like people want this and I think the cool opportunity for you is like you've defined this uh Mission and you've decided defined your Niche and you have your product which is an IRL product and a digital product um both by the way have retention built in because you're you're man morning weekly Thursday ritual like people are going to want to show up and your your daily email content or your content that's coming in on a ritual basis so I love the and I love the brand too like it's a it's a it's a good brand um so my question to you is what questions you have for me if you're trying to you know grow this thing like what can I what could I answer for you and let's just like live jam on how we could take man morning to the next level yeah I would say I I didn't anticipate this but now um I'm excited the question I have for you man is what what am I probably not thinking about because already you know the feedback from the newsletter is great it's a Weekly Newsletter it started off actually three times a week now we went to weekly and Scott and even better and the next step is building what that Community is going to look like uh a cohort if you will so I'm trying to debate right now for the first step if I want to do like a six week cohort or something like that or even just go all in on a on an annual kind of model where you can sign up for that membership each month and you have XY XYZ deliverables that are happening every single month very similar to I'm sure what happens in Hampton and other you know groups that I've had the opportunity to lead over the years and Retreats I've held internationally so when you look at a community like that what would be your next move as it specifically relates to monetization I think I'll do you one better I'll give you an idea that will help with monetization and it will help increase your newsletter subscriber count win got it I think one of the most underrated channels right now is email based courses email based courses is when you want to teach someone something uh over a period of days via email so I'll give you an example we have a community called you probably need a robot.com it's a AI Community where people learn about productivity we're launching a free email based course it's called five tools five days and so now you can use your social channels Twitter Instagram whatever post about um post about the course and it's free also spend money on like Twitter ads Etc to drive to that and why that's important is it's so hard to grow a newsletter organically right now uh because there's so many people with newsletters so basically what's happening is when people are like if you like this tweet you'll like this newsletter it's like people become blind to it and the way to actually go around that is you do something like an email based course where it's like I'm gonna give you a carrot I'm gonna give you this free course it's normally worth three hundred dollars all you have to do is put in your email once they are in the funnel five day let's say you do a five day course 10 day course around um rediscovering who you are as a man at the end of that course you put them in to something that's called a fomo sequence and the fomo sequence is a one to five email sequence after the free content that upsells them to the premium offering so for example you probably need a robot that five tools five days thing at the end of that we actually created essentially a deeper version of that course five dual uh five tools five days where we're taking the exact same tools but we're going way deeper on each of those tools now why that and then we're selling that course now why that works is because you've given value you've proven to these people that you can create value and they're also kind of hooked on the format they're like wow I'm making this a part of my everyday routine and I don't want to lose it so why I'm a big believer in things like email based courses is gives you the carrot that you can use on social content and also use paid ads against it and then it also gives you the ability to earn trust with this new audience and then it also gives you the ability to upsell them really quickly right after I love that and I love that I already have like something like this that already exists all my my hard drive so that's great and I'm gonna employ that immediately obviously a second question I think this is a very unique question for you based on what you're doing I come from a really analog world where you know my brand for the past 20 years but even past 10 years as a speaker an author has been me I like a lot of people show up to get paid for the group coaching I do with organizations the keynote speaking I do the big organizations across the globe Etc as I think about this newsletter specifically man morning is it possible to do this without my name attached my it seems like what I'm seeing right now in the marketplace from a brand perspective and as I think about late checkout I think about if you need a robot uh it's still Greg but it still has a strong brand and I feel like your stuff could still exist even if Greg wasn't in the signature so is it possible how critical is it to have me attached to it so it's a great question I think initially it's helpful to have you be attached to it because like you're on a podcast right now if we get a hundred thousand downloads plus a month on our podcast a bunch of these people are gonna listen to it and they're gonna be like oh Tony like I've resonated with that guy man morning I resonate with that concept boom I'm gonna give my email address in so it's helpful that that you're out there screaming about what you're doing and the truth of the matter is people resonate with people more than they resonate with brands that being said I don't think that you necessarily need to be that person um long term so I think that you can like shift out of it at one point so one option is you shift out of it once you are starting to see I don't know 50 100 000 Subs multiple major cities um that are really working in different chapters and then you just kind of like shift out of it and then you just employ like a Toastmasters model which is like there's no person behind Toastmasters yet Toastmasters is an incredibly big but you know business I think is a non-profit probably does tens of millions a year in Revenue if not hundreds of millions of dollars a year in revenue and there's no person behind it people just show up to these events pay pay their dues to be a part of it the other opportunity that you have is you've essentially built a prototype that works and a product that works and the question is who would be the most interesting Creator to be attached to this company or or product so for example you know I used to work with these guys Adam and Jordan Bornstein they actually used to produce this podcast and they just launched a newsletter for Arnold Schwarzenegger wow no I haven't they launched it like recently like within the last like 90 days and it has like half a million subscribers wow now that's a big deal because when you look at products like uh morning brew that sold a majority of their business for 75 million dollars or the hustle which I think sold for 20 or 30 million dollars when the you know when the hustle sold I think they had like a million and a half Subs so or when morning Brew sold I think they had like a couple million Subs so Arnold Schwarzenegger has basically made like eight figures of of potential value via leveraging his name and creating this newsletter now my question to you is if you can have any Creator celebrity to attach to this who who would it be and why yeah that's a that's a fantastic question and I do not have an answer for you right now on that but that's going to be a good thought experiment for me because when I think about the ethos of the brand what it's about what it's not about I know the demographics of this guy extremely well who who we're talking to so now it's for me to transfer that to who who is that man out there that exists right now so that's that's a dope exercise I'm going to do and I'm going to give you uh an update on that soon I have a last question for you and I don't always get to see what's going on behind this scene we get to talk offline obviously quite a bit as well as I think about this next chapter and working with man morning and have a vision for other newsletters down the road Etc targeting targeting men what's your perspective on if one should pursue having a partner in something like this or delegating higher pros of course there's a lot of great newsletter agencies out there right now and people you can write checks to to implement and do certain things uh when you course when you look at say that the morning Brew motto or the hustle looks like you always had strong tandems you know strong partners that were doing things together as you look at me would you say Tony you're going to go further if you're not doing this this Jam by yourself I mean you always go further when you're not doing it yourself I think you want to have bright Minds at the table who've done this zero to one before they don't necessarily need to have you know worked at Facebook or Google I actually think that's like a red flag you know you you I'd rather I much prefer like they've you know I was telling I was telling this to Rob Sandy actually who we talked about in the beginning of the call right before this he you know he's trying to hire uh someone on his team and there's a difference between hiring someone zero to one and and hiring someone who's you know just optimizing something that's working and I think if I'm you all I'm thinking about is how do I get zero to one because if you get to one and you have real product Market fit that that's really taking it off taking off both on um physical and digital this is a thing that could scale to hundreds of millions of people so I think if I'm you I'm open to either I think uh how I would approach like my framework for thinking about do I need a partner is what am I really good at what am I missing if you find someone who fills those gaps who's the Yang to your ying you know is it worth giving up a percentage of of the business to accelerate it and have them thinking about it 24 7 like probably um your other option is go to agencies like with a lot of our uh I've been sending this publicly or anything but there's a lot of like our um like you probably need a robot and things like that like we've hired agencies to run uh a lot of it uh for example content and stuff like that and I'm not afraid of hiring as an agency guy now who owns a bunch of agencies I'm also not afraid to hire a bunch of agencies like no one hires more agencies than us because we like we're kind of like yeah it's a it's the the most amount of equity you're gonna give away is going to be now pre-product Market fit so therefore I'd much rather spend a little bit get further along prove that and then have to give up less Equity after no that's that's great advice and I love that the agency hires agencies that's what's up totally I mean we bought an agency in 2022 as a result of we were hiring this agency they were amazing and we're like hey like can we work more closely together and that might happen to you you might be like wow I found this incredible agency that does newsletter growth and I need them on my team to be thinking about this all the time and I think if I'm you I'm trying to think of like don't don't look at big agencies look at like these are three to five people eight people 12 people small that have something to prove are gritty want to make this work hold them accountable to a kpi be like I need my number like I'm making this up but you need to I want 50 000 high quality subscribers by this day and all of our efforts need to be focused on that if you hit that that is going to be successful and I want to like double down with you if you don't I don't I don't know we'll have to revisit it yeah that's good so the three key takeaways I'm getting from you is one the email course that's going to come out fast uh for now it's gonna be me your boy Tony as the brand and I'm gonna identify who that other person or people could be down the road in three yeah as even as you say that I'm more excited about that Prospect of working with agencies I can write a check now versus like you say giving up Equity uh long term so those are three three great insights for you man I appreciate it what's the um what's the address where I send the check for that no address I'm I dude like I'm I'm the biggest Tony uh Tony fan so I I love what you're doing I love uh the concept like I actually think it you know has a lot of legs I I had uh Natalie Ellis on on the podcast about five months ago she she runs a she started off as like an Instagram account called boss babe Inc and now it's like 3.4 million followers jeez and it's all about female entrepreneurship and and accelerating that Journey for a lot of a lot of folks and getting them excited and providing them with tools resources and community help them get there and the business is massive if people are listening to this and you've made it to the deep end here uh you know check out that interview because she's making millions of dollars a year and she's like kind of living the dream for her and I think you can actually do the same thing where you're providing these physical and IR physical and digital experiences you bring it all together with this email there's retention there you're providing tools Community content and I think you've also dialed into this trend that like Sam par and others are dialing into which is people just want IRL and they want intimate this is very helpful man I'm fired of right now and I can't wait to listen to that episode and your boy is gonna be grinding this weekend so I appreciate it man thanks for coming on man where could folks find you and man morning and and get involved yeah man morning.com like the beginning of the day man morning.com and everything uh me is uh at the Antonio nevs that's a handle on all socials at the Antonio nevs I love it and can you tell people to subscribe to to this YouTube channel if they're just like ask them to subscribe hey everybody if you're listening right now like Greg said you made it to the deep end odds are you've got value out of this or some other content that Greg has provided you with not only this month but probably last month and over the years it costs you absolutely nothing right now to smash that subscribe button and it helps Greg and the work that he does so he can continue publish free amazing content like this for you so not only are you gonna press that subscribe button but share this episode with a friend as well I knew I knew you'd crush it because you were on TV so that was like for me that was like I'm watching a Nickelodeon TV ad

AI-generated content can't replace human storytelling.

one thing that I'm also thinking with AI there needs that human element they call it the aura Theory so for example I listen to a lot of this AI Drake stuff going on and some of the songs are crazy like if Drake's saying it I'd be like this is the top five song of Drake like they're incredible just doesn't hit the same as knowing that actual Drake made this song so I think the same thing is going to happen where there's going to be these incredible AI generated movies and scripts but I just don't think there's going to be as large an appetite as people think of for audiences to consume this because what we really crave beneath it all is the story is that human element the story behind the artist behind the Creator don't think it'll have this end-all be all effect that people are thinking I think the human element the creativity or Ingenuity I think it'll always be desired and craved and it'll always be most important

you can't hire the best SEO person in the world for a hundred thousand dollars a year you probably can't hire them for a million dollars a year to be perfectly honest you almost have to get the best people incentivized upside Equity that kind of partnership but it can be really complex structuring a deal where kind of connect on a personal level and you guys are aligned I almost think of every deal I do should almost be a handshake deal you should almost agree on a handshake basis and then you obviously have to legalize it all up but you almost have to agree on a handshake and sort of bigger picture level before you go into anything

a great brand on top of a great Community or on top of a great platform is the key to success if you just have a great name a great name on its own doesn't do much but that in tandem has helped me a bit made me a bit more memorable if I would have picked a shittier name maybe I would have got 10 or 20 percent less revenue or deals or connections

[Music] [Music] thank you all right so welcome Harry Harry Campbell the Rideshare guy thanks for having me on Greg how are you so I remember hearing your story 2015 2016. um I had heard that there was this guy named the Rideshare guy who was a an Uber driver I think who started a Blog that was getting a ton of traction in 2014 I was working full-time as an aerospace engineer for Boeing but I decided to start driving for Uber and Lyft on the side and while it's not rocket science being a driver it is tougher than it looks as an engineer though I was very diligent about tracking my income and expenses and constantly experimenting with new strategies and even new opportunities in the gig economy like food delivery and scooter charging along the way I started a Blog to document everything I was learning and to share my journey with other drivers I called it the Rideshare guy Lyft actually turned me on to you so I was building a community platform at the time and they basically were like hey there's this guy who's like doing stuff for Uber and like you need to like we want to compete against him and I was like oh what is happening so anyways I heard about you mythical status and I wanted to bring you on the show to talk about a bit of your story and how you can yeah and and what you're up to cool well I guess my first question to you is what took you so long to have me on if you heard about me in 2015 or 16 I guess better late than never right I mean you know there's the the adage never meet your Heroes and yeah I I I've actually in my past have kind of waited not you know to meet people I've followed and over the last year or two with this pod it's given me a great excuse to just like hit people up and be like hey do you want to chat for sure I know I feel like there's so many cool people doing interesting things like the podcast is probably the perfect Outlet or venue you know like we could have a good conversation we might as well record it so other people can hear so as a podcast host myself of a couple different podcasts right now I can definitely empathize with you there you go so for for people who don't know about you can you give a little background about uh what your you know I'll call it a media Empire around uh the Greek economy is and what what's the scale today definitely yeah no and I appreciate uh that term because it is a little bit tough to describe what I do and I mean really kind of what it boils down to though is you know I started driving for both Uber and Lyft all the way back in 2014 on the side you know just to try it out make some money I had a full-time day job as an aerospace engineer working for Boeing so kind of the opposite of what I do now but uh obviously during that time period the company started exploding raising crazy amounts of money hiring hundreds of thousands of drivers and you know I was really just like a leech on this rocket this rocket ship and so the companies exploded and you know I think really um because there were so many people out there and this job was new too right like people had driven taxi people had driven cars but driving for hire in this kind of fashion was so new there was just so much interest and excitement around it and so I kind of latched on to that I started my blog I started doing three or four articles a week myself and um you know I started a YouTube channel I started a podcast the Rideshare guy podcast which I still run uh to this day so it's sort of a weekly podcast a little bit more focused on ride share and gig delivery industry topics these days and kind of like I started off as like Nitty Gritty I went out and drove Friday Saturday Sunday night here's how much I made um you know this person puked in my car here's how to avoid a puker you know and I will say there is like no shortage of topic uh of content and topics that you can kind of cover you would think like how hard is it to be a driver but really it is kind of a lot harder than it looks and it's not rocket science but I think I kind of just took advantage of the fact that there's so many people doing it it was growing so fast and people didn't really know what they were doing and it's a little harder than it looks and so over the years I've built out a team of contributors were on probably every box on the internet you know we've got the Blog podcast we've got a couple different podcasts YouTube is probably our fastest growing platform right now we have I just got our monthly ports I think we have about 150 160 000 subscribers which is you know not huge but a pretty good size you can make a full-time living off of that we do around a million uh views a month on YouTube seventy five thousand email subscribers um so you know it's basically to say we've got a pretty good reach across all our different platforms you know we kind of we've got the tick tock Instagram you know all of that we've got the courses for drivers we've got audio books Kindle books uh kind of I usually joke like any box on the internet if you type in something related to Uber Lyft gig economy will probably Pop Up For Better or Worse so that's kind of what the business uh looks like today and I'm happy to dive into that or sort of what I've what I've kind of transitioned to focus more on but that's kind of the high level right now over the last 12 months there's been this trend on you know for these Anonymous accounts um people are calling it the guy Mafia oh yeah they totally uh or I'm totally on board with the guy Mafia yeah so what they mean by that is like the strip mall guy the Self Storage guy the designer guy and uh you know you really pioneered that concept I think um how do you how important do you think the name the Rideshare guy was to unlocking a lot of the success in their early days yeah so I will say I totally ripped it off from one of my Idols the points guy so I was a big uh before I ever started the Rideshare guy you know I've always been dabbling in online businesses you know I started three personal finance blogs I was doing freelance travel writing just kind of covering topics that I was interested in and I kind of feel like you know I wasn't an expert from all of those you know businesses or gigs that I that I did but you know I learned a lot and kind of like got my feet wet I guess you would say and so I totally loved the points guy was like the only travel blog I read and you know it's when I kind of started brainstorming ideas and names for my site the Rideshare guy kind of rose to the top of the list and I wouldn't say that it you know like when you introduced me you said the Rideshare guy like I walked into rooms that Lyft and Uber and they're like oh it's the Rideshare guy so it definitely there's something there with the branding but I think that uh you know like a great brand on top of a great Community or on top of a great platform is like the key to success right if you just have a great name it you know not like rock you know any Revelation or anything like a great name on its own doesn't do much but I think like that kind of in tandem I think has uh you know helped me a bit made me a bit more memorable so I'd say it's in like that 10 to 20 percent range that it's given me like a little bit of boost like if I would have picked a shittier name maybe I would have got 10 or 20 percent less revenue or deals or connections I think it did have an impact but maybe not a huge one you know my take on that is I think it had more than a 10 or 20 lift I think a name is like naming in general is just really underrated um especially when you were coming up with this name like the points guy was pretty massive but like you know it wasn't as ubiquitous as it is now I actually think what's gonna happen with the guy Mafia is there's there's almost like a saturation I I do I kind of on my on one of my podcasts that I'm doing right now called wannabe Angels which I think is another good name for investor you know it's like an investor podcast and uh I think we always joke like the best part about that podcast is the name and uh I always mention it you know we have a vertical SAS guy I'm like oh you should be the vertical SAS guy and with this whole Twitter guy Mafia I think there was a car dealership guy who I follow and you know I think I saw this uh another guy Nick Huber sweaty startup uh he tweeted out some list of accounts to follow the other day and it was all like the blank guy and I'm like oh man people are really leaning into this guy Mafia and I mean it does sound good but I do think yeah some of the novelty and cachet is probably wearing off like I I don't know that I would name the you know a business the blank guy today because it does you know it's a little bit saturated at this point right like it stood out when I did it when you're coming up with a name for a business do you have any naming Frameworks or how do you come up with names for companies products podcasts communities I feel like in general I either let someone else smarter than me or more creative than me come up with a name and work with them so my co-founder for my conference Jonah he came up with a name called curbivore uh because it's sort of at the intersection of last mile delivery and policy and restaurants and Retail everything that's happening at the curb you know right he'll pick up and drop off so we do an in-person event in LA and everybody loves the name herbivore uh you know sort of like play off of herbivore but you know eating the curb and other than that though like when I came up with the Rideshare guy name and wannabe angels with my co-host Colin for that podcast I think we just wrote down like for Rideshare guy I specifically remember writing down like a list of 50 different names and I think the key that I've discovered with naming is you kind of want to be Niche but you don't want to be too Niche you don't want to be too broad like the I knew for sure that I didn't want to be like the Uber guy because I was like well what if there's another company Beyond Uber right and so you know I think Rideshare guy was sort of like a little bit lucky that I picked the right Niche but you know for a while in 2018 and 19 our most popular content on both the blog and YouTube was actually scooter content when bird and lime and all these companies were exploding and so I was sort of like oh man everything everyone thinks of me as the Rideshare guy but like our most popular content is All About Scooters now and charging scooters and in the last two three years honestly we've had a lot it's probably 50 50 now but like we have a ton of interest in delivery and so you know people still think of me as the Rideshare guy but like half of our revenue and traffic probably comes from you know last mile delivery now so ubereats instacart doordash you know those types of topics so I think to me I think about it like hey I don't want to be an expert in every one of these domains I want people to think of me as the Rideshare guy anything any Uber or Lyft question come to me I'm the guy to talk to uh but you know we also dabble we know enough to be dangerous in some other areas like food delivery and even though you know I might know quite a bit about food delivery I'm not really trying to like actively Market myself as like the food delivery guy if that makes sense yeah I mean would you ever consider sort of unbundling the Rideshare guy into multiple accounts slash businesses so I thought about it when the scooter craze was happening because it was you know it was still gig work but I mean we were doing YouTube reviews of scooters and posting it on the Rideshare guy YouTube channel so you have like a video about how to drive for Uber and then the next video is like a scooter review right pretty random but our scooter reviews were getting hundreds of thousands of views so I was like all right well I kind of have to do this and I think what I've learned over the years is you to segment audience you really have to have a big following I think it sounds great in online marketing you know if you've got an email provider they're like hey you should take your Rideshare people you should take your delivery people you should take your full time who likes videos who like articles and create all these different segments and in order to do that you have to have like a massive following I would say like in the millions of people in the hundreds of thousands maybe to really start segmenting like the only segment we do is like ride share and delivery right so we have like two really high level segments and um I've experimented with a lot of different others and it's just so much work that goes into like managing those different segments like if you launch a brand new account unless you've got like unless I had a million subscribers on YouTube I think that it would be really difficult to kind of get those economies of scale from launching a second Channel I think you see like Mr Beast he's got his main Channel and he's got his philanthropy Channel and that works out really well but he's the biggest and best Creator on all of YouTube right like I'm way below Mr P so I think that would be kind of my personal experience and caution is that it sounds so good on paper or on a PDF or you know when you're taking an online course like oh segment this and that but in reality it's a lot of work and I don't really recommend it unless you have a huge huge following so what advice would you give to let's say a sweaty startup Nick Huber who you know is running 10 10 guy accounts companies right now and really took your branding advice to Heart yeah I mean I guess maybe I should be taking advice from him because he seems to be doing pretty well but uh I think it was someone like him I think that he's kind of unlocked a strategy that seems to be working pretty well and leveraging either his main account his main Persona and you know I think he might be kind of at that inflection point where he is big enough to uh you know kind of go and launch these other brands and I think as long as you're still doing something that you enjoy you know there's still a business opportunity and you're kind of able to leverage other properties that to me is the big thing and everyone is different you know like to me I'm all about like high leverage working as little as possible and making as much money as possible but that not everyone is like that and I think sometimes people try to force themselves into you know a certain pigeonhole but you know if that's not your like if you're the grind it out type of personality you probably shouldn't be doing things like me where like I won't even DocuSign something I'll send that to one of my virtual assistants because it saves me you know five seconds if it's like a basic document could you talk more about the business model of the whole of the whole sure companies so you've got all these content you know properties um and and you know you mentioned courses I'm sure there's ad Revenue like how do you how do you think about business model and when did you think about business model yeah so I would say to answer the when is you know I've done a lot of content over the years and content is tough because I think most people don't think of it as a product right when you think about a company forming you've got CEO Chief Operating Officer Chief product officer there's no Chief content there's a chief marketing right but it's usually less on the content and more on paid there's you know not there's very rarely a chief content officer but I think to me like I think if you're going to do content you have to think of it as a product you have to think of it in those other veins and I think that if you do it well it's tough um it can have similar returns it can be valuable it's not as competitive right if not a lot of people are doing something that means that if you do it really well you can kind of get outsized returns and so for me when I started the Rideshare guy I think really in any project that I do the three things I look for is something that I'm interested in something that has a good business potential and something that's going to help people I rarely will do anything in my entire life that's like one of those three categories it's always you know something more than the other right I go I just got a text message to take a GLG investor call right like okay that's going to be more for the money than it is to you know like help people I'm still helping someone but it's someone who runs like a multi-billion dollar hedge fund do they really need my help I'm probably doing that one more for the money okay um but every project those are kind of like the three you know sort of you're drawing a Venn diagram those are the three things that I look for and so when I started the Rideshare guy I thought there was a good business opportunity I thought it'd be really cool to help a bunch of people who are like trying to figure out uh this new line of work and I just frankly I think gig work is really cool uh you know I want to kind of share it with more people and obviously there's millions of people doing it now so there's something that people enjoy about it and I wasn't really expecting to make much money at the start uh you know I kind of in general with content I always tell people like do it for a year pick something you like pick something that has a good business opportunity and see what happens but at the end of that year I think you should sort of be happy with the journey and the results and if you made money along the way great if it exploded into a huge business even better and so that was kind of my initial uh framework going into the Rideshare guy and within about three to six months I did start making some money and that was more off of driver referrals so Uber and Lyft kind of have famously paid thousands of dollars for driver acquisition over the years and now it's kind of come down maybe more normal acquisition prices hundreds of dollars for a driver and so over the years we kind of started off monetizing by mainly driver referrals some affiliate stuff which would be you know a gas uh app like get upside is one of our top affiliate Partners you know they help you save on gas so pretty good fit obviously for Uber and Lyft drivers who put a thousand to two thousand miles a week on their car and so today we have three or four main Revenue sources probably the biggest one would be affiliate so that would be you know either signing people up I kind of call it affiliate you know signing people up to drive for Uber ubereats instacart doordash and you know really any kind of platform um signing them up to be a driver that kind of falls under affiliate and then we also have other Affiliates like get upside uh others in the cashback space like Ibotta fetch I mean I think in like one of our um you know get upside is a good example because they were sort of VC funded had a lot of money at a certain point and I think they were paying us like five dollars um you know acquisition for a free app download for like a perfect product for our audience right and I think at one point we probably did 50 000 referrals in a single month for them at like the Heyday two three years ago when they were spending a lot on marketing and you know kind of we were ranking number one for every code around get upside get upside You Know download get upside referral promo code all of that and uh you know so the affiliate stuff is definitely temperamental and kind of goes up and down and I can pull the plug at any time but affiliate is probably our main one and we also do a lot of direct advertising and so over the past two three years we've done a lot of direct campaigns with you know the platforms themselves so some companies we might be an affiliate and they're like hey you're doing great as an affiliate let's do some extra work with you others like right now we have a few deals working with a lot of fintech apps right new banking apps for Gig workers you know combine your personal and business accounts you know get a cash advance or whatever it might be so we do a lot of uh direct deals and so that would be they come to us and maybe sponsor our newsletter sponsor uh do a sponsored blog post sponsored video maybe we'll do a pre-roll ad for them you know we've got like 10 or 20 different options that they can do that we have a weekly live show that they can sponsor and have a banner so I think that's pretty straightforward and then we have some other ancillary uh Revenue sources like I'll do Consulting deals retainers one-off calls we do have some products so we sell to drivers directly but honestly that's probably less than five percent of our Revenue like our courses and coaching and it's just been really tough for me to sell directly to drivers who frankly aren't making a lot of money we've had much more success you know negotiating with the bigger companies or VC funded or you know people with a lot of money to blow or to spend basically and you know then I also work with a lot of startups and so I guess that would be Less on the money side and you know I'm an advisor for 10 or 15 startups um I've been Angel Investing for the past three four years and I ended up starting a little mini fund so investing in some companies so you know I guess I haven't really made money off of that yet but hopefully someday I will on the affiliate side of things what what does like an Uber pay for a referral to you know for a driver just give people a sense of like so probably one to two hundred dollars I mean in the Heyday they were paying 500 to a thousand dollars and that's sort of where like I kind of feel like I had a little bit of a cheat code in the first few years like I shouldn't have been making I ended up quitting my day job within about nine months starting the Rideshare guy and I in a normal situation I probably shouldn't have been able to do that Uber was kind of like a once in a generation kind of company where they were growing so fast and raising so much money that they were just paying you know literally 500 to a thousand dollars for driver referrals and they were double-sided so like the new driver signing up was getting money I was getting a lot of money um and so we kind of monetized off of that so these days it's come down quite a bit and so maybe more in the one to two hundred dollars range for delivery services it might be 25 to 100 maybe up to 200 and some of the top markets but sort of Rideshare delivery and then you know all of our other Affiliates might be more in like the five to fifty dollar range you know if it's a free mileage tracking app you know that might be two to five dollars per download if it's more of a bank account you know that might be more than the 50 to 100 dollar a kind of Rage and where do you want to take it like what's exciting to you it feels like you've kind of like from an outsider honestly it feels like you're you're at the top like you're at the top of your Niche yeah and you've got like you're doing the courses you're doing the affiliate you're on all the platforms you've got a bunch of shows I'm sure you're making six to seven figures in Revenue a month on the business it sounds like you've got it pretty much like you want you know you've won you beat Bowser you know I don't know if we're making quite that much I'd be doing real well if we're that probably more like five to six figures a month but you know I think that uh definitely to me I would say that like I am definitely an entrepreneur at heart and so I've really kind of used the Rideshare guy it's just like like you know I think obviously you can see a lot of the work that I put in and you know this isn't my first rodeo it wasn't my first you know I have many businesses that failed right or many blogs or websites that didn't work out so well but I think it's like such a good springboard into other Ventures right and so really any kind of itch that I want to scratch as an entrepreneur I've sort of been using the Rideshare guy to do that over the past few years and I would say probably the biggest examples maybe more directly to the business would be you know like electrification we're really interested in like EVs and that intersections we've done a lot of of Consulting work you know reviews of different Vehicles you know so we're kind of investing we started a Facebook group that has six seven thousand or five six thousand EV Uber and Lyft drivers is like the only and kind of biggest group there so that's kind of like an area that I just was spending some time that I kind of invested time money resources and then uh the conference that I mentioned like I've done everything primarily digital you can make way more money Better Or Not way more but better uh returns you know I would say like marginal returns I guess you would say and so you know I wanted to do something in person bring people together and so the conference we've been putting on we've done it now two years in person in La our most recent one had 750 people um and that is really kind of at the intersection of last mile delivery restaurant and retail public policy and kind of anything and everything in between and frankly it's just like a really good excuse for me and my co-founder Jonah to put on an awesome party to bring a lot of people together to have really great food like I literally do that conference for myself like I don't do anything at that conference that's boring not fun you know we make some money off of it but it's not my biggest Revenue source and then uh the other area that I've kind of been personally interested in over the past few years is Angel Investing and you know I really you know I'm not going to go start a startup anytime soon I'm way too lazy for that way too much work but I do get a lot of energy out of helping entrepreneurs you know seeing people grow and you know maybe passing some of my knowledge and frankly like I think it's infectious to be around people that are like working their ass off if you don't necessarily have to do it yourself so it's sort of fun to be involved in that process and journey and you know so I've invested probably five or six hundred thousand dollars of my own money in 10 20 to 30 startups and maybe 10 funds over the past three four years and ended up uh meeting my friend Colin uh and we started a podcast called wannabe angels and so I think we've record we're about 15 published and maybe 20 episodes total in and that is to kind of scratch that itch but you know as you might imagine like the companies that I'm investing in I'm not you know I'm like investing in you know maybe less ride like Rideshare adjacent you know like gig economy food restaurant and retail Logistics Mobility you know anything that kind of like leans into these areas that you know I know a little bit you know enough to be dangerous about but maybe I'm not an expert in so I think that's kind of where I'm at in the stage of the business and I did actually just bring on a big business partner too to kind of help run the website of uh and the kind of back-end side of things we've got some goals there which we can get into but I guess on a personal level that's kind of like what I've been dabbling in so the points guys an interesting story um so Points Guy started very similar to you I think it was he worked at um Brian Kelly he was an investment banker yeah yeah investment banker at you know JP Morgan or something like that Morgan Stanley actually and you know he just started blogging about you know points on different credit cards and uh it was right you know right around the right after the uh great financial crisis so there was a lot of demand for you know saving money and and you know just points um and he ended up taking a different path than you did um although he did monetize via Affiliates like you did but the different path that he took is he sold his business to bank rate right uh in 2012. um which I think got acquired again in 2017. have you ever thought about it right yeah yeah exactly have you ever thought about I'm sure you have but like when is the right time to sell yeah or how are you thinking about it yeah so I this is probably I I would love to discuss this but I'll sort of caveat it with that I'm definitely not an expert here and that's kind of one of the reasons that kind of interests me about it like I've never sold a business and so like as an entrepreneur I think you know you kind of always want to work on new things try new things and so for me it's like I've done all these different things I've never sold Rideshare guy or never sold a business so it's like kind of that part is like almost more interesting of course I want to make money off of it if I do sell and I think like up until this point I've always up until recently I guess you would say I've always thought about uh my business as like I probably value it a lot more than someone is willing to pay like hey if Uber came and offered me I don't know 10 20 50 million dollars for it tomorrow I'd probably sell it but I doubt that they value it in the same way that I do right because I put so much time and energy and you know like I also like what I do you know like every like I only work on parts of the business that you know I enjoy and you know I've kind of transitioned and done a lot of different roles and hired people and all of that so like I wake up every Monday morning like pretty refreshed you know I just went on vacation last week and I was pretty excited you know to come back to work and check all my emails right because I knew it'd be like kind of fun stuff you know Greg emailing me about coming on the podcast you know fun stuff to do so I think like when it comes to selling the business I've never you know it's never been a goal of mine by any stretch but I've definitely over the past two to four years built the business to sell I would say that you know I think I think there's a famous saying like even if you're not going to sell a business you know you want to build it to sell um and really what that means for me personally is you know there's the brand the rides your guy people know me that's how they think of me but if you go and look at our videos our content I've got a number of contributors it's really not me anymore doing the content I'm still you know not even in the face but I'm still involved you know people still know me but I think that like if someone did want to come in and buy the Rideshare guy tomorrow it wouldn't be like they're buying me I think they're buying a brand you know most of the time if we get a media inquiry you know I've been quoted like over 3000 times in the media you know as a Rideshare gig economy expert but these days you know when we get a media inquiry I send it to one of my top contributors I don't even take those unless I have some pre-existing relationship with the reporter you know I want and actually like kind of stealing from the Points Guy I remember I heard this NPR interview once and they're like we're going to bring in you know senior contributor at the Points Guy Kelly some something you know Kelly whoever and she's going to talk about points and I was like that's awesome like the points guys getting mentioned in this NPR uh story and Brian the CEO or you know founder doesn't even have to be on the interview like that is really cool to me and so that's kind of how you know I think I've done a pretty good job of that over the past few years and I actually ended up um bringing on a business partner earlier this year uh they're called MMG media they've bought and sold a bunch of properties and they've exited uh businesses and their five-person team that have been really enjoying working with and really it's to kind of take have them take over a lot of the back end I think the things that would be even more attractive to a potential acquirer right like they're going to care a lot more about affiliate Revenue than upfront sponsored you know like advertising deals right like they kind of care more about um those longer term type things and so you know really kind of building the business you know I've never been an expert like I know I know the basics of SEO but like that's like my nightmare I don't want to sit there tracking keywords and doing all the boring stuff and I'm really good at like getting out there marketing developing relationships making a lot of noise uh you know being quoted in the media writing op-eds you know being having content everywhere and less so like hey you know we covered this topic three years ago and you know this new post is going to kind of cannibalize our old posts in the eyes of Google search we should probably update this old one you know but that's sort of why I brought on my business partners they're very good at that type of stuff so I guess I would say that you know regardless if we end up do if we end up selling or not I think we're kind of like building the business behind the scenes now in a much more attract like I was able to kind of take the business to a point where I think it's like somewhat attractive from the outside because it's not just me anymore but now we're trying to build the business behind the scenes that's even more attractive if we were to want to sell in the future so this is the first time I've heard about MMG media and they look awesome yeah I'm just on their website I'm just on their website so I haven't really announced my partnership without I've kind of mentioned it or teased it and you know I'm sure we'll kind of announce it a little bit more uh I guess you're getting the exclusive right now Greg I love it I love it you're too good to me on their website it says we are obsessed with building notable brands that meet people where they are in their financial Journey and they build by they you know they basically have three services they either number one they build or buy number two they scale and number three they sell so cell meaning they've got strong relationships with the network of buyers yeah our team has yeah scaling is basically I think similar in your your boat where we grow revenue and traffic with a heavy emphasis on SEO and affiliate Partnerships uh and then the build and buy and they've got a portfolio that looks like bankbonus.com uh Millennial money uh Financial residency and of course the ride share guy can you talk us through your like your relationship with them and what they handle and how it's been yeah definitely so Grant uh the CEO I've known for a while since I sort of got my bearings in the personal finance world and you can sort of tell from the sites they listed off they've got you know they've been kind of more focused on the finance side of things and I think Millennial money is kind of their famous site that uh if you look up I believe he talked he has a blog post or two about him selling it to I want to say gosh I can't remember it wasn't Bank grade but it was someone like that that he sold it to and I don't think he announced the price but I think he announced you know it was a lot of money and I mean I think he ended up buying it back at some point too uh which is kind of funny um but yeah I mean so I've sort of personally known him for a while and I guess to me like Santa kind of seen them like you know you kind of listed off all the marketing copy on their site and I've kind of seen that in action so that's sort of where it's like hey to me you know that it's not that hard to write that on a website and create good copy and landing page but like to me you know the reason why I was even interested in partnering with them in the first place is because I've seen them do that in action build a site like Bank bonus from the ground up you know build his own site sell it and uh you know kind of do some of that and they've got a lot of experience and are good at some of the things that I'm not good at and so I sort of feel like it was like kind of fitting two good pieces of a puzzle and so at a high level that's kind of what interested me in the first place uh in working with them and uh basically we are still I mean we've got an official partnership agreement and all that and they're kind of my official business partners but I will say you know kind of like integrating a business like mine that's been doing something you know in all our different ways for 10 years almost is like you know it's there's a lot of moving pieces right and so basically we're kind of at the stage where they're really focused on the website and SEO and we've kind of actually completely redesigned the site back-end architecture redone hundreds if not probably close to 2 000 pages on the website and optimize for SEO you know we're starting I'm about to record a bunch of you know like really high quality videos with a videographer for our top seven SEO affiliate type pages so we're really just trying at this point to like build up the traffic you know it was kind of like hey we've got this ship and now we're kind of writing it in the correct direction not that we were doing a bad job before but you know if you look at like how much money can you make driving for doordash that's probably like a top keyword uh for doordash Affiliates and there's a lot of sites with lower domain Authority less credibility than us out ranking because as the SEO side of things has never been my area of expertise Focus or something that frankly I even enjoyed and so it's sort of like hey I knew we were always leaving some money on the table but you know I like working on things that I enjoy and that I'm good at and so that's kind of where we're at with them and basically I kind of brought they've got a five-person team and I brought them all on as you know sort of like a uh equity and I guess you would say sort of I mean they're basically like a 50 50 partner I guess you would say and so they are uh have a lot of upside in the business if we do really well if we exit uh whatever it might be and so that's kind of uh you know what they're handling for me I feel like this is a model that's gonna happen a ton in a bunch of other niches so what I really like about the deal that I set up with Grant and his team is that I'm really I'm paying them nothing up front like they are really putting their money where their mouth is and they have a lot of upside but it if you know things don't work out if they're not gonna make any money and so it's sort of like combining right like I think a good example like I do a lot of stuff with the media and I usually kind of like Workhorse it myself and you know like work with the startups and companies like get them featured or whatever it might be and there's a million PR Services out there you can hire for thousands or tens of thousands of dollars and none of them will guarantee anything right so it's like you could pay someone a lot of money with no guarantee of results and to me like that's like a space where there are definitely some good people but I feel like a majority are just gonna you know kind of like talk about talk a big game and it'll sound really good and you'll end up wasting your money um and I think in the deal that I set up with them with MMG media they have a lot of upside you know sort of like they've got that social proof but then they're putting their money where their mouth is and to me I think the biggest uh you know reason why it's a good fit is because like what they bring to the table and what I bring to the table are two really good skills but different like I'm good on the content and creative and relationship and marketing and they're kind of good on like what I would like joke the more boring stuff like you can't hire the best SEO person in the world for a hundred thousand dollars a year you probably can't hire them for a million dollars a year to be perfectly honest like you almost have to get the best people you know incentivized upside Equity you know that kind of partnership but it can be really you know complex structuring a deal where you know you kind of connect on a personal level and you guys are aligned like on a you know I almost think of like every deal I do should almost be like a handshake deal you know like you should almost like agree on a handshake basis and then you obviously have to like legalize it all up but you know it's like you you kind of almost have to like agree on like a handshake and like sort of bigger picture level you know before you go into anything I had a call earlier this morning with a entrepreneur who has a partnership opportunity on the table he's got you know a pretty good business and he he doesn't know if he should bring them on as Equity partners and he's got this big fear that well what if you know what they say they're gonna do is not exactly what they're going to do and you know um what advice do you have to someone like that I mean I think that that is a very reasonable fear I feel like most Partnerships don't work out to be perfectly honest you know like uh whether it's like a personal relationship or a Business Partnership like business I mean literally you know any anytime you bring two people together right or two groups together it's like tough it's like you know what I mean whether it's personal or where you know like obviously right was the stat 50 of marriages end in divorce right like I'm sure that it's higher or I don't know if I'm sure I'm sure it's in the same ballpark for business relationships based off my personal experience like you know when you get started with something it's just hard to maintain over time and so I think if you kind of go into it like to me it's all about leveling up like I've I feel like there's like 10 different things that happened in my life in order to get me to say yes to this partnership with MMG media you know the first thing would be like hey I've done a good job building something up on my own but I think to get it to that next level I've tried and I haven't quite you know been able to do it on my own higher hearing the people that you know I've been hiring number two I've done a lot of business Partnerships uh you know sort of like starting my first course that I started like eight nine years ago you know we started off with another guy and it ended up like after two three years we sort of broke up and it was somewhat amicable and I think I kind of paid him off paid him out of the business but you know it was like I don't think we had an actual agreement for that like my herbivore conference co-founder we usually at the end of every year we like decide how we want to divvy up the money you know what I mean it's like not the best way of doing it you know I've had experience and you know sort of know different people and like with that like I know what to expect right like I know that hey we haven't done a good job like up front we have you know a bunch of reasons for why we do it that way um and then you know maybe third or fourth like I've seen MMG in action right like again with that PR example like there are one or two PR firms that I actually recommend to startups because I've seen them work with companies of mine it's like yeah they'll charge ten thousand dollars or seven thousand dollars a month uh but I've seen them you know with a good company and with a good pitch get great write-ups and do good work so it's like they've got that social proof and then you know with the MMG it's like all right now they're putting where the deal we structured they have a lot of upside but they're putting their money where their mouth is they're not taking anything up front so I think like I would kind of look at it like combining two three four five six things anytime you're looking to bring someone on as a partner like it can't just be one thing that sounds good it sort of has to be like wow there's a multitude of factors that all lead me to saying yes and then I think the other thing too is like my business is quite different than you know like a bootstrapping I would call my business bootstrap I've never raised money or anything like that um you know a bootstrap pipe type of business I think like giving up Equity is a lot different than you know I think I'm sure taking on like a 50 50 partnership as like a VC funded startup is like crazy but in bootstrap world you know it's like completely different I think uh you know different situations so I think that's the other sort of caveat the advice I gave to this entrepreneur was create a timeline of all the interactions that you've had with this potential partner just like get a piece of paper write down all the interactions that you've had okay how many years has it been one two five ten okay uh how did they make you feel when they did this did they under promise and over deliver did they say they were gonna do this thing and it didn't happen and just all the things that you can possibly remember just like write it on a timeline and most importantly write the outcome of how you feel you felt in that moment yeah oh you know what because if you're getting into business with someone like you want to have fun and you want to smile and you want to have a good time too so you want to you know you wanna basically uh have records of how you're feeling about all these situations and I asked this guy now and he to come back with me with this timeline and he texted me actually today and he said like you know what there's been a few interactions with this person that have been pretty negative yeah and but they are the best they are the best and insert social proof here Institute and I was just like it's not worth it it's not it's not worth partnering with someone where you're going to have you know 10 20 negative uh relation you know outcomes um because you know it's very hard to undo these relationships yeah yeah I I like that framework and I think that you know I haven't thought about it too much so this is kind of fun that you're asking me about this but I imagine that like if everything isn't aligned like I I feel like most often in business Partnerships things like diverge then get better you know what I mean like you almost have to be like 1 000 on the same page because you're gonna it's gonna be tough you're gonna have some ups and downs and you know I feel like more often you know people's personal lives or situations change and that adds you know a wrench like oh I can't spend as much time because I have a kid now or I moved or whatever right so it's like it can only add more to the mix so if you're not like super aligned I mean even one thing I considered in working with Grant and MMG it'll be funny if he listens to this interview is like I liked him as a person uh and like I always prefer like I would much rather work with people that I like hanging out with and I know this sounds a little bit weird but like it's really hard for me to be friends with people that I work with if they're not good at their job like if they don't excel at their job like I can't shoot the on the phone with them like hey how was your week I'm like no let's not talk about your weekend like why isn't this done what what's going on you know like my first priority is business and working together and if we can crush it on that then like let's go have some fun together let's hang out let's talk you know let's vacation together whatever it might be and you know I hired my uh coo three four years ago and he uh you know we actually met at a fincon which is a personal finance bloggers conference and he was working for a top travel site kind of managing that and you know we like kind of instantly you know we hung out the whole weekend and we connected we had a lot of fun and I ended up bringing him on uh to the business uh for a few years and one of the things I enjoyed most about working with him was he was great at his job but also just I liked hanging out with him and you know he was like one of the you know kind of few people that I've hired over the years who like excelled at his job and also that I liked on a personal level and enjoyed talking to him and you know I went to Miami and um for a conference and you know he lives in West Palm Beach and I had him come down for a night we just like hung out and you know he talked about some business but we really just like hung out as friends for a weekend you know and like honestly like very little business purpose but you know it was like kind of fun last question because I gotta run all right if you if you were to summarize a decade of your knowledge and building content based Niche businesses what comes top of mind what is what is the most powerful advice you can give to people who are interested in becoming the future Rideshare guy of their own spaces yeah I mean I think it's kind of summary of some of the threads I've mentioned is you know pick something that you're interested in pick something that has some or a lot of business opportunity and you know I think it feels good to help people so you know if you're you know can find something that's you know more helpful to you know drivers making 15 to 20 an hour I think you'll get more personal satisfaction out of that than helping you know hedge fund guys uh so you know if you can kind of gravitate towards that and then on the actual sort of tactical side I think content and working online I am such a huge proponent of it because the amount of work that goes into one piece of content and the potential reach is infinite right I mean you can literally put out a blog post or a video that reaches five people ten people 100 people or 100 million people and obviously the higher you go up in that stack you know it's a little bit it's a lot tougher to reach 100 million than five or ten people but I mean our most popular video on YouTube has 5 million views and it's all about truck driving super random but you know it's like you can kind of do that I love the kind of short form platforms right now or investing a lot in short form content uh Tick Tock YouTube shorts Instagram reels because discoverability is so high you know you put something out there and it can go viral a lot um easier I would almost say it's impossible not impossible but it's very difficult for a blog post you know on a brand new site to go viral relative to a lot of the short form video platforms are out there since they're more you know kind of algorithmic Discovery based now so I think kind of leaning into video and you know really just kind of creating consistent content for a long period of time like be a cockroach never die that's why I say if you pick a topic that you love and you just like doing you know one podcast a week for 10 years like good opportunity I guarantee you know if you do one podcast a week for 10 years good opportunities are going to come your way and that might be more of the extreme but you know I always say like one year you know one year when it comes to content and try to be consistent for one year don't even worry about monetizing for the first year if something Falls in your lap great but you know I like that kind of one year threshold be a cockroach yeah be a cockroach that's a good one all right where could people find you uh on the internet and thank you for letting us crawl inside your brain yeah no that was fun I think you asked some uh good uh challenging and new questions and I haven't done uh an interview like this in quite a while so it was fun uh I would say if they're interested in anything Rideshare gig economy just type it into a box on the internet and we should pop up and if not let me know if there's some box that we're not popping up on I'll take that as a personal challenge but we've got therideshareguy.com our YouTube channel uh the Rideshare guy is growing pretty quickly I kind of share my uh personal you know sort of thoughts on the Rideshare and gig economy Industries on my weekly podcast the Rideshare guy and then on the content side sort of the uh I'm probably most active on Twitter at the Rideshare guy and then I've got my new podcast that's more focused on investor investing in startups and things like that called one of the angels and we're doing a weekly uh live show there that's it's a new show but getting a lot of traction and been a lot of fun so far there you have it the Rideshare guys awesome thank you thank you

Description:
Saying yes to one thing, almost always means saying no to something else.

When we created Dash, here was just no path to sustainability and success.

So we pulled the plug.

We could have pivoted the project instead of ending it.

But this would have meant saying no to other opportunities that had arisen.

Title: What is AdSense? With Austin Lieberman
Published: 2023-05-23 14:00:17 UTC
Description:
If you want to grow your YouTube channel, AdSense can be a valuable metric.

AdSense is a reflection of the amount of viewers that you get on your videos, the amount of time that they're engaged with your videos, and the ‘quality’ of your viewers.

If that number's going up it means that you are getting a wider reach in a higher quality audience.

That's going to be ideal for your brands and partnerships.

AdSense is a reflection of a couple things right the amount of viewers that you get on your videos the amount of time that they're engaged with your videos it's also based on the quality of the viewer and it sounds horrible to say this I'm not labeling people here I'm labeling people in terms of how valuable advertisers view them and so that comes down to what country are they viewing from what's their age group whether we're talking about revenue or we're talking about views or view duration or the geography or demographics of the audience I still think it's a valuable metric because if that number is going up it means that you are getting a wider reach and a higher quality audience that's going to be ideal for your brands or other people that you partner with

Description:
Don’t take advice from toxic people.

Rising above negativity and embracing self-worth requires a huge mindset shift.

Hate often originates from deep-seated insecurities.

Fulfilled people have no interest in tearing others down.

So, if you do have people tearing you down, know that it’s nothing to do with you.

They see your success as a threat.

Title: Stop Trying To Sell More Than One Product, Explains Nik Sharma
Published: 2023-05-20 14:00:37 UTC
Description:
Something many companies get wrong is selling way too many different products.

Instead, focus on having just one amazing product that you are well known for.

Most of the time you’ll find that companies have one or two lines that produce 80% of profits.

Get rid of the products that aren’t in your top 20% and you could save a ton on the bottom line.

some of these brands that exist they sell way too many things they don't focus on something they're not known for one thing so if I was running The Honest Company I would figure out what products to cut honest companies known for good honest ingredients but do they really need to have a beauty line and wipes cleaning products bath and body and baby products probably not I would imagine that two of these categories do really well for them and the other six they just exist

[Music] [Music] dude I'm I am really excited for this chat likewise man I feel like it's been a long time coming I almost almost wish I was sort of like interviewing you on the Pod because you're doing such like crazy stuff man so I'm really excited to chat today I mean let's just let's just chat and see where it goes um why I'm excited to chat with you is I've seen you grow to millions of followers over the last couple years you know through your metaverse account and now through your AI accounts and I just want to talk shop I want to crawl around your brain and extract all that good stuff in there and and I appreciate you taking some time of course man no I'd love to you know start by chatting about content it's just been such a big passion of mine for so long you mentioned metaverse and now Luna I've actually been building um you know let's call them faceless media Brands right for a long long time now a better part of a decade and I've built and then sold now a lot to a lot of communities specifically on Instagram because that's just where I've sort of like almost like um I probably spent my most time you know on the internet on Instagram so I built a ton of communities you know totaling probably over 10 million followers but I think what's been really interesting is in January I started putting out content consistently for myself which is something that I've never and it's because I think this is where sort of the world is going especially the media landscape is going my inbound for my personal content has been 100x even even metaverse to the Bull Run 100x what that inbound look like and so I've really started to notice it's like you know people buy from people people want their information filtered through people not these faceless media brands or media Giants and so I think I think it's sort of like a small microcosm of where the entire media landscape is going so that's been a lot of fun to see so if you were to redo it all would you have started your personal brand earlier hundred percent I think um now granted there is there is a lot of benefit to having like these media Brands as like sort of support or content that doesn't necessarily fit my personal brand or content that I think may cause diminishing returns it's great to have those media Brands to kind of like you know use those um but yeah man I I wish I started a lot a lot earlier right because I've always been sort of posting content to the internet sporadically um but I've never done so consistently and deliberately like now I'm I'm creating content and there's a deliberate Mission behind it right I want to capture all the attention I can at the top funnel it down to my own products um whereas before it was just sort of you know off the cuff like I'd post a picture here I'd go on a vacation or post a cool picture here but it was really nothing but kind of like vanity right like this is my life this is what I'm doing look how cool this picture I just posted was where now there's a deliberate strategy behind it I have this new thesis it took a work in progress thesis yeah curious your thoughts that every brand will have an ALT account so I came to this conclusion um do you know Nathan lands yeah man yeah so talk to him all the time on Twitter great guy yeah great guy you know tweets about generative AI a bunch and I saw him just continuously tweeting about this Boris account have you seen that yeah oh is that his account yeah so yeah so basically he was like yeah he was he basically kept tweeting like don't follow don't follow Boris or I stole this here okay yeah his last tweet it's been less than 72 hours since mid-journey 5.1 bomb drop check out my five check out my 10 favorite examples how are these not real photos P.S I stole this from Boris whatever you do don't follow him or at Nathan lands so I clicked on Boris and it's like the profile picture is hilarious it's this guy with like super long hair it's like this cartoon weird looking guy and he he went from zero to nineteen thousand followers in a couple of weeks and if you go to his account it's like way more edgy so like it's way more edgy memes it's like not really Nathan so it got a little more off-brand for Nathan exactly so it's kind of what do you think of this idea that you know maybe every brand has their brand account personal accounts for the leadership team and then an ALT account which is way more edgy I think two thoughts come to mind one um it that's fascinating because I thought Boris was just a real person right and it sort of like adds to this new notion of the internet where like is there even a real person behind the brand is it AI generated AI assisted is it you know somebody completely different uh and so that I would have never known if you didn't tell me right and so I think that's pretty fascinating now follow Boris I I laugh at the memes I like um you know I I consume the information as if if it were a real person right so so like the first thing that comes to mind is like wow you know generative AI maybe or AI assisted sort of like bot accounts could sort of pass as a real person that's insane but two I love the idea I mean I think it's sort of what I have kind of been doing right like so sometimes there is something that I'd love to post but I feel it's a little bit off-brand sometimes it's a little bit gimmicky you know like here are 10 apps that you can use to harness the power of generative AI to you know boost your business or whatever and I'm like I don't know if I want to post that little gimmicky but I got metaverse or luna that I could do that on right and so there's no like there's no brand Equity hit if that makes sense for like the personal brand and so now that you say it yeah I actually think you're onto something I think that's a brilliant idea right because you have two separate Brands two separate uh tones voices communication Styles and then uh you know depending on the content that you want to push it's like you can see which one is better suited for that I love it yeah and it's a it's just another creative Outlet like there's some things where you start writing the tweet and you're like uh do I really want to press publish on this right like you know it's gonna maybe ruffle some feathers maybe it's a bit too edgy um too cringe um so what you're saying is kind of like for the two cringe put posted on your on your brand account and for the two edgy posted on the alt account yeah I mean honestly it's kind of like a finsta with economic ambition right it's like offensive but that's public that you could use to Drive Commerce I think I honestly that you you may have just spotted like a really fast emerging Trend so kudos to Nathan um I love that I'm gonna give that a lot of thought over the coming weeks you've got these you've got a Luna you've got metaverse tell people what they are and what type of content you post and why like why even be focusing your time on that what I've really been doing with some of these media Brands is I is I build up these communities in these audiences and then there's usually a product to push underneath that with metaverse has not been so much that it's really just been like this educational sort of endeavor for me right like I love uh to educate people on emerging Tech paradigms and new things happening in the space because I'm like I'm a nerd man I'm geeking out about this stuff all day like on Twitter like chatting with like-minded people and I just love to be able to present this to a more mainstream audience like sort of what's happening what's going on and so like I lead really through Education First in my style um Aluna was always a it's a sass it's a SAS startup right because I'm looking around uh generative AI landscape and I'm like man this is incredible um but it feels pretty disjointed right especially stable diffusion um I'm a big believer that open source will prevail and that'll be sort of like the winning uh foundational layer that AI is going to be built on top of because you know I don't want to go in a tangent but even you know Chad gbt I feel like every update gets neutered a little more and more and more and more so like as a builder I I feel a little bit I don't know if I'd want to build on chat GPT right they have too much leverage there's too much platform risk so I'm looking at open source Alternatives and I see stable diffusion there's incredible stuff being built on top of stable diffusion but it's hard for anybody to interface with right you got to be able to run it locally in your PC so you need technical abilities you need to understand how to you know operate a node or set up a Dev environment I'm like who's going to go through this and do it um even mid-journey I think is one of the most spectacular products I've ever seen in my life but like why is it Discord only right and so I think it just um I think we just signed up opportunity with the Luna to build the SAS product to bring in like 20 generative AI products eventually there'll be like this this llm that will train uh so you'll be able to interface with all these products with voice so as a content creator like Greg you might say um hey I need an image of this I want uh you know pop or trap music like a trap beat I need that on top of it I want big bold text that says this and so hopefully like in a year from now we'll have this llm that'll be able to you know anything a content creator may need you just do it through voice so I started to interrupt you so when you came up with the idea for a Luna were you like I want to create this SAS product and this is the vision or were you like um I'm not sure what I want to build here I'm just gonna aggregate a bunch of people and figure it out from there so that's part of it so I knew I wanted to create a product right and for Content creators specifically and so that's when I sort of reverse engineered it and like something that I've just been doing over the last five to ten years is like I build these online communities through education through information through like really great visual content that really resonates with audiences and then I put like a product underneath and with the Luna That's it man it's like we're trying to figure out now like I think we've sort of achieved product Market fit you know we have 30 000 users now there's been 800 purchase purchases on the site um I think 200 subscribers so I'm like okay we're something here but now it's about trying to figure out that moat and trying to figure out what to build next right and so what we've done is like we've just put four really dope Builders Under One Roof me um and my co-founders Greg who's a front-end developer suha back-end wizard uh and then fa who's our mobile developer and um you know now we're just tinkering and we're playing around and we're seeing what's possible and we're just building building building shipping as fast as possible and like the idea is that we'll we'll uh we'll hit a home run on one of these products right and then put all of our resources behind that product and so it's just like it is this exercise and tinkering and it's been a lot of fun man and and uh you know people really love the site so far so yeah you know people often ask me they're like what should my minimal viable product be which in my MVP be yeah and I always say that 95 of MVPs could be a WhatsApp group yeah 100 like or an Instagram or Tick Tock or a Twitter account you know it's a free account that you can just start inviting people and start with your friends right um what advice could you give to people around maybe they're interested in a niche and they want to start an account it's pretty daunting for a lot of people what advice could you give to people around starting so so that's the what you just said starting start is always my primary piece of advice and as like Elementary and obvious that it sounds it's actually not that like it's very very difficult for people to grasp right and there's two two things that I think hold everybody back and these are the two mental hurdles that I think if you're able to uh jump over if you're able to LEAP then you kind of become invincible right to me and one is the ability to really truly not care what people think right and and I used to really care a lot I was like man what's my boy gonna think what's this person going to think what's this random person on the internet gonna think if I try this it doesn't work out if it fails and something that kind of like freed me was this idea that nobody's thinking about me man like I finally realized it like nobody's thinking about us nobody's thinking about anybody else everybody's really just kind of consumed and focused on their own self right then the other thing that helped me out was I realized like all toxicity and negativity on the internet like I started to really understand insecurity from an intimate level and I think all behavior on the internet stems down to fear like a healthy fear but but insecurity is like uh you know any toxicity on the internet kind of stems from there and so that allowed me I'm like free now I'll post whatever I want whenever I want I don't I don't care right and then the other thing is this idea that you're never ready and you never will be ready you know and a lot of people oh man I see it every day oh I need to get into a little bit better shape before I start making content I need to I need to make a little bit more money so people can take me more seriously um I need better equipment like all of these anytime I hear this I'm like this person is not going to break out anytime soon because they got to get over this this mental hurdle and so that's it man really understanding that nobody's thinking about you um and if they are spewing toxicity that's a reflection on them and not you and two you're never ready you might as well start today you know so that's kind of my two pieces of advice as simple and basic as they are I was I was actually reminded of that over the last 45 days because I decided that I wanted to grow my Instagram account yeah and my Instagram account had like I don't know 1500 people following me mostly like high school friends yeah um so I basically try to get my you know I've got 330 000 followers on Twitter I was like follow me on Instagram turns out like very hard to get people from twit you know one platform to another platform yes so I was like okay I guess I'm just gonna try to build this on my own and I was first I was posting like everyday videos you know thoughts on my Instagram and I kept noticing that like you know two three four people were sharing it and I had a feeling that people were sharing it and they were kind of making fun of me basically um like who's this guy like post you know every day I was posting getting like three likes um you know and I had to stop myself I had to be like doesn't matter and you kind of just have to push through um now I'm I'm sitting at like 6 500 followers and I'm like I could just start I'm starting to feel the momentum just wait till the end of the year where you're gonna be you know yeah exactly so it's yeah I totally agree with that advice I think it's it's easy advice to give it's hard advice to take yeah because you have to wake up every single day and look at your you know Instagram account and see two likes or you know guess how guess what the immediate what is it the at gets the average amount of likes on a tweet probably one if you I mean zero that's insane yeah yeah I mean it makes sense right it makes sense like in our world we probably don't we probably don't notice that right just because we're following people who have already like sort of accomplished and stuff but yeah I mean you imagine you know Facebook has Facebook has I think now 80 percent of people with an active internet connection who are daily active users of one of their products you know so that's three billion people so you can imagine probably 2.9 billion of those if not more are averaging you know one or two likes on whatever piece of content they do but man that's that your proof of that idea that you had you just have to start you know even as uncomfortable as it is in the beginning and that's another thing I tell people I'm like you're gonna start creating content you're gonna probably gonna suck at it two probably nobody's gonna care for a long long time but that is the point like that is part of the process you got to go through that and that allows you to find your voice develop a visual style communication style learn to see what works what doesn't what resonates with an audience and so I'm like serious it's that simple you just have to start and then have patience like I saw Mr Beast tweeted the other day like the uh the the total number of views that he's had in every year he's been acting on YouTube and the first year I think he had 14 000 views total right not a huge number over the course of a year and then the second year he had seven thousand views so it got cut in half he went even harder most people at that point would have been so discouraged and they would have been you know starting to self-doubt themselves and they would have quit they would have stopped making content and so like that that was a perfect example of what will happen when you start making content it'll take time to break through and that's just that is just part of the game you know unless you get really really lucky or ride like some crazy momentum Wave It's just gonna take time and that's supposed to be that way yeah you gotta get out of your head and get into two percent get into other people's heads meaning what is the what is the Tweet what is the the picture what is the video that is really gonna resonate with the people that you actually care about I also think I also think that there's a bunch of accounts right now that have millions of followers that are just very low quality accounts totally oh man yeah we could talk about that forever quality versus quantity right yeah and first of all I want to go back to what you were saying like even if that were true even if somebody was sharing one of your piece of content your friend like in a negative fashion like how bad of a look is it for that person who took time out of it so that's another thing I've realized like there's no fulfilled human on planet Earth that would even take 10 seconds out of their day to tear somebody else down right so that's another thing that's really helped me it's like who cares like would you take advice from those people probably not so why would you you know why would you take the toxicity to heart um so that was kind of like these are the mental models that I've been framing for myself over the over the years to the point where now I like truly I can truly say I just don't care right yeah um well the booze come from the cheapest seats hate never comes from above never about you know yeah 100 man um and then to what you were saying uh my bad what was the follow-up question on that lots of training thought um there's a bunch of accounts that you and I follow that are low quality to me like the the sort of the um the best indicator of a quality audience is how much Commerce you're able to push right because ultimately you know people don't like to admit it but like social media really is kind of a status game and at the bottom of it like the underpinning of social is sort of you know the ability to Drive Commerce you know for yourself or others and that that is kind of like the game that that we're all playing I think there is an economic ambition um behind this all um and when I see I mean there are some influencers out there with five six million followers that if they try to sell a t-shirt they might get two sales right there's no there's no relationship there with that audience so there is a huge distinction between a follower and or followers and a community right and I see this all the time and I see people hey I have a hundred thousand people on my mailing list and then you look a little closer their open rates like 1.2 percent so it's like what does that really matter right would you rather or there's people with 3 000 people in the mailing list with a 70 open rate you know and so I see this all the time and usually what happens is you know people develop uh this following through cheap tactics right so through like algorithm hacks um you know through giveaway Loops whatever it may be it's actually it's actually if you want to get a two million uh follower Instagram account you just do cheap tactics and it's easy but what end up happening is your engagement will be like dismal you only have two million followers on an Instagram account you might get like 300 likes per po like eventually um eventually you kind of expose yourself right and so like my my mantras always just build slow build right quality over quantity at all times and I think marketers around the world are finally smartening up whereas five years ago it was just like this person has a lot of followers giving money right and so that's what kind of like helped perpetuate the sort of phenomenon of low quality uh uh followings on some of these large accounts but people are smartening up now man so I think I think that all evens out Market plays itself out you say uh grow slow um but at the same time you're growing really quick yeah you've probably added 400 000 followers across your Platforms in 30 days how are you doing it and how are you dealing with it yeah I mean I think so uh first of all it's like people saying oh you you blew up like and I'm like yeah oh maybe overnight success 10 years in the making you know this has been nine years of trying everything as you know just like constantly being you know creating content um yeah I think for my personal I've gone maybe 400 000 across all uh all my personal socials in the last hundred days and then again like the Luna in the last hundred days uh you know 230k followers I think metaverse Saturday another hundred thousand or so over the last hundred days all of this like people ask for the secret the secret is just good content right it's just good content and that's and that's kind of it and consistency and quality you know people ask for like the cheat code what's the cheat code what's the secret recipe I'm like there is none you just put in the work over a long enough period of time you'll eventually have your breakthroughs and figure out um and so just instinctively and like sort of like innate to me now I just understand how to resonate with an audience what people are looking for um so I've been able to crack a lot of these platforms but the last sort of final frontier for me is YouTube which I think is the is the most important one so this year I'm like gonna focus on on trying to crack that one because that's the one that's been eluding me for for a long time first of all on the YouTube bit I I just recorded an episode um check it out um where we we go through how to grow on YouTube um I'll definitely be watching that Austin Lieberman and the biggest takeaway I had from the Austin Lieberman chat was that the people like I thought the people that was watching the where it happens YouTube show were subscribers of the where it happens YouTube show and I was completely wrong it's you know a lot of people just seeing it on YouTube recommendations it's people seeing shorts It's people um you know just seeing it across YouTube so it's really about you know one way to think about YouTube is how do you reverse engineer um the search search terms basically if people are searching for XYZ how do you go and then create a video about it and then rank for it so definitely check that out and then um I heard through the grapevine that you manage the Aluna Instagram account so I I chat I chatted with someone on your team who was like you know doing some freelance work and he was like hey I like you know I work on the Aluna Twitter account and I was like you don't work on the Instagram account that's like the bread and butter and he's like no no that's that's Roberto's thing yeah it's it's been really really tough for me to find people who understand how to create good visual content so that's my question can you Outsource great visual content quick Interruption from me if you're listening to this on Apple podcast or Spotify you're getting any value you need to come to YouTube and subscribe to the where it happens podcast YouTube channel I promise you the experience is richer more interesting so if you're getting any value just stop what you're doing open up the YouTube app go to the website and press subscribe at where it happens on YouTube and if you're watching this on YouTube and you haven't subscribed what are you doing go go press subscribe thank you enjoy the rest of the show this is so tough right because it it looks easy to do right it's much harder to do well than than people may think and so I've had trouble finding people that do it well on a consistent basis and then two what I've noticed is here's another phenomenon that I think is like and and you talk about this a lot which I love like the solo preneur kind of like uh emergence right but here's the thing Greg like if I find somebody who's a killer who knows how to do it super super well why would they come work for me they're just going to do it on their own for their own you know their own uh faces media brands or their own products or their own whatever it is and that that's kind of the thing with um that I've been seeing with you know a lot of these like big accounts that hire people to create content for them and even this is a phenomenon that's happening in big media right now right eventually the people that are creating the content they're so good that why would they work on behalf of somebody else right and so a lot of these a lot of these um companies sort of agencies I look at them as incubators now right so maybe I can incubate great talent but eventually I'm going to want them to go off on their own and do it because that that's sort of the that's sort of the difficulty here man it's like if you find somebody really really good they probably won't want to work for you anyways right and so that I've had a I've had difficulty finding people um to to be able to create really good visual content and um but at the same time I really love it too like I I really do enjoy it so it's hard for me to kind of like relinquish control as silly as it may sound in a world where you know you really need to be delegating uh to maximize output have you ever considered acquiring other media Brands and employing kind of like uh doing things media approach um for those of you who don't know doing things they they run 35 Plus accounts they've got more than 80 million followers some of their accounts are like middle class fancy or uh yeah yeah overheard so it's these meme accounts and the beauty about it is you know once you have this network of accounts then like coming up with a new account is so much easier because you can essentially pump the new account with your existing Network totally absolutely man it compounds very beautifully exactly so have you ever thought about acquiring uh essentially acquiring accounts but it's really acquiring Talent yes and no I mean one one person I was doing that really well is my friend kit he runs the puberty Media Group you might have seen puberty on Instagram I mean like I think he has 100 million followers across his family of accounts now so he's done that really really well I think for me like honestly Greg like I I like media I like creating content but I don't necessarily like the media business I really love Building Product right like that's what I've been doing over the last 10 years and so that that's kind of really what I want to focus on and I just look at these sort of media brands that I'm building as a way to drive traffic uh and to bring awareness and attention to those products so it's not necessarily something that I haven't considered it's just not you know something that's super interesting for me and for me it's always been like it's been a little bit less about the money and more about the freedom to do whatever I find interesting to do so it's a great idea just not something that I want to put a lot of time and energy into right now if that makes sense it does it does Let's uh let's actually transition from the media side of things to the product building side yeah talk talkaluna so okay so you launch Aluna um it's helped a little bit by the metaverse account I would imagine in terms of growing it uh so it was so funny enough uh it's really been so metaverse even stagnated for like four months it's actually been my personal content and I'll collab post uh with the Luna and metaverse that has grown these accounts again right that have seen this emerging so metaverse is now stagnated for a long time and it's now up I think like nearing a hundred thousand followers over the course of the since I started making my content and I've noticed that these platforms are actually prioritizing original content creation and they like longer videos now even Tick Tock they're encouraging promoting a minute long minute plus long videos and so what I would recommend anybody trying to build these accounts is like Leverage yourself or somebody else as a personal Creator because that really helps to build these these other accounts so you start so you leverage your account started building a Luna the account you're getting a lot of traction and starting to feel good when do you know it's ready to actually go and build the product and how did you know which product to build um so I actually had the product in mind first so we knew we were going to build a product and I think the first actually commit to the repo was around 10 weeks ago so it's like we've just been really uh rapidly and then the Instagram account was in January so about 12 weeks ago I want to say right and so I knew I wanted to build a product that started with the IG account first just to drive that attention um to gather the team and the resources needed to build this product but it was really a product comes first and then it's like building an account to suit that product if that makes sense my my hunch is you knew you wanted to build something with AI and content creators yeah so you knew that and then you're like okay how do I like reverse engineer that to build an account around it once the account started to grow and you saw a validation then you're like okay let's hit the pavement put the team together did you raise funding or you just self-funded it not yet so right now we're totally bootstrapped there's been a lot of venture interest but I was like let let's hit this product Market fit first let's get some real real momentum and understand like okay we're going to be able to be profitable very very quickly and then we'll be comfortable sort of raising funds um it'll probably go for a pre-seed fund uh very soon however though because I've I understood really quick like to be able to compete with some of these bmrs we need a real distribution um strategy you know we we need a lot of a lot of money for there and also the hardware stack like right now we're running on our own gpus and we have a product launching today called motion blend that I think is going to go crazy viral I have a ton of content creators lined up to to release a video around this motion blend product I think we'll you know reach a million eyeballs in a day but we actually can't unleash that we don't have the hardware stack right now to be able to you know like if that 100 000 people visit the site in a day there's not going to be a lot of generations happening because all the gpus are going to be filled up right so now we're like okay no we do need to raise Capital just for the hardware stack and the distribution um because there is for some reason there's no good GPU cloud service out there right now so if anybody wants to build that that's a great business to get into walk us through like what are the coolest product features about a Luna and how are people using it today Yeah man so the coolest product features I don't think are out yet right so the motion blend is one of these new ones it's actually built on a tool called deforum unstable diffusion I don't know if you've heard of that but it's um you know you're able to input several prompts you know one two three five however many prompts you want and then the AI Blends right like the diffusion uh fills in like this blend um animation between all these prompts and so again like I'm looking at the Forum and I'm like this is the coolest thing in the world you can create your own music videos like imagination is Limitless here but like to interface with it you have to be technically Savvy there's no there's no interface right now that exists online for the average person to go in and create so we've built that we've tweaked it we've added our own animations and and whatnot and that's launching uh later today that I think is going to be one of our killer Flagship products that we can evolve over time and our text to image I love it we we have different models that we've tweaked and refined over time and I think the output is almost as good as mid-journey but mid journey is the King right in text to image and so that's why we're excited to release some of these upcoming tools we have 10 in the pipeline that'll come out over the next six weeks um and which I think will be our sort of Flagship product and the cool thing about building a Luna Greg is that um right now we're just tinkering we're just exploring and it's and it's working and people are loving it I do think we'll we'll hit that home run soon with that killer product um one of these next eight products that we'll ship I think will be that home run that we then you know go laser focused into yeah I also think it's it's similar to Social in the sense that it's okay not to hit a home run at the first at bat yeah totally totally You're Building Goodwill with the community and they're seeing that you're trying and they're seeing that you're making progress and you're doing it your own way and as long as you're doing that like and you have Runway um all good well I also think that one of the key elements to a Luna too that that we set out to build is there's this social layer on top of right and we're releasing the ability to follow and be followed this week but we've kind of built like Instagram for generative Ai and I think that's important because we all know in generative AI the output is is dependent on the quality of the input right and so these chat boxes if you know how to work them amazing right but the average person will go to chat GPT and not understand how to harness his true potential or power so what they'll do is they'll go you know search Google or whatever for prompts but I believe if there's a visual feed there you can actually follow your favorite creators see what they're creating get inspiration from their prompts how they're creating how they're using their tools I think that gives us a real Advantage especially when we get into audio video and all these other products that we're building so you have this gorgeous visual feed of other creators you can draw inspiration from to really kind of get that best output for yourself for your brand or business and so I'm really excited about the social component that we're building on top of Luna do you think in five years from now people are still going to be prompting or will that be a thing of the past I actually I'm not as bullish on the idea of a prompt engineer as most right I think it'll be it'll be like knowing how to use Google or Excel it's just like a a particular skill that'll be helpful um but no I think the pro I mean like one of our main Ambitions too is to build a product where you don't need to know how to prompt engineer like we'll we'll be able to sort of walk you through there and I think a lot of products are going to head in that direction where it's kind of yeah I I think it'll be phased out relatively quickly and how do you deal with competition you know you're you're in such a competitive space yeah um every entrepreneur knows the feeling of waking up and seeing a competitor come out and then your your you know your stomach you know just tightens um it just hurts and of course I'm sure you must feel that all the time how do you deal with that yeah I mean like what I think the most fierce competition are going to be the um the incumbents you know like a lot of this technology is going to be built into the products that we know and love and use today right So eventually like um you know even even mid-journey I think they're going to face trouble because it's eventually going to be integrated into Photoshop in a Premiere into DaVinci Resolve into word into every product that we already know and love and use so um one thing that we kind of the the way that we sort of navigate this and one of our mantras it's like look we have this now customer base that's pretty passionate you know they love the product they want to see it succeed let's just cater to their needs let's not worry so much about the competitors right and so it's kind of this approach that I learned from just consuming a lot of Jeff Bezos just just hyper hyper focus on your users on your customers don't worry so much about what the competition is doing and don't like your decision making shouldn't be dependent on your competition it should be dependent on bringing the most value to your customers and so we're just focused there and focusing on our advantages which is the ability to ship at lightning speeds you know like you name a product we could build it in four days and high quality so the older I get and the longer I'm an entrepreneur the more I realize that ignorance is bliss when it comes to competition yeah 100 like when it comes to a lot of things right yeah it's true and I think it's just you know I used to be when I was in my early 20s I would obsess about the competition yep and I would be like oh my God they have the same copy as us or the images look the same or our background is white and their background is white and then I realized the people that win in the game of Entrepreneurship have a long-term mindset yeah 100 and to your point like they're kind of like okay I'm I'm focused on content creators and I'm gonna basically if content creators is you know the middle the spoke and attire um or the middle of the tire the spokes um are just the different products that you're trying to trying to launch and if you just like focus in the middle of the tire things are going to work out one of those are gonna hit um but if you spend all day obsessing on you know if you're on product hunt all day or you're on Twitter all day just looking at different competition uh it's nice to know and it's also helpful honestly for motivation keeps you on your toes yeah sure I love that analogy though focus on the spokes focus on the spokes yeah yeah um I'm sure you use AI in your workflow uh what are some tools that you've been using that you find very very uh powerful yeah so first part of that question is like it's funny because we're sort of reversing engineer to to solve our own uh pain points right so me I want to build a product that I would be integrating into my daily workflows to maximize my output so one of the things was you know text to image I'm using that almost for every Luna cover I'm generating my own image with uh with a Luna first to draw attention to the platform for once but also too because before I use stock images unsplash pixels but like these same images are being used a million other places and so it offers a chance to to really kind of like generate your own unique imagery um I can also like one of the things that's amazing is I have a chat GPT browser tab open at all times now and I'm always interfacing with that when it comes to creating content um menial things like rewriting captions you know written a little bit better sometimes when I'm summarizing synthesizing an article or trying to present that information I'll ask it to summarize that article summarize a YouTube video so it's increased my productivity I would say probably like two or three x just on that front alone and I also it also just amazes me how fast things can change man like you know five months ago we didn't have this product now I can't I don't have a tab open you know it's like always open on one of my tabs and I'm using it daily but for for me it's been mostly uh on on the copywriting stuff right it saved me a lot of time on copywriting because that's one thing that people don't realize when you're creating a lot of content is the captions um the stories Etc so that's cut my time in half but other other than that like there's not a lot of products out there that I think have that's another thing with generative AI we can get to that conversation if you want but like I think there's going to be a lot of churn a lot of these products because it's really cool it's fascinating uh technology but some of them are not just so helpful in the day-to-day right like 11 Labs best voice synthesizer on the planet I'm using it maybe once a month you know and that'll probably get like less and less and less there's just not that many use cases for it for your average content creator unless you're automating content on YouTube then it's you know godsend those people are probably using it every day but I think we'll see this with a lot of generative AI as well where it's not like it's helpful but for certain specific use cases not for day-to-day use yeah I think what's going to end up happening is there's going to be these AI Suites for different communities so there'll be the AI suite for Content creators the AI suite for marketers the I suite for insert and it needs to be something that you're going to use every single day if you're going to actually like pay for it and and adopt it into your workflow I think what we're seeing right now in the stage we're in is there's a lot of people tinkering with single purpose AI apps and we're starting to see a lot of magic out of them but I think in 12 to 18 months what we'll see is some of these sweets come up of course some of them will be from incumbents like the adobe's already starting that Microsoft of course is already starting that Microsoft designer Etc um but there's also going to be a whole new wave of alunas and and a Luna for X right for 100 yeah that that's so that's actually something that one of my uh sort of a mentor told me he's like hey you got to focus on the specific subset because at the beginning it was just like this is a tool for all all people with you know business professionals creatives and he's like that's too wide you're trying to build too much for too many people um Niche it down and so now like the focus is going to be for Content creators and I completely agree with you like eventually there will be uh one for real estate agents in specific all tools just uh you know kind of like built on behalf of of that community and I I think you nailed it man I really think you nailed it that's something that I've been thinking about it's like there will be a suite for everything as specific as you can imagine you know um and so we're we're kind of focusing on the uh content creation with the hyper competitive landscape that we're we're facing but you know eventually we can maybe um what we want to build is eventually an API so people could build on top of it and you know have a Luna um you know sort of refined for the specific community that they they're trying to Target so I think that's well said and I agree I want to end with this question just because it's uh optimistic or pessimistic question depending on your view on AI but what does the world of AI look like in five years from now so I kind of when it comes to Tech I'm sort of like an eternal optimist and the reason why is like what is sort of the point of focusing on the negative if it's inevitable right it's just sort of like wasted energy the bet the better exercise I think is how can we best harness it how can we best be involved in the conversation to push it Forward ethically responsibly Etc um what I think is going to happen and I made a video about it today actually I just posted it but like you are going to be able to generate anything that you want enter any entertainment medium that you want curated to your taste so like yeah maybe maybe Greg you come home and you say man I want to play a video game I'm a big RPG nerd there hasn't been a good RPG in a while I'm just going to generate my own tonight and play it right or maybe there's a specific software that you need for a specific purpose instead of browsing the App Store and trying to find it you just generated hey I need an app that can get me you know do this so like almost any tool any any platform any entertainment medium that you want to consume you're going to be able to do it you're going to be able to generate it but one thing that I'm also thinking with AI like obviously by the end of the year we're going to have fully AI generated streamers influencers Etc I actually think there needs that human element there's like that aura that exists uh they call it the um the aura Theory uh or an art Theory where it's like that human element needs to exist so for example I listen to a lot of this AI Drake stuff going on and some of the songs are crazy like if Drake's sang it I'd be like this is the top five song of Drake like they're incredible [Music] but there's like it just doesn't hit the same as as knowing that the actual Drake made this song right so I think the same thing is going to happen where like there's gonna be these incredible AI generated movies and scripts but I just don't think there's going to be an as large an appetite as people think of for audiences to consume this because like what we really crave beneath it all is the story is that human element the story behind the artist behind the Creator like I think it's the most disruptive Tech that I've seen since I've you know since the internet um but it's and it's going to permeate every like corner of culture and it's going to be like at the center of the cultural Zeitgeist but I don't think it'll have like this end-all be all effect that people are thinking I think the human element the creativity our Ingenuity I think it'll always be desired and craved and it'll always be you know most important and Central to me but did you see what Warren Buffett said about AI the other day I did yeah so he compared it to the atom bomb yes he did so he said and I quote it can do all kinds of things and when something can do all kinds of things I get a little bit worried I am personally skeptical of some of the hype that has gone into artificial intelligence I think old-fashioned I think old-fashioned intelligent works pretty well what are your thoughts I agree I think it was so I think it was Monger that said that the latter part where he said uh he's like I'm skeptical of it old-fashioned intelligence is good enough um you know I don't I don't know if you would ask me a year ago I would have probably agreed but now like we're looking at all the top AI researchers and sort of gurus in the world and the people that know this best um and five years ago they all suspected that AGI would come in the 2070s 2080s at minimum if not longer and now a lot of these guys are saying hey look this is sort of inevitable for the 2030s some you know Kurzweil and and um carpathy and others they're saying maybe by the end of the decade and so I think AGI changes everything right like right now it's still pretty mathematical like AI right for those of you for the people who don't know can you define what AGI is yeah so AGI or ASI artificial general intelligence or artificial super intelligence is this idea where the machines become as capable of humans right like they've become as smart creative and shrewd as us for all intents and purposes and uh basically where like our species won't be needed as much anymore right like that's the sort of like ominous idea behind it and um because because right now like AI is incredible but it still very much Works under mathematical constraints right like it's all this is the information it's just synthesizing the information and outputting it in the debate in in the way that it thinks is best for the end user based on all these data points but eventually there's people out there that suspect that it's going to gain sentience for all intents and purposes it's going to gain creativity um and I think if and when that happens it just changes everything and it's like almost impossible it's almost like a futile exercise to predict what's going to happen because that's going to be so world changing that we don't know like it's it's ominous by nature but I just tend to I try to stay optimistic because it's happening no matter what so let's figure out how to best approach it I love it well and then a positive note dude Roberto you gotta come back again you're anytime man I love this dude I'm such a fan

Description:
Email and SMS can be hugely effective forms of retention marketing, if done right.

Here are three stages along the retention marketing journey:

1. Creating fun and excitement around the brand without selling

2. Understanding what the customer needs to know at their point in the journey

3. Personalizing your message so it seems crafted specifically for that customer

anything tied back to retention marketing if you think of your goal as a like a bus ride it's got three stops on the bus the first stop is actually just excitement and good content it's just about getting mind share to be the top five or a top 10 thought in somebody's head at any given point then I think stop two is understanding does this person actually need to see our brand again from a sales standpoint say you sell deodorant and somebody's on a deodorant subscription they actually don't need to see that you're running a sale because you don't want them to unsubscribe and now buy from the sale the third stop is actually sending that message and when you send that message it has to be sent in a way where it feels like it was written just for you

[Music] [Music] Austin Lieberman everyone welcome to the show [Music] Greg how are you thanks for um not blocking me when I replied to your your post with your new YouTube video okay let's let's maybe start with that so I've been working really hard on growing this YouTube channel as in the last few months and I'm on Twitter and I've started tweeting about it and then bam you come in what happened tell the story yeah um you so I've been a fan of yours for a long time and learned a lot from you and um I know you've done various different things that have been like super successful and then so I saw you share uh this YouTube video and I go and check out your YouTube channel and the first thing I see when it is um the title is everything I learned this week I was like okay so the thing about YouTube is like it's I've been trying to learn it as well and I think it's a huge change for people that have um very large Twitter accounts or like a very large account somewhere else YouTube is is so big and has so so many people viewing it that 99 of the people on that platform have never heard of you and never heard of me especially and so I think um what a lot of people do who have huge followings on other platforms um is they kind of assume that that like the audience on YouTube is is gonna have is gonna know them and have the same kind of like trust Equity that you've built up with your followers on Twitter over so long or in your email newsletter or whatever I I think a mistake that I've made and and that I sort of like alluded to in my reply to your Tweet was it almost felt like you were assuming that people that watched that video know you and and so you like I watched the first 30 seconds or minute of the video and I I still had like no idea what the video was about and what value I was going to get out of it and while I know you and I know the value that you bring on a regular basis so I was willing to watch that because I've I've followed you on Twitter for a long time 99 of people that watch that video and come across that video are not gonna do that and so they're immediately gonna flip away and so that was kind of what I called out like there's a few best practices if you will that I've I've learned and biggest one and this is like a Mr Beast thing right where it's like within the first 20 to 30 seconds you have to get people's attention and tell them what value they're gonna get out of watching the video at the beginning of the video just tell like literally the simplest thing just tell them why they should watch it you know if you're putting a million Orbeez in a pool don't start the video with you shopping for you know your mom's birthday present at the beginning of the video just say we're gonna put a million Orbeez in this pool and so yeah I mean that that was the reply and um I just found that on that piece sorry not sorry to interrupt but on that piece we're recording on YouTube right now what value are people gonna get by watching this video yes that's great so this should be like what this video starts with uh by watching this video I think people who are maybe working a job and wanting to be a Creator or make like monetize their brand online uh and learn how to transition from working a full-time job working on their like Creator passion part-time to actually turning that into a business uh that's kind of what my journey has been like and I think that they'll learn some actual tactics and I'm happy to share the process that I've used over time to not make millions of dollars from my own business right now I think that's possible in the future but to make like a livable income and if if nothing else then you make a nice side income while you're working a full-time job that's that's I think what like the most value I can bring to your to your viewers and your your audience to love that and maybe let's start with YouTube um if you're trying to build an audience on YouTube how do you think about that I I think like in in my opinion YouTube is the best place for people to start building an audience outside of also having an email newsletter or a way that they can capture people's emails and and information and be able to contact them on a regular basis um why do I think YouTube is the best place to do that because it's they've they've got uh massive a massive audience hundreds of millions of people if not over a billion people um on YouTube over the course of a month and there's uh literally nothing stopping you from from getting started they have amazing analytics so you can you can see the results of what you're doing um and it's automatic monetization so once you reach the YouTube Partner program which is I think it's a thousand um subscribers and 4 000 watch hours which feels like a lot you automatically start getting paid for your videos you don't have to have any relationships with getting your own advertising or finding your own Brands and sponsors you can do that in addition to the automatic AdSense that you get paid from YouTube um and then in addition to that every single video you can in in the description and on your channel you can link to to the digital product that you're selling the course that you might sell your email newsletter which is which is what I do and affiliate links in in the description so yeah I think YouTube is an incredible place to start this is what I did I started in 2022 I guess it was I think it was March of 2022 started actually creating on YouTube um and have gotten to a point that um I think in December of 22 maybe it was October uh it was I don't know somewhere between August and October of 2022. I'm having like screen sharing we can go over the analytics um I got monetized on YouTube and and am now making anywhere between um 300 to 800 a month just from ads AdSense on YouTube that they automatically place I'll show I'll show mine if you show yours let's do it let's play that game yeah let's do it so I'm gonna share my screen right here so I make so I I have YouTube earn or AdSense enabled I recently did it I'm making about a hundred dollars a month I actually you can even see like I if I go to there and tab over here I literally haven't even put in my banking information um That's how little I care about the hundred dollars a month um because to me I don't care about the the actual AdSense like to me the value is in like I I have a bunch of businesses um that I run um and if I um sort of plug it in the YouTube video like that's gonna be worth a hundred times more uh than you know the hundred bucks a month so the way I see it and I think you know the reason I bring this up is a lot of creators actually are not going to even care about the ad sensor or earn part of it um in the ad part of it but you know just really care about plugging their products within the YouTube videos yeah so a couple things though is like that AdSense is just a reflection it's a reflection of a couple things right the amount of viewers that you get on your video shows the amount of time that they're engaged with your videos the uh it's also based on kind of like the quality of the viewer and that that it sounds horrible to say this I'm not labeling people here I'm labeling people in terms of um how advertisers view them like how valuable advertisers view them and so that comes down to what country are they viewing from what's their age group and so even though that hundred dollars for you isn't meaningful I think it's still like whether we're talking about revenue or we're talking about views or view duration or the um geography or demographics of the audience I still think it's like a valuable metric because if that number's going up it means that you are getting a wider reach in a higher quality audience that's going to be ideal for you know your brands or or other people that you partner with totally oh don't get me wrong I wish that number was yeah you know 50x you know and that's why I brought you on the Pod to try to under you know help me you know yeah but I I just want to let people know though that like it's it's a metric to keep an eye on but it's for me not my core metric um if you go do you mind going to um analytics on the left side there and then go to audience um it's up top yep and uh and let's see you should so scroll down a little bit so here like this is where I think and and you may not even know this because again like your focus is on your businesses and not 100 on like YouTube analytics right but I've never been here by the way yeah so we've never been here this is where I think for you when you're thinking about like how you're positioning your and again like I'm sitting here giving you advice right when when you've been uh far more successful in your own businesses than I have so I just want to like openly say that but but how I think about this is is for you or any business owner um maybe it's a startup that has a YouTube channel and they're trying to use use it for top funnel demand generation or whatever you can the amazing thing about YouTube is is they have like some of the highest quality analytics in the world and so you can see where your viewers are coming from you can see uh their age group so if you go if you go up um so this might be easier if I share my screen and and just click around um you wanna do that yeah let's do that the other thing I love about YouTube for anybody who's thinking about starting a channel is you don't have to have a a following anywhere else to get really large on YouTube and I think like the next three to five years is gonna be more about especially as we see like Twitter deprioritizing um outside links and then trying to prioritize uh in the algorithm uh organically uploaded pictures and videos I think the next like three to five years is actually going to be about growing disconnected um audiences on different platforms and so what I'm trying to do is share less and less of my YouTube links to Twitter and just grow YouTube independently from growing Twitter and um and the same thing can be said about LinkedIn or whatever platform and I think the reason that's beneficial is because then in a way you're like diversifying your audience and you're not becoming too reliant on any one platform if you're kind of growing them all and and there's of course a risk of like trying to do too many things at once right so we should maybe focus on like one or two at a time but um and the other part of that is like if somebody's a huge fan of you on Twitter and you just mention somewhere that you have a YouTube they're gonna find you on YouTube like your super your thousand true fans are going to be fans of you everywhere but if you if you spread across you're doing organic uploads to each uh you you benefit from kind of like the natural growth drivers of each platform so okay um I've got my YouTube Studio open right now and I think the best thing that do is to maybe just we'll just jump into analytics and we'll go to estimated revenue for the month and so I've got uh I have 6400 subscribers and I've never paid a dollar for any type of organic um or I'm sorry like paid marketing or anything like that I do all the editing myself this is entirely you know self self-driven stuff and then the I think the the most important point is if we go to analytics and we go to audience you can see where people come from and the reason I want to point this out is because um just give me a second and maybe we can like we can edit this if we need here we go traffic Source right so I'm in analytics I'm in traffic source so I have 50 000 followers on Twitter and one of the things I did early on when I was starting the channel which I'm still early is I would link to every video on Twitter and you would think that that would mean that most um most of my views would come from Twitter but actually so if we go to Lifetime so we're going to Lifetime analytics this says 2016 that's because I uploaded like two videos a long time ago that anyways you could see where all this started this started in March uh or Yeah March of 2022. uh external so the views coming from external is 2.6 even though like the vast majority of my following anywhere online is on Twitter and I used to share a link to every video on Twitter it just to me goes to show you how independent you know these platform forms are and how the benefit of like growing on YouTube right and so the reason YouTube is so beautiful is these two right here that browse which is uh anytime somebody's on the home page of YouTube and you just are looking at what comes up on your dashboard that's what those are 51.6 of all of my views have come from browse that's why YouTube is like such an important top of funnel you know lead generation in my opinion and then YouTube search is at 30.6 percent and so when you create videos you sort of have to think about what are you prioritizing for are you prioritizing for browse the videos that people will see in their timeline and click on or are you prioritizing for YouTube search that is very much um you're gonna find what are the topics trending on YouTube what are the topics trending on Google analytics and you can just see it out there in the wild right like right now ai in anything AI related is getting a ton of search volume and so if I wanted to orient towards uh search then right now one of the most popular search topics in the world is YouTube or is AI and so I would start making videos about about AI but but those are the two important things and so then what decisions does that drive if you're going for browse or you're going for search I talked about search a little bit it all comes down to kind of like keywords and you would want the title of your video in the things you're talking about in the video to be very SEO friendly topics right and I'll talk about how I've worked on that in the past on YouTube with browse the by far the most important thing is the thumbnail and then the first like 60 characters in your title those two things have to grab people's attention immediately and get them to click on it and so yeah that's I mean that right there is where a lot of the demand comes from is YouTube itself which is why I'm such a fan of the platform if we go to um I'm gonna go to revenue here and uh get into why I think um for people who are like long form video creators and by long form I mean anywhere from uh eight to 12 minute videos is what I would consider long form I think shorts are actually a complete waste of time and um actually hurt your channel long term and so right now we've got my Revenue chart up and uh over the last 30 days I've made 206 dollars I was um traveling for two weeks so I didn't make a ton of videos and you can kind of tell I've got basically two videos done over the last I don't know 15 or 20 days or whatever Which is less than normal but if we go to Lifetime I've made 2959 from YouTube and again starting basically in August 8th of 2022 I made three dollars and 62 cents and the cool thing about YouTube is every video you make I heard Ali abdall talk about this every video you make is like its own little business right and it can generate revenue for you forever ever is a long time for however long YouTube stays relevant and people keep watching um but that's a cool thing and so I'll share kind of a cool use case but one thing you notice is there was a short period of time where I jumped from in in August I was making four dollars a day to 32 dollars a day on October 14th and I jumped to 86.58 on October 23rd and then it's like slowly gone down 54 November 2nd um November 9th 22 and so what happened there um I had one video that was super popular so let's see if we go to views 100 134 000 views on one video um my channel is about Finance stuff right which um you can make a YouTube channel about anything there's there's super popular YouTube channels about um knitting and Pokemon and stuff like that there is a difference in in the amount of Revenue you get paid per thousand views that's dependent on again topics you talk about and how it all comes down to how valuable your viewers are to advertisers and so um if we go to revenue right now we've got this my most popular video ever open 180-ish thousand views made 949 dollars from that video and if we go to the the way that you can see the kind of the value of your viewer comes down to RPM which is revenue for every 1000 views so I got paid seven dollars and six cents on this video for every thousand views right now it's got a hundred and thirty four thousand so I was off whatever whatever I said before 134 000 views um so 134 times 7 is how we get to that 900 that it made and then you know YouTube right here in CPM which is the playback cost for every thousand views that tells you how much YouTube is charging advertisers to advertise on your video so that is 19.56 for this video I keep seven dollars and six cents which in my my opinion is very fair for the Creator and um this just shows the potential of of each video on YouTube and the cool thing you can see is is that I made trying to show how much money this video has made over time um and so I made um 28 on it on October 14th I made 77 on this video on on October 23rd but even since then every single day I'm getting paid you know some amount of money for the people that are watching this video and I don't have to do anything to it right and so then Greg I guess this just comes back to you know talking about um the value of YouTube either to somebody who is trying to create income themselves and this is something that um I do was doing on the side while I was working I literally made this video while I had a full-time job 40 plus hours a week and I'm in the Air National Guard which takes time I was still able to find the time a lot of it I guess is because I work from home and maybe I wasn't always working you know when I should have been or whatever but I think a lot of people are in that situation um this was something I was able to do on the side and and so when you think about the macro economic situation we're in people are losing their jobs like how valuable is that for people whether you're a founder or not and you're trying to Market your product or you're just an individual trying to make some extra money to be able to make 949 dollars from a video that you create um on the side like there's a lot of things that you can do with that money and then um on a you know on a monthly basis um and go back to overall um Revenue uh this is a decent amount of uh income for somebody on the side I'm trying to get to so here's kind of the revenue growth all this is my total Channel Revenue per month um August I mean the crazy thing is it's the growth right like the growth in it you I mean you've been going from 100 bucks you have you know some months over 900 but you know um you're just seeing that like if you continue doing this like it's not crazy that you 10x the amount of Revenue you get you just have to like stay the course and then then all of a sudden you're making you know thousands of dollars a month um and that's when you hear about like creators you know quitting their job and going full time on YouTube yep and and the other thing that comes with this too and you have to like balance this is is I don't do any um I haven't done any brand deals where all everything we're looking at right here on this chart which if you're listening to this I'm just showing the chart of Revenue over time it started 112 bucks in August um has slowly gone up and then I had a few breakout months um December November and October was 300 740 and then 922 um either way it's it's slowly turning up and then you have kind of like a breakout month but still the average is still kind of trending up over time the thing about that is like as that gets bigger and as you get more views it attracts things like Brands reaching out wanting you to feature their product in their video as part of the video that's additional Revenue but the other thing too is like startups reaching out that need Consulting and they need they're trying to grow people who like there's a number of different things that you can do from YouTube and so um again like there's millions of people out there that have like far more successful businesses than me and and all of that stuff I'm by no means trying to say I'm the most successful Creator in the world but I guess just what I want to share with people is like you could do this I have zero video training everything I Learned was through watching people do it on YouTube and just like learning from other channels the place I got the idea for this video and I like told the person the place I got the idea for my most popular video ever and this this is the crazy thing about YouTube is like people have created the blueprint for you where I got this idea and made it my own was another Channel called uh decade investor and this is how I like come up with ideas for videos right like I'm not I'm not saying I'm the most creative person in the world and all these ideas are my own but I find similar channels to me so if you're creating a channel what I think you should do is find people that are not the biggest channels in the world so like I'm not looking at Ali abdall right now and trying to make videos like his because he's got three million subscribers on YouTube and his videos will be popular if he literally just posts a video with him as the uh in the thumbnail it doesn't matter what his video is about he's going to get a hundred thousand plus views that's not to take anything away from him but he's got the subscriber base to do that so if you're looking for ideas start with channels that are like mildly more successful than you and so I was looking at this channel um he's a friend of mine actually decade investor 33 000 subscribers I just went to most popular and he has a video that's called I'm retiring off just vo which is a an index fund I saw it had 211 000 views he made it a year ago so it's still like relatively um new or or you know that like it hasn't been that long ago and then I went and made a video that's called I'm retiring off just schd which is another ETF and like here's the thing here's the secret is like is it a little clickbaity yes but it you have to make the connection in the video to where the thing in the title and the thing in the thumbnail is related to your video it doesn't have to be like a hundred percent what the video is uh but it has to be like related and believable um for people to actually watch the video right and so um like you don't have to come out and have all of your own ideas you can look at at what other people have done that has worked and there's a tool I don't know if you use this Greg but it's called tubebuddy and so it's like 50 bucks a year I pay for it you can go to launch keyword Explorer now and so um I make Finance stuff but let's let's say we we want to make a video about um uh chat GPT right I don't know people have probably never heard of that but um so uh how to use chat GPT you come in here and do Jake by the way what's that I I that was a good joke thank you I hope everybody's laughing um and anyways you could just put kind of like the title in here and use this tool to get an idea and again like a business owner could use this to to think about um marketing their products or whatever so it doesn't have to just be for you know YouTube nerds like me um how to use chat GPT what this tool does is this side of the tool tells you how your channel ranks compared to other people that are making these videos so we can see the search volume on YouTube for chat GTP GPT is excellent that's good but the competition is there's a ton of competition so if I go right now and make a video about chat GPT after never talking about on my channel before I'm probably not gonna like have that much success because you you don't have that that following and that kind of like brand equity on YouTube to be popular and then the optimization strength tells you how well are the videos that are out there optimized are the people optimizing for for keywords and titles do they have a good thumbnail that's kind of what that score is but what I do and the way that I use this is I'll come up with the title and figure out what my video is going to be about and then here on this the right side here this tool gives you all of the keywords and the tags that people have used and so kind of an immediate thing people can do to improve their their YouTube is to just start using a tool like this and start to improve the topics that you're doing and make sure they're topics that at least have you know somewhat of search volume and then use keywords which there's a back and forth about like whether or not you even need keywords but if you're a small Channel I think you need to be doing everything you know to put the odds in your favor you just copy all of these um to the video tag limit you can copy all of these and then when you go to uh create a video you could just like put those in in kind of the keyword block I won't go through that right here but that's the main thing the other thing I do is I look at the results here and I see like what do these thumbnails look like and it in I just use this for me to get an idea of like which one would I click on um and and then are they popular or not and so the the basics of thumbnails though is like you should never have again unless you're like some massively popular Creator already you should never have more than like five words on on your thumbnail and even you know you should even try for under four because people when if you're browsing YouTube you're just like scrolling across your screen right and so if it's more than four or five words like people aren't sadly aren't going to take the time to read that um and so that's what I'll do is I'll just look at some of the the titles and see kind of what they look like and then um I just make all of my titles in canva and uh I've got like a couple a couple templates in here that I use and I see the ones that are um most popular and when I say most popular I mean I have the best um click-through rate and we can jump into to click-through rate but what you'll notice wait going back on those templates are those templates that you created uh yes these are ones that I created and um yeah basically um it I just kept it simple though like and different things are gonna work for different channels right um for people listening I'm just just got like a black background here I make Finance stuff so I've got the name of the company I'm talking about in on the thumbnail which in this case it's Amazon and then something big and shocking right uh the title here is just bought ninety thousand dollars which uh is another thing like it's not investment advice I don't recommend anybody who want to do that um it was true I did that and it's kind of a shocking thing right so it uh that drove a decent amount of of views but the way that you can you can judge that is impression click-through rate and so what I'll do the thing is is like you can't see anybody else's click-through rate so that's the tough thing um and then I always wonder like well how is my click through rate versus everybody's else and the truth is I don't know but um what I can see is that that title that I just talked about why the title of the video is why I just bought ninety thousand dollars of Amazon stock um the the thumbnail has um two words on it and a company name the click-through rate is 14.4 percent which is extremely high uh you know in my own numbers and a little bit of research I've done if you can get over seven percent over a seven percent click-through rate then that's great and so that's what I'll do is I'll look at my videos that have performed the best anything over a 10 click-through rate then I'm Gonna Keep testing you know those Style videos and those style um titles and topics and so the other so the other thing Greg that I'll share is like it's when you find something that works uh double down on it um I'm trying to scroll over and so I started my channel off talking about kind of like my investment journey and individual stocks well then I made this video about schd which is a an ETF exchange traded fund and it got 134 000 views well then I tried to make more videos about uh schd and ETFs right and like all of my most popular videos now are basically about schd and about ETS and so we're kind of getting off topic Greg from kind of like what your point was you know you use YouTube for your Brands and stuff like that if if you're using it for a business for yourself and monetization yourself and make an income yourself if you find something that works and you enjoy talking about it and double down on that because um there were 1 million people that that schd video that I made the original one I made has one million impressions uh how many people use YouTube daily so that video got one million impressions YouTube has 122 million daily visitors and so if you find something that works 99 of people on YouTube have never seen it and never heard of you so you can double down on the same thing um the other thing about YouTube and I'm I keep going all over the place but whatever uh hopefully this is helpful um most people who watch your videos are not your subscribers um they are just random people on on YouTube and the way that you can tell is by going to traffic Source subscription status so uh not subscribed for me so this is over the last year people not subscribed to my channel 81 of My Views uh people that are subscribed to my channel 18 of views and so you need to um like if people subscribe to your channel they need to kind of like get what they came for to to stay subscribed don't limit Yourself by thinking um if you if you make this video your subscribers aren't gonna like it or it's different or whatever the vast majority of people out there um that are watching your videos and again on on YouTube have like never heard of you and never seen you and so um that's what I think about and and I'm just like willing to test new things um let me show you just showed me a hundred things in my and my mind is like my jaws dropped literally like I'm trying to pick it up from the floor and I'm gonna show you one thing so go to go to your dashboard okay like your um like you're just my main yeah your main YouTube Studio dashboard yeah yeah so yeah we run a bunch of agencies and sometimes I drop on YouTube Hey like we have this Innovation agency we have this design agency we have this you know organic SEO agency that's Ai and we have this you know AI engine it's all like drop that and if you scroll down um on this page like the main page recent subscribers got it this to me is like so valuable that I think people don't really like it you know talk about so you can actually we see who subscribed to your channel and also sort them by you know date subscribe but off but also subscriber count I was noticing like I had like some pretty big people yep who started subscribing to the where it happens YouTube channel and I just reached out to them some of them so for example one of them was a senior leader at a Fortune 500 company I reached out to him and he was like stoked that I reached out he was like whoa like I subscribed to your channel yesterday you reach out all of a sudden like we're closing a six-figure deal on one of like a really cool company doing like Innovation work and design work and prototyping all from YouTube that's that's awesome and thank you for sharing that because I had literally never looked at that part and and I think that goes a show like why YouTube can be so valuable for so many different reasons depending on what you're using for like that is like the perfect use case I think for like you to be using YouTube for and so then then it can down to different things right it's like what is your um your purpose for using YouTube or whatever platform and you you do kind of have to optimize for that right and and not so back to like this whole conversation so for you like yeah it totally makes sense I think to optimize for the things that the your most valuable sounds bad but it's like your most valuable viewer uh optimized for that which means yes you you may give up views because you're not going to have the most viral titles in the world because that's not going to attract the person that like is the most valuable to you and your business and your life but I still think like there's definitely opportunities to increase that that pool as much as possible back like to the best Practice Things is like making sure in the first 30 seconds of your video the uh people know what you're talking about basic thumbnail stuff like you know things things like that I think like um can still be super valuable but that's a great point where and that that's kind of why I think like YouTube shorts for most people at least right now is a total waste of time because like um if you think about the audience for shorts and and I'll just talk about me specifically my goal with YouTube is like a couple things primary way I make money online right now is through people subscribing to my paid email newsletter um and so everything else I do Twitter Youtube whatever is all in my opinion top of funnel to try to funnel more people into my email newsletter eventually um I I try to provide like a lot of free value on these different channels I think that's like how you grow an audience what that means is that um I like it's tempting on Twitter or on YouTube even to to try to make shorts or on Twitter to do like these memes that go viral and get millions of views and stuff like that like if you do that and you have some meme that goes viral on Twitter like how valuable is that really to me getting somebody to trust me enough to then sign up for my newsletter and do it and start a paid subscription I don't think that's really valuable and every time I think I do that I go down that route I think I'm like losing a little bit of um brand Equity if you will with the people who are most valuable the thing about shorts and I don't even know if I have any on here I guess I still do so I shared my RPM of my videos it's around seven bucks around my long form videos and uh YouTube Studio like the analytics platform is like so robust it's like just just insane yeah you can spend like a month on this and still like only scratch the service with the shorts I I shared my long form videos get about seven a seven dollar RPM seven dollars per thousand views shorts for me right now and I've looked and this is kind of um what other people are getting as well six cents per thousand views is what I get from shorts that is 100 times less than what I get for my long form videos and so what that means is like we talked about how um these videos can your growth can kind of be like exponential over time right and so if I'm at um a seven dollar RPM seven dollars per thousand views well if I get a million views on YouTube that would be seven thousand dollars a month that I'm getting paid just from YouTube and so if you break that down I I do Finance stuff so again everybody's different but I would share my own stuff I do Finance related stuff I could and I can I don't have a lot of editing I'd literally just like Film It Make Some Cuts where I sound like an idiot and then I still sound like an idiot a lot but I sound less like an idiot and then post it right and so I can realistically do um we'll say 90 videos a month I'm bad at math so we'll just call it 100 videos a month right and so 100 videos a month to get to a million views would be 10 000 views per video I think I don't know if that Matt's right I've I've seen it in my numbers that I can have a video that pops to 130 000. I on average right now I'm getting over time like five to six thousand views per video it is a very realistic goal for me to get to that number over time if I keep working at it in in my opinion what is not realistic for me is to get enough views on shorts uh to make that six cents per first short like actually work out economically for me but then beyond that what happens is you may grow your subscriber base from doing shorts but are those people who subscribe to your channel to watch a less than one minute video a are they the type of person who um if you're on it to Market something that that would be valuable for you to Market to and then B are they the type of person that's also going to watch your seven or eight or nine minute video and if they're not and if you now all of a sudden have 500 000 subscribers on YouTube but none of them care about your long form videos YouTube's algorithm starts to think like well this person's subscribers are seeing these videos and not even clicking on them they must not be very good or if they click on them and watch and click off you know like quick and so your view time is low it you start to get penalized from YouTube's algorithm and so um I guess that's just like a word of caution like I've been very tempted and I've actually started working with an agency and paying them to like work on some short form videos and I just decided that like when I really thought about it and after seeing kind of this RPM stuff and then think thinking through it that it's really not worth my time or the money to pay somebody to edit them because that's a whole other thing and I would be much better off just focusing on long-form content and and kind of like sticking to what has worked already right so it's like really tempting to to go with shorts and it's exciting that there's monetization there but like six cents per thousand views to me is just not like worth it not livable okay I I had a few game-changing insights that you said so one is the Ali abdall each YouTube video is a business and I think the framework for thinking about that is just really smart because it all the insights that we have to building startups and businesses I.E build a minimal viable product test optimize like all the basically all the learnings that you you have from building startups you can apply that to YouTube so I think that that was a huge light bulb for me my only edit to that quote is it's not that each YouTube video is a business it's each each YouTube video is a product and you optimize the product so that was that was really helpful to me the other the other thing I learned here is I've actually been spending a lot of time thinking about shorts but not enough time thinking about long form which makes no sense because I was like oh if I need to grow my subscriber base I need to you know go to shorts spending a lot of time and money on these shorts when I should be really thinking about what is the process for coming up with titles thumbnails um optimizing that flow using tools like tubebuddy or vid IQ to to basically help me help me there even though to be honest I kind of hate that and I hate it because I love art not science and to me this feels like more of a science so I I I'm I'm not gonna take I like I'm just gonna be straight with you I am not going to do everything to optimize my YouTube I'm going to do the minimum amount I want to optimize me having fun with this channel too like as soon as I do that sort of stuff and I'm optimizing optimizing I lose that fun bit so I think it's important for folks to don't over optimize is is sort of another Insight I have what else do you want to leave people with before we rap yeah yeah exactly so that's a really good point Greg is like I talked a lot about optimization don't be intimidated by um thinking everything has to be optimized and then like not start right like the most important thing that anybody can do if they're thinking about starting is just get started and um your your thumbnails are going to be bad your videos are going to be bad you're going to ramble your editing is going to be bad you're um have a good mic because like your audio matters far more than video quality but but aside from that and by good mic uh 60 bucks you can get a good mic aside from that if you're thinking about doing this get started and then just it's like so common like improve one percent every every time or whatever um just get started and then work on one thing at a time that you want to kind of like fix and improve and improve it and so the one I felt the exact same thing as you um Greg not just about like YouTube but about um social media in general right like I started on social media when I was active duty in the military and like literally especially my career field everybody made fun of me for like being on social media and um I was like oh that's like uh whatever I I I'm and then I was like oh okay social media is dumb I'm not gonna do that well now social media has turned out to be like the most important and most valuable thing I've ever done for my personal income and personal life it allowed me to get a job after leaving them at like so many things and I would say the same thing about like optimizing at least a little bit and and not even optimizing but I think just don't create barriers to your stuff being found that you could easily avoid is I guess the way I'll put it in and then the reason for that is like yes it needs to be fun for you to keep doing it so it certainly don't over optimize but if you believe in what you're doing and you think like more people your passion for it which you clearly do and more people need to find it which I think they do they learn from you like you and I kind of have like and if we think what we're doing is valuable we have an obligation to help as many people find that as possible while not being tacky and so I just try to at least do some things to like not get in my own way and and you know some simple things to to help um more people find it so that's that's I guess like what I I will import all my wisdom on you Greg is like yes don't optimize to where you don't make it fun but you have important stuff to say that's valuable to a lot of people so just like help more people find it basically appreciate you for coming on Austin where uh where could folks find you on YouTube uh yeah if you search Austin Lieberman you'll find me on YouTube on Twitter I'm Lieberman Austin and then my sub stack is austin.substack.com um thanks for having me and I've been a huge fan of yours for a long time so this is this is really cool I love it and um I appreciate you I I know you don't give Financial advice but I definitely watch your sphd video and I definitely bought some PhD after that so good there you go cool all right well cool man this is fun later

actually in the weeds process that I think everybody should try and do is first write out what you're going to say then go and record it on your like voice notes then once you have that audio draft go and look at the words that you're saying in the video and think about is there any archival footage any camera roll footage any footage that correlates to the words that I'm saying in this story and then go and place it over it now you have a compiled video that is completed with audio only file b-roll filler content and then I go a step further and add text over top of it but that's a formula

you're able to upload data about someone's habits how they talk where they live demographic data and then basically speak to them in a way that they really want to be spoken to I'd pay for that service the key question is do you actually have that data some of the bigger retailers and e-commerce players like the Amazons of the world have so much more data that they actually have an unfair Advantage if they want to go down this route because you could get into a situation where you know your car they bought operates at 50 but Amazon's car they bought operates at 100 or 97 but that's where it gets kind of scary that as we enter this AI age there's an unfair Advantage for the large players not the small startups

If brands want to build a following online, they need to act more like human beings.

People don’t want to be sold to on social media, they want to be entertained.

“Brands do a good job of this by creating original content that’s contextual to the platform and entertaining to watch.”

[Music] this is a special where it happens episode we've got a criminally underfollowed guest violetaba [Music] [Music] uh The Man Behind the Scenes co-founder lay check out CEO everyone's been asking me who the hell is running the show and uh figured I'd bring the man in the myth The Legend on the show so welcome what's up Jesus nice to see you back in Quebec good to be here to wood stove behind you it's cozy yeah there's a light fire behind me if you're watching on YouTube it's it's nice and I I felt like this was the proper setting in order to have this conversation um you know you come from a small town uh in the woods around here um and uh and now you you were you know you've run a bunch of companies like did you ever think you'd be doing this no definitely not didn't even know it was a thing uh although I think you opened my eyes to back in 2012 the world Beyond Montreal which was cool because I was in it to win it at Molson Coors slang and beer and having a good time to the wee hours of the morning and then my eyes opened up to the land of possibilities and startups and all that good stuff and for context there you were selling beer to bars right selling beer to bars for those who know anything about beer Newcastle is a brand that Molson had Acquired and was Distributing kind of also running Coors Light late night boat parties events at bars yada yada the lifestyle got old real quick so fast forward to today because I think you know I want to just talk about today and and where we're going and just sort of have a frame conversation about what we're doing well what we're not doing well and and here we go so you know late checkout is a holding company meaning we run or a company that builds companies so we've got boring marketing we've got you probably need a robot we've got the late checkout Innovation agency um dispatch with the design subscription etc etc I know it's hard to choose a favorite kid but what what project are you most excited about which one of these companies so I think uh good question I'm going to ask you the same question so you can ruminate on that as I said with this um I don't need a ruminate you know yeah you've got a favorite childhood yeah of course you do um so I think it changes actually from like week to week month to month um today for example in the Innovation agency jamming with a bunch of execs from one of the biggest tech companies in the world and we were like talking about product design Frameworks relating to states of widgets and how the levels of commitment it was just like this is awesome I love doing this this is like just raw product in the pixels a lot of fun this month though the studio the evolution of the studio and all of those companies that you name dropped seeing what they've been able to do with a little bit of Greg jet fuel some like badass operators and a really good idea has been Next Level so dispatching the subscriptions grow has been a ton of fun so last week it was like four new subscriptions piling onto what we already had I was really jazzed about dispatch we were kind of doing the video for product hunt launch you know Shameless what is dispatch for people who who don't know what that is great question dispatch batch is our design subscription service so what that means is you get access to a team of world-class designers for a fixed monthly fee and essentially you subscribe to this board where you get unlimited design requests and we will fulfill them one after the other for you across graphic design brand product design all the way up to animations illustrations and Beyond yeah and you know the reason we're able to do it for so cheap even though it's like high-end design is we use international I.E non-us designers and AI enhanced productivity and we just sort of uh also we have tons of UI kits that we've created so it's really just leveraging a lot of the stuff that we've built already to make things go faster yeah it's a great call out after three years in the agency the systems we've built and the kind of like team bondingness and like just how we work together has like made speed an unfair advantage and also just efficiency and so yeah we're able to dispatch it dispatch is your favorite child right now like I said it changes you know wake up one morning it could be dispatched like in the afternoon it could be you probably need a robot because I get a glimpse of that subscriber count and then boring marketing is the channel of new inbound keeps lighting up my slack I still can't believe how many people want in on boring is pretty astounding if I had to choose one let's roll with dispatch for now one of the questions a lot of people ask me is you know with a product Studio you can do anything meaning the world is your oyster um but the issue with that is you can do anything so how do you know when to cut a project how do you know like when it's you know time to either I guess the question for you is is this how do you know to cut a project or to add jet fuel into a project yeah a great man once said when you get product Market fit you know you know when you know you know and that was you um for those who didn't catch onto sarcasm but uh I think it's a it's a bit of a nuanced thing we have a system for standing up new projects we now have like a badass checklist we have a really interesting formula on how we create companies and what we need to make them work essentially how do we actually take the BET and are serious about it when we do that we've seen in the past that some things just don't catch on or pick up like we thought they would and I think it's a case-by-case basis we don't have the perfect rubric for saying this startup is done it didn't hit the metric therefore it's done or the startup's incredible we need to keep investing again when you know you know and I think the early traction with dispatch and boring boring was a longer term commitment boring marketing for those who don't know what I'm talking about SEO agency very forward thinking and really kind of SEO for boring businesses or marketing for boring businesses it's going to be much more than that took a little longer to stand up but the vision was there and we knew it was part of our core offering uh dispatch a lot quicker in terms of Engagement and sales and kind of traction so to speak and robot was just I I still don't even know how to explain how quickly things had happened that have happened there so again I think when you know you know we do have metrics around it we do track those and we do check-ins structured as a team every month monthly business reviews and then we kind of get the Brain Trust together of all the operators of these businesses to check in and see how things are going have an honest conversation when you know you know I.E when it's working when you know you know in terms of when it's not working it feels like a slog it feels harder than it needs to be it's distracting tensions are higher and it doesn't quite fit in the family and I think that is be that was evident with a few of our past projects we put some money resources Etc behind them but at the end of the day we knew it just wasn't quite a fit and we ended up making the right call I think of sun setting those give an example of a project that we started and knew it wasn't a good fit and the reason why I'm asking this question is I want people like I'm a big believer that product studios are the future of building startups and I want people to leave this conversation with more information around okay I was gonna go build a startup but now I'm going to build a studio or hey I'm like an executive at this company and I was gonna go build this like one moonshot bet I'm actually gonna go build like a few of them so walk us through one project that failed how you knew and why did it fail sure I think a good one that I'll say is actually there were some indications of success and so even harder to walk away from but it's a good example nonetheless and I think coming back to what you want to arm people with the checklist we've created of what these businesses need to be really helps with understanding should I go build a studio should I go build a single project or invest in a single product and if I'm building the studio what am I building you have to hire an operator I get I.E if you're serious about it you need someone to kind of lead if there's no owner nothing will get shipped we want to make sure that it's a sustainable business in some way shape or form so a path to revenue why now has to be strong there has to be some kind of unfair advantage or reason why we might succeed we've had and you've had an Insight around creators and audience being real jet fuel to early adoption whether that be just to a newsletter at a Content play or whether it be to a service so those are a few criteria one thing that we did try back to your question on what studio project did we start really kind of invest in and then decide to pull the plug on we called it Dash you remember Dash Greg you were in those early calls man jamming on dash the future you know was our oyster we were excited we were going to change the face of design and hiring for junior designers we were going to get them hired and the best ones Rising above and getting them hired at the best tech companies in the world really cool idea really cool Vision we did this through design assignments so you had to come in you submitted your email we sent you a design assignment all the best submissions we would forward and pass along to the best tech companies in our Network and we try and get you hired two problems maybe three but let's start with two one is we promise feedback for every submission so I know Airbnb Brian chesky do things that don't scale maybe that's a y combinatorism we did things that didn't scale which was giving personalized feedback to every design subscription damn even with rubrics even with all of the systems we put in place that did not scale very personalized very high touch people loved it but it didn't scale two our hypothesis that there were incredible Junior designers out there willing to do these assignments good enough to get hired at some of the best tech companies at least the ones we got were slightly disproven no one actually stood out to a degree that we felt really good putting our stamp of approval on we had a couple of referrals a couple people do interviews which was cool but at the end of the day it was a different problem that we were solving it wasn't actually our hypothesis was proven false essentially and third was Revenue there was just no clear path to revenue with Junior designers folks who were looking to get into the game with essentially not an established career or job they didn't have a ton of income to spend on education on content etc etc and companies I don't think we're willing to pay for access to that talent and it became especially true as the market deteriorated as more and more designers were getting laid off from Big tech companies like basically their willingness to spend money to basically get connected with Junior designers became less and less exactly Stars aligned you had a really cool Insight early on which was hey let's at least capture the emails to get the assignment we had a version of it where it was just the assignment and every day the assignment would change we pivoted and made it an email capture you got the assignment when you submitted your email so that was cool we got thousands of emails it started to work really well we got high engagement organic growth but there was just no path to sustainability and success so we pulled the plug we are kind of like we're kind of numb to it now but like and we shouldn't be where we launched a thing thousands of people signed up then we had like some of the leading designers in the world tweet out oh my God there is this like incredible thing called Dash we had you know the head of design of I think like Netflix or something you know tweet it tweet about us and they got like 700 likes people were loving Dash and what made it so hard was we could have just I mean okay so I'll take the other side of the argument the other side of the argument is we ended the project too soon and we could have just pivoted our way to maybe like mid-level or senior or figure that out like why didn't why didn't we do that so great little saying super obvious but saying yes to something means saying no to something else and I think why we didn't do that is because one the agency was scaling like crazy and we were dedicating valuable time resources and brain power to a problem that yes we probably could have cracked but felt like it was taking precious resources away from something that was really gaining traction and we kind of capitalized on that momentum so that was one two is I think on that sink in that same vein there are other like the world is our oyster right there are other projects to start and you were already Brewing on a couple of new ones that you had in the hopper and those were those were already super interesting and I think both those were failures weren't they they were I wouldn't call them failures again is there failure and product I don't know there's definitely learnings but uh yeah not neither of them are here with us today you're right they're in the graveyard I don't know how big that graveyard's gonna be in five years man but I'm I'm stuck to check it out I mean if your graveyard isn't you know bigger than your house then you're doing it you're doing it wrong exactly someone needs to write that up yeah yeah so I think those are those are the main reasons uh or the main reason why we had to say no or why we chose to say no to it um and at the time I gotta say we weren't as kind of refined and pointed about how to do Studio well we didn't have like the operator model down pat we didn't have the checklist down pat maybe if we hired a full-time operator dedicated you know tens X tens of thousands of dollars to it and said let's go solve the problem or figure out how to we would have kept with it but I gotta say we were still a little younger in the game knowing what you know now would you know would you have quit would you have never started on that on that on dash no I think would have done it the same and wise I mean obviously like knowing what I know now maybe we would have changed the schema a little bit or change the value proposition a little bit but I'm not there's no regrets for what we did we learned a ton we got better at design as a result because we were reviewing essentially we reviewed over a thousand plus design submissions in a matter of a couple of months had to grade all of them came up with a grading system we just got a crazy good understanding of the talent pool out there and how to really evaluate great design we sell design we are world-class designers it made us better so even though you know we lost the battle I think we won the war the hardest if you were to ask me Greg what was the hardest part about that project for me personally I would say the hardest part was I knew from the get-go that this project was going to fail and I was like this is there's no like I just don't see how this is going to work and I just have to be like you know what I'm gonna I'm gonna say my opinion they're probably not gonna listen to me and we're gonna do it anyways and uh you know it happened I I did but I I must say like I was supporting it the whole way through right it wasn't like I was like oh I secretly want these guys to fail but I definitely said I think that's a challenge that a lot of leaders and companies have which is they want to enable their teams to grow and do be their best selves but at the same time like the only way to do that is to fall down and scrape your knee and then you know get back up so do remember a do you remember that and and B how could I have how could I have handled it differently I do remember that my friend I do I do remember those certainly calls thanks for reminding me I think you yeah but I think you nailed it right as like you embodied disagree and commit you disagreed but you come and usually that's the other way around usually it's the employees disagreeing with execs and committing it was a cool flip on its head of like you being like you know what like I don't see it but like let's go help you supported the promotion and distribution of it you kind of gave your feedback on a weekly basis you were with it and I think to your point like sometimes you just have to show not tell and this was a very bold example or bold way of doing that do you allow you you were able to show employees and Folks at late checkout how hard it is to stand something up and make something work especially this type of idea instead of just telling to build trust and build conviction and build again I think commitment to lay check out so it was a cool move and I would say that hasn't changed I think uh you know for those of you not watching on YouTube I'm wearing a 14 Costco sweater and uh I think I'd be wearing a 120 you know am Leon Dore if it wasn't for the dash failure was it with the dash failure exactly and I just was in a downward spiral spent all my money that's what I had to do hey um I want to come back too quickly to what your favorite project is right now favorite project right every kid yeah you kind of scared it away from that one but I'll sort of answer that question I'll give favorite projects right now with runner-up so favorite project right now obviously you probably need a robot.com yep like I'm I'm just having so much fun learning about uh different AI tools and where you probably need a robot.com as a free community for people interested in Ai and productivity and I created it based on a tweet I was just like hey is anyone else interested in the like this sort of thing and so to be at the center of it is really really cool and we're monetizing it via our AI agency and automation agency where we actually I don't know if you know this video you've got a lot going on but we we've sold ads on the newsletter um so that's cool um and the newsletter is almost I think it's at 56 000 subscribers in like 50 days so it's pretty crazy it's nuts you know I found out about the ads I got a message from Jordan that who's helping us run it and you'd stripe info cut the slack I was like okay what's this open it up I was like oh we're selling ads on the newsletter now amazing love it yeah it's cool though cool message to open that's what I mean by day to day you're just like oh man this is sweet another small step big win I want to come back to that I just want to give my runner up please do my runner-up is our core late checkout agency which basically acts as an innovation Agency for for I mean big Brands but also like fast growing startups you know you mentioned today that you were sitting in a room with the executives at you know a big Tech you know one of the biggest Tech platforms I I often have pinch me moments at the agency when I'm I'm getting to meet some like basically building an agent an innovation agency is kind of a cheat code to meet the most interesting people in the world 100 not only meet them but work and work with them learn from them and build with them which is like three more vectors that are just insane and could never come true otherwise and it's so cool because like they move companies and then they call you up and they're like hey Theo I need like I need an app or I need um I need something right so it's also fun just seeing how and tracking how they these people grow which I think not enough people realize that about agencies like if you get if you're able to attract like these pretty stellar clients you end up developing a pretty pretty sweet Rolodex yeah nuts at the client level I.E the company and at the person level to your point like you've had folks in your network which is insane jump from company to company and now we're getting to work at some of the coolest companies because they're doing their tour and so I think again it's just a huge unlock for us to be exposed to all this and then get to learn and build with these folks going back to Jordan and selling ads yeah one of the things that you do really well I think is you know building culture within hold codes and product Studios and I'm sure that transcends beyond that one of the channels that we have at lay checkout is the level up Channel talk talk to us about like I was just thinking we should have put the you know tag Jordan and level them up but talk to us about how you think about building remote culture for holding companies and product Studios with a team that's distributed yeah that's definitely the biggest challenge um the distributed fully remote team which we can talk about us getting together in a couple of weeks but um I think it starts with knowing kind of loosely what culture you want to build and that ladders up to what kind of companies or company you want to build or the whole code you want to build what's the vision why are you doing this what's your purpose go down a layer from that create the values to your point about the level up Channel that's one of our three values be surprisingly thoughtful put Community First and level up those are the three values that kind of guide the how we operate on a day-to-day basis and when you see when you see it come out in the work when you see it come out and how people communicate and when you see it come out and just how people act and the reflexes they develop and you can bucket it into one of those three or all of those three it's a really inspiring moment and I think again you want to give people the tools to succeed and the kind of guidelines on how to operate but you don't want to dictate how they should operate again you want to build culture not a cult and so I think for us having those values and then having people fill them in color in the line so to speak on how those actually show up and manifest has been really dope and yeah we have a level up Channel we call out people when they do amazing things and it's really cool to see the effect of everyone else jumping on and jumping into the kind of action and saying you know what this is sick we see a beautiful prototype or new revenue or a closed sale or X or Y and it's really cool to uh to see the community come together around those wins you mentioned like we are doing like an off site we often do these off-sites either fully team to get together or just some of you know different teams or subsections of teams or different pods um we're doing one in two weeks in Toronto like how do you like what do you hope to get out of like why are we doing this like why do we spend thousands of dollars on Retreats and stuff like that why is this a good use of money I think I remember last year how much we spent on this sort of thing and it was just Bonkers cancel up it was like before our session was coming it was it was Ferrari money you know like it was it was crazy but would we do it again I think so but I'm curious your perspective why do we spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on Retreats and bringing people together and that sort of thing when we started late checkout one of the things you told me was one you wanted to build a forever place to work and two you just wanted to have fun and I think like if you just get obsessive over the balance sheet on like every dollar being fully optimized and I'm not saying this isn't a good use of money I'll get to that second but if you start to obsess over the balance sheet and every dollar going to direct High leverage activities like sales like marketing like fulfillment like operations and you divest in community and culture and fun you might build a super successful business but is it the one that you actually want to build and be a part of and so I think when you said that and we tell people that when they join why are we doing it one man like just to connect and build some Community we are remote we are alone in our homes and in our offices you're out and about a little more but a lot of these folks are just kind of hanging out and haven't ever even met the team and so let's get together let's put faces to names in the 3D World and uh see how folks actually are and kind of stand next to one another shake hands and have a good time so that's one two is like I think on the fun note just have a good time and some spontaneity when you're together and you're just jamming you know usually you join a meeting it has a start and an end and a very strict end and you're there to accomplish something you're there to make a decision you're there to you know listen and learn in a one-on-one you're not there to just like see what happens that's a quote-unquote waste of time or not a good use of a meeting but in person just being able to jam whiteboard a bit have a beer have a glass of wine have a water whatever it may be go for a walk the [ __ ] that starts to brew the things that start to happen are really interesting and I think what comes out of that is like you can't put a price on that sometimes it's really really rich we purposely like don't even have very strict agendas for these oxides in 2022 we had two large off-sites one was in Montreal Canada and around here actually we also rented a literal Chateau um for the team and then we had one in Bali as well in Indonesia so we when we design our off sites we think a lot about how can we create these like kind of crazy experiences um with like very little agenda should we be having more of an agenda like do you have an agenda for the Toronto thing because I have like a basic idea what I want to get out but I'm I'm more interested in just hanging out yeah totally I think the memorable moments piece are like these kind of magical experiences is a cool way to frame it just something memorable again have fun like make it unique one thing is like who's going to be there and what out of that Brain Trust together can we kind of it's not extract but can we create and produce together that's high value I think strategy like we did a hackathon last on-site if you look at last year we had five teams create five companies in five days less than it was really in five hours and that was cool to see we had working prototypes we had a couple of really good ideas none of them turned into companies but it was a lot of fun just to code and design and collab this time around I think very loose agenda it will be a little bit of strategy around the studio um and a little bit of alignment on this agency which is also my runner-up for favorite cos and or Focus areas right now again it's hard to pick a favorite child but like lots of crazy opportunity there we're seeing a huge reboot in the last couple of weeks or a few weeks which is really interesting and uh I think talking a little bit about that is going to be worth a while it is a good time it's surprisingly good time to be an agency owner right now because a lot of companies are cutting staff or freezing hiring but they still need new products and new new businesses to go out there so they look at companies like like our lady checkout Innovation agency and they're like oh hey like I get to pay you X dollars and you're gonna ship this thing versus I gonna hire 10 people in New York and they're gonna have benefits and like I don't know when they're gonna ship it and so it is interesting to see this reboom of you know product and agencies right now I didn't expect it to be honest yeah and again that was kind of one of the catalysts for starting dispatch was kind of moving down Market a little bit our Innovation agency's premium top of its game the beginning of the year was a lot of people frozen and so dispatch I think was an elegant solution for a lot of reasons one of which was to move down market and we saw super high adoption and a great response but yeah I didn't expect it either I didn't expect it this early I thought maybe Q3 or four but to have an early Q2 is really cool how do you know when you're being too conservative or too aggressive so right now there's tons of talent that's coming online and I had two two or three interviews today of candidates that one year ago two years ago we would have never had the opportunity to speak to these people yet now they're like knocking on our door I a part of me is like we should hire all these people and we'll figure out things to do that's being aggressive conservative is being like Oh you know we're in the service we have a ton of services business it's like maintain like think about it as build profitable companies and as profit grows hire more people how do you think about conservative versus aggressive one I think is the opportunity and how rare or how common the opportunity is so when we're looking at a higher that's not a hell yes that's not a absolutely we need to hire this role today and they're good but there may be again everyone is unique here all snowflakes don't don't worry about that that's not what I'm saying but if the expertise plus the uncertainty feels common feels like we'll see it again I think you lean into conservation or being more more conservative if it's a like how are we speaking to this person their skills the fit again we optimize for fit less about hard skills and soft skills and like where they went to school and where they worked but more about fit with late checkout and how we roll if the fit is like off the charts and they're going to be a level up to the entire team and they're in a function isn't something super unique to one of our businesses only if all the stars are aligned to me it's like a conservative way to be aggressive like we have to jump on those opportunities and make put our best foot forward or make our best offer and so I think there's an opportunity factor that goes into it another one is just for us knowing what's going to be like a net positive and a net negative or a potential net negative and I don't know if we always have the answer for that but I think that boils down to are we acting on a short kind of dopamine rush because of recent events or is this like the right move for the long-term business because we are building a very long-term business the last thing I might add aggressive versus conservative and how do you know is I think for me there's something about like fit check and what we've created on having people kind of come in and date before we get married we've developed this system where people can come in and experience the late checkout universe and we can experience them in this very mutually kind of understood way where we do this quote-unquote fit check and that could last 20 days it could last two months it could last 90 days but what we do is we essentially kind of gauge and temperature check is this going to be a right long-term fit and I think with that we've avoided a ton of bad hires so to speak and we've also moved quickly and made a few really good ones and so I think the world is changing and slightly shifting to more people being open to those fit checks instead of All or Nothing we do something that I don't know if many people do we call it the nerd in Residence what is the nerd in Residence and why do you think it's a huge unlock to building products that people love you came up with that term I think I was calling it a contributor in Residence lame was calling it Creator in Residence lame like you came back with nerd in Residence and again in your marketing a way you speak I think that really hit the nail on the head so nerd in Residence is essentially someone who's focused on the new project who's obsessed with it and is thinking about it all the time loves what they do and again it doesn't feel like work to them because they absolutely love it and so when you have someone like that on the team and not only on the team but sometimes leading the project we're stacking the deck in our favor to staff it properly to get insights and Intel to resonate with the community which is really important to us and then three not take a bunch of brain power and energy away from you or I because we have someone in there thinking about it feeding us information and we are able to do what we do best to operate more Market grow and give kind of strategic recommendations on where to take it but the tactics and the obsession is done by the nerd yeah one of the big takeaways I think for us and why we develop nerd and residence was the late checkout model is very pick a niche then Niche down even more like go super Niche and when you're creating a product that might be for you know Volvo lovers you know people who drive Volvos like you need to hire someone who knows everything about Volvos right like who's been there done that who's like in the subreddit who's all you know goes to meet up so I think one way to get a unfair Advantage is by hiring some of these Community leaders or just like nerds um and when I say nerd I mean in like the most like loving way like you and I are both nerds you're like a climbing nerd Once Upon a Time pre-kids yeah absolutely yeah and uh I'm a nerd in my own right um maybe even a Volvo nerd so maybe don't want to give too much info about myself but [Music] is and was an unlock again a lot of other Studios and Innovation Labs have entrepreneurs and residents and they hire an entrepreneur who's quote unquote created a company before but to your point about us and the importance of resonating with the community and being authentic we can only be nerds and so many things our team can only be nerds and so many things so when you hire that nerd in Residence I think the unlock is tremendous for what a potential success or outside returns can be one of the things we do is our product managers the majority of them are designers it's unusual why why do we have a structure that way we believe in the power of design and what design can do for Brands and for product uh design is so much more than just how something looks it's really how it works how it feels and how it resonates with the community and how it shows up in the world again if like your personal reputation is your brand my brand is how people talk about me when I'm not in the room to use a Jeff Bezos quote scaling that up to a company level your brand is everything it's how people interact with the product how they talk about you how they don't talk about you how they use you and what they feel when they kind of interact and so when we hire design centered PMS or kind of PMS who are more rooted in design we want that design thinking to come through in the product strategy we want that design thinking to come through and how we create the products from the ground up business strategy is extremely important I can pair with them we have other folks who are great at that again the kind of nitty-gritty on how to go cross-functional how is this beneficial to the business in big ways what are the business models how do you get to revenue those are all key things but RPMs have that intuition and also have the foundational expertise in design so that they can put forth these product ideas that are just beautiful to look at and resonate with communities right away and resonate with products of clients right away which is really interesting it's such a storytelling weapon and such a product weapon that we I think will continue to do this why do you think we did it I think it's a culture thing that gets started off you know me and you really prioritize design and we have an insanely High bar for um a product to go out to either you know either ourselves or a client we run the same design Sprint methodology for ourselves as we do for our clients so as an example like you probably need a robot.com go check out that brand like it's it's not just like another beehive newsletter it's got like a lot of personality to it and I don't think we would have gotten that level of that brand if you know our PMS were not versed in in great design so I think uh I was very inspired I think Snapchat has a similar model where their PMS are product designers and that's because Evan Spiegel from Snapchat he is a designer so I love that we kind of have a stance like that and we're kind of like yeah like if you're gonna be at late checkout like you need to you need to be spending half your time in figma exactly every time in figma a quarter of your time on design Twitter and a quarter full time looking at beautiful products that we've churned out and trying to figure out how to do it um and get it done absolutely all right let's shift gears a little bit tiny recently when public 850 million dollar valuation as of today they are kind of you know I'll just put it out there they're kind of like our bigger older brother you know we're Canadian they're Canadian we're from the east coast of Canada they're from the west coast of Canada a lot of a lot of analogies there but I think we have our our thesis and they have their thesis what do you admire about tiny like what can we learn from Tiny that we can take back to late checkup one thing I think is like sticking with the problem or sticking with the process essentially just sticking with it and seeing through seeing their Vision through so 80 of success is showing up the other 20 is a mix of a whole bunch of things and I think what's cool is like how long they've been at this it's not a crazy long time but in startup terms it's it's like a decade and a half if I'm not mistaken that's right so for Andrew to kind of stick with this learn grow the agency fail almost lose it all as he's mentioned some stories continue really keep his eye on the prize which was like knowing that let's build metal lab or let's build this agency Build It Up offer quality again they're design Centric as well which is cool and then Pete took on a Model that we may adopt in the future we flirted with it um more on the acquisition front than on the building from scratch front um so I think the m a is a is a cool piece to build your hold Co out I also think Grassroots product Studio spinning things up with kind of the team that we have is also a really fun route for us right now and I think we'll stick with it for a bit but M A is not or just Acquisitions in general are not off the table um and I'm just an admirable it's admirable what he was able to do to just kind of stick with it and take it from zero to this it's really cool to see I remember asking Andrew what advice he has for me and I was actually up here during the summer time and it's like basically in the middle of nowhere the reception is horrible and I was like Andrew was one piece of advice you can give to us he was like like it was coming in and I was like and stop incubating that you know and I was like what and he's like I don't know what and you know incubating I was like what he's like it is he's like I'll say it again it's like incubating is way harder than buying like if I were you guys I'd be buying way more and my response to him was but I just love building like it's just fun it's way more fun and like you know we've we've done some M A 2022 we did our first M A and we're gonna be doing more of it in 2023 and Beyond but I think like well that's a core difference between us and them which is I think we just love building so much they build too like they've incubated other stuff but incubating is a lot of fun exactly and that boils down to like why we started this and damn dude like the day we stopped building and start buying cool company like it'll get huge and I have no doubt about that it's just is that the company we want to build as of the old code we want to build and I think we'll never lose the build we'll never lose the building element of what we do we'll never lose the product Studio but uh which is great as hard as it can be are there any other companies that you look up to in terms of seeing what they do and and and thinking like oh wow we should be doing more of that I think it's less about companies at this moment and more about people I think people's stories are more inspiring than company stories at the moment for me seeing folks who manage YouTubers for example and are like behind the scenes just calculated dangerous and like masterminds at building Empires but in a different way or creators just going after it being who they are showing up and again just putting in the work and taking it from zero to 100 is just really inspiring and then you can go a layer up to folks are even bigger uh and just doing this on all other scale and so I love to think more about people than companies and the people I think are more inspiring for me than the company so even folks we work with people in bigger companies starting companies speaking to them gets me way more fired up than looking at what other companies are doing and their success within our company you have a you're kind of known for theoisms as we call it um and and some of them you borrow from other people like I think you borrowed um was the latest one you said dress me slowly I'm in a hurry pretty sure Napoleon said that correct uh that murderer but uh that's Savage what uh one or two or three theoisms you can give to people and and you know why do you like those sayings why I like these sayings is it it captivates people instead of saying guys slow down so we can align everyone gets on the same page we agree on where we're going and then we can move quickly saying that theoism or you know just a great Snappy saying like dress me slowly I'm in a hurry people have to be like I get it it's like a great book title you're like [ __ ] I have to read that book they need to know more and so they ask and then it resonates and they remember and so I think the staying power of these sayings holds way more water than the actual substance of them and so that's why I like to say them because I like to say things to the team hopefully once maybe a couple of times but then it sticks almost like a principle so that when they they go and build after or they go and operate after or they go and do things after in the company they're able to take them with them and help them level up so there's quite a few I like um again very rarely are they mine they're all things that I've heard and again because of their staying power they've sticked with me one I heard from Andy Mr Elwood fences make good neighbors absolutely love that I think it's a texasism if anything and essentially what it means is like boundaries and clear definition of roles responsibilities what's kind of what am I focusing on where are you focusing on ownership is actually going to lead to way more happiness connectivity connection community and success in a company then everyone just guns blazing and figuring it out so fences make good neighbors is one that I love another one I love is from Tim Ferriss which is how do we win even if we lose if you can like train the team to think like that and also train yourselves to think like that I like to think of like writing I've started writing this year it's a great practice to develop to develop I'll lose in terms of like maybe I won't get to a million followers I don't actually know if that's the goal but I'm winning by developing this practice and clarifying my thinking and so how do you win even if you lose is another one I love there's so many more you wanna you want me to keep going like I have them all again they're just swimming around here is there any you want to give us a couple more one that's maybe less applicable to work that I love is the dose makes the poison I think this one to me is really all about balance and that everyone is unique you know Greg you've been living up living it up in Miami you're probably pretty pretty good with the Sun by now I haven't seen the sun in six months so like sunshine is good but then it's bad and I think for me the dose makes the poison if I'm out for 20 minutes I'm gonna burn to a crisp you could probably hang all day in the Sun so that applies to many different things and I think even you know you can think about it to your soft skills as well your hard skills as well like patience I have a lot of patience the dose maybe is higher until it becomes poisonous there's a there's a threshold and an optimal dose so to speak and then you move into poison knowing when you hit poison on the things that you do and the things you embody to me is super critical and can really help you out so that that's one I also just love Heaven is an is a new pair of glasses like that's one of my favorite because it's just it grounds you to perspective when you're like holy [ __ ] the world's on fire this person just let this one's not showing up they drop the ball on that not that the team does this often but you know I'm being a little bit dramatic for uh for effect if you just put on a new pair of glasses so to speak and just re-contextualize the it really is like a pill it's like magic it goes from chaos to calm and then you can go in and execute and just take it with a smile dude I love it I I really love it um one of them I think it was what was your second what was your second one that you said fences made good neighbors fences make good neighbors reminds me of a book that I'm reading right now um so it's called Rocket Fuel the one essential combination that will get you more of what you want from your business by Gino Wickman have you heard about it so it basically talks about how successful businesses are built on the foundation of two people the Visionary and the integrator where you're the integrator actually and I'm the Visionary get outside Visionary the Visionary is the big picture person and the integrator is the one who makes things happen and it's basically This Confidential uh complementary relationship I'm I haven't finished it but I do have a few of the rules from that book that I want to share for people so the five rules for for the Visionary integrated relationship number one stay on the same page basically like regular alignment uh number two no end runs um so basically avoiding bypassing bypassing managers because that interferes in the relationship effectiveness of the relationship uh number three integrators break ties so this is about like delegation to the you know lowest person responsible uh integrator handling day-to-day issues between departments uh in the case of disagreement the integrator decides based on their awareness of priorities problems and resources so that's a great example we had a disagreement yesterday I was like I gave you my point of view but I was just like all right like you know you can you know the priorities and problems resources better so I also have a a different point of view than you do right number four working in versus on the business Visionary should focus on the company while integrators handle day-to-day operations and then finally number five maintain mutual respect so obviously there must be a high degree of trust that happens between Visionary and integrator spot on sounds like someone wrote the book on it and nailed it um funny I'm reading good to Great like we're both on our again this is like a perfect example we're both on our tracks of like leveling up and I think always helpful to reframe or at least kind of keep my feet grounded to to that and I have a lot to learn from you and I learn from you every week and as the Visionary I don't I I think for some companies it's not always clear who wears witch hat and I think for us it was clear from day one and it's made this really easy uh not to sound corny but this has never been hard even like our biggest disagreements don't last for more than a few minutes and then we move on as we like to say onwards with the rocket ship emoji and then we go and we've been doing that since literally 2020 is writing that saying after something happens I bet it happens that often but when it does and then we roll and so for me it's always yeah a matter of outside and inside and I think you're second to none at outside and I think I'm doing a decent job at inside and so I think together we are we're good pair man you and I 100 100 Let's uh we're out of time but let's let's end with one thing you hate about me and working with me because you spend a lot of time with me you think you want to end on a high note man now you want me to take you down take me down take me down I mean you know I want people to see that you know not all that Glitters Is gold right like and there's not a yeah I mean I'd love you know I'd love to hear my feedback session live feedback exactly my performance review roast me um okay I'll save the like nice one you know when people are like what's your greatest weakness I try too hard like I'll save that for the end and I'll no don't even don't give me that one I don't want that one okay that one save for after the Pod yeah actually don't even don't even I'm not even gonna tell you man I'm not even gonna tell you no you that one leaves with me um okay sometimes you go like gorilla CEO on us and just like go and have something executed on without really like waiting around or planning it and that's just because I'm the operator and so for me structure helps give me calm and peace what it does do is get [ __ ] done real quick and so I will give you like hats off to you when you do go gorilla CEO things get done but when you do go gorilla CEO sometimes it has Downstream effects on what we were working on the team Etc so that's one totally and then another one I don't know if I asked for one thing no I got another one I don't know if it's a superpower or or a weakness oftentimes the two are pretty uh out of juxtaposition for folks but once your mind is made up it's really hard to change it and I think it's a force that's not my mom so my mom told me as a kid I you know I was like that so I guess I guess people don't change I think they can again superpower probably sometimes I wouldn't say I Hate's a strong word sometimes it's a challenge all right I appreciate it listen it's a it's a it's an honor working with you on a day-to-day basis um likewise man I love it it's it's the best there's nothing I'd rather let's uh let's tell people I started off this pod by saying that you're criminally underfollowed and I couldn't agree like it's it's again it's criminal I use the word criminal and I don't mean it lightly where could people follow you on the internet to get more viewer theoisms sure two places right now maybe there'll be some video action in the future who knows LinkedIn and Twitter both at the otaba t-h-e-o-t-a-b-a-h I don't know about criminally underfollowed criminal and Theo I haven't been used in the same sentence in a long time but uh yeah I've got some cool stuff to say on culture Community operations and building businesses and uh onward yeah I think onward onward indeed and uh like LinkedIn specifically I think you're you've been really crushing it on so I'm just gonna highlight that one for for folks sure and uh if you like this episode please please please number one subscribe to the YouTube channel so I'm trying to get our YouTube numbers up and it's so hard it's like the hardest thing I've ever done so Theo can you tell can you tell people who are listening to get to YouTube and

people consume with their emotions and when you create stories it's able to get people involved emotionally that's what gets people to actually care about what you're doing the linear progression of a story which very well correlates to the narrative Arc of an actual Dorian some sort of intro which I call a hook that captivates the audience then there's setting then there's a conflict and then the conflict gets resolved and then there's a call to action a hook a setting a conflict a resolution and a call to action those are the five things that I try to incorporate in my videos

Overnight success doesn’t happen.
It takes time for the benefits of audience building to compound.
When you see someone who has achieved ‘overnight success’ the chances are:

1. Their audience aren’t that invested in them, and could move on to the next thing just as quickly.

2. They’ve actually been creating content and building community for a long time, and this is the moment that the benefits exploded for them.

the benefits especially of audience building is all going to be towards the end I wrote about it this last week Jack butcher who you had on recently on the show he obviously has that amazing visual it's just a straight line going nowhere and then it just kind of implodes the benefits really do accrue towards the end in so many ways too is like you're picking up more people but then the people you're picking up early on the journey they want to see you win and they're liking you more because of how much time they're spending with you

sort of wrote a few things down right before this but this is basically off the cuff so one Trend that I think is only going to continue and I saw actually a tweet by Alex Lieberman co-founder of morning Brew um that got me thinking about this so he says the four-step process of a Creator entrepreneur number one build buy a business number two create content about the process number three grow audience of people interested in the process number four reap benefits New Biz ideas New Biz to buy feedback on your businesses marketing Etc rinse and repeat and I think he's absolutely right I think creators are going to be creating a lot of new businesses and you know but there's one thing I think he's missing which is there's going to be less ads from creators and I think I'm an example of this so This podcast was making thirty thousand dollars of Revenue a month when my co-host and I sahil Bloom split up I was like I don't want to do ads so I removed all the ads and I went from thirty thousand dollars a month to zero I did it because number one I I didn't really want to be like honestly just like recording ads add spots like it didn't feel fun and I think that if you're gonna be in content Creation in some aspect like have fun with it so I didn't want to do that and then also I felt that I can build communities build products that I can just plug on the show here and people probably will go and check those out um so I I removed everything and it went from you know the people people say turn a cost center into a profit Center that's like the narrative right now on Twitter um the example that a lot of people use is AWS Amazon web services so servers was a cost Amazon ended up turning that into a product and now they sell that product and make billions of dollars a year of profit from it I did the complete opposite I took a something that I was making money and then I turned it into a cost but my thesis is that long term um it's going to outperform it's going to outperform and I think that you're are going to see a lot of creators and that was the only thing that was missing from Alex lieberman's um amazing tweet today which is I think you're going to see less ads from creators so that's a that's a trend that is only going to continue um okay next the most interesting product I've seen this week actually came from an Instagram ad it's called pair ring dot Co hair ring I'm just going to their website right now when you go to their website it's and by the way pear like the fruit p-e-a-r ring like a ring on you know a jewelry ring so when you go to their website you see the world's biggest social experiment it says single like single question mark introducing pair the in real life social experiment taking the World by storm live in US UK Germany Canada et cetera so it's basically a ring a physical ring that people wear to make it easy to know who else is single around um so it's a small quote-unquote a small subtle ring that makes a big statement so for it gives examples on the website like if you're in a bar you're on a train you're at the gym um it allows people to see that ring and instead you know instead of the dating fatigue that people are having this you know on on apps like Tinder Etc um they just see it and people can come up to each other and millions of people have joined it um it costs 25 and I'm not trying to like chill it I just think it's really interesting um because I I have a framework for thinking about building products and one of the Frameworks is how do you build the anti-incumbent so the incumbent here is Tinder like this is the complete opposite of Tinder hinge Rya all these dating dating apps literally a physical product that you pay for versus a free product like a Tinder or something like that um and I just think it's it's absolutely brilliant so that's just probably one of the cooler most interesting products that I've seen all week so check it out honestly it doesn't make a difference if you're if you're single or not it's just it's cool to see how um how to come up with a product that's going to get people talking um and I love how they call it like a social experiment they also have this thing called pear Fest which is the world's biggest singles Festival so they're just like they're doing cool very cool stuff and they and they literally sold out of their first release so something I'm quitting today so I posted on Twitter 11 days ago and I got 6 000 likes and I was like What if I asked chat gbt to basically get me to a million followers in 30 days okay so I'm trying something really crazy with chat gpt4 so I asked it your Tick-Tock gbt I am your human counterpart my name is Greg Eisenberg I talk about internet communities Ai and startups I have 442 Tick Tock followers and your only goal is to get me to 1 million Tick Tock followers in 30 days every day I'll ask you what to record the no record I will keep you updated with follower accounts and what people are liking don't let me down well I did it for 10 days today's the 11th day I learned a few things but one of the things I learned was the content was bad it was just like not interesting content um despite that I got you know just under 2 000 followers from from it from like that stunt I guess um but I'm not going to continue because and suddenly I'm quitting because I was just a I'm not having fun with it and then going back to what I was talking about earlier like if you're creating content you want to have fun with it and I'm not having fun with it because the content that chat GPT is outputting is just very very low quality and it doesn't mean I don't believe that chat gbt can come up with really great scripts um because I've actually used it uh to create script for videos that have been really high quality um I've used it to create content that's been really high quality but it's actually the way I set up this particular experiment which is like I'm just the liaison between Chad gbt and like I'm relying on people to like comment and then I feed it chat gbt and it's just it's just not working and I'm not having fun with it so lesson learned you can't leave chat GPT on its own to create content you have to um like if you want to create incredible content it needs to be AI enhanced it can be AI driven just yet although with uh agent GPT and the autonomous stuff that's coming out coming out I think that might change but for right now if you're watching this right now or listening to this right now um you can't really rely on AI to to basically just like hey create a script and not give it feedback it is very much an iterative approach with it um tool I've been playing with this week summarize.tech so if you're anything like me you love watching YouTube videos um and if you and if you don't uh if you don't watch YouTube honestly watch YouTube it's like there's so much incredible content out there that you can be learning from and I actually find like for me personally like if I watch the content versus listen to it it um it sticks in my brain uh a little bit more so I do watch a lot of YouTube and this tool I've been using uh this week has been called summarize.tech and if you go to summarize.tech it's a free tool it says get a summary of any long YouTube video like a lecture live event or government meeting powered by chat GPT and it's all timestamp too it's like pretty ugly UI and pretty ugly I mean pretty ugly design but it's it's really really high quality stuff you can there's a few ways I've been using this one is if I'm not sure if I want to like that here you know dedicate an hour like here episode 95 of the all in podcast I might not want to watch it for an hour but I might be interested like some all-ins I like some all-ins I don't like or just less interesting to me so I put in to summarize.tech I can read the summary and then it goes like here I'm reading this one um they're discussing the passing of Queen Elizabeth II and Elizabeth the second was the symbol of service I'm like ah do I really care about this like I don't know if I really want to spend an hour of my life watching this so that's one way you could um use summarize attack the other way is if you're creating content um either on Twitter or on a blog or on your sub stack uh or even on like website copy little you know you want to create compelling content it it just helps to like speed up the process for learning about stuff right so you might not have time to listen to six one hour YouTube videos but you might be able to just read the summary or listen to different parts of it so this has been a really fun one to play with this week summarize.tech okay story I was reminded of so there's I'll tell you a story I was reminded of um because I had like a Facebook memory so 2014 I in 2013 I sold a company to a social network called semopon in 2014 one of our board members Ram charam it basically became like in my like Mentor in a lot of ways he he was like a he's a Silicon Valley OG he was on the board of Google he put some of the first dollars into Google he is a billionaire and he invited me to his Christmas holiday party and uh he told me he's like there's gonna be incredible people there yeah it'll be good for you to be there as a representative from StumbleUpon like there's a lot of people you should know there um he's like get there get there on time so I get there you know I think it was called for 6 P.M I get to his house in Woodside Cal no it was an Atherton Atherton California I think it's the highest median uh net worth in America if not the second and I walk into this incredible house and I think there's like picassos on the wall and crazy art and this huge tent outside and they're serving you know high-end wine and stuff like that and I get there and there's only like I get there on time because he told me to get there on time and there's only like 10 people there seven people there in this massive space for like a thousand people so um I end up grabbing one of these expensive glasses of wine I end up seeing these this older couple probably in their 80s and they started talking to them 30 minutes 45 minutes an hour you know used the the father was telling me he worked at Stanford and he was a professor and he was telling me about physics and the wife was also in you know really interested in education and and uh so just like we talked about all sorts of different things and before I knew it I had spent like 90 minutes talking to this older couple and I was missing my chance I was like missing my chance to uh take advantage of meeting like all these people like Mark benioff was there Marissa Mayer was there all these like big shot people I start getting nervous actually I think she she the the grandmother she I think she was like are you are you okay and I was like oh you know I should go like meet people here and she goes oh I have someone to introduce you to you said you're into videos right and at the time I was you know the company I sold to stumble upon was a video discovery app built on top of YouTube I was like yeah yeah she's like I want to introduce you to my daughter her name is Susan wachitzki she's the CEO of YouTube and I was like oh my God so she pulls me over to the other side of the room introduces me to her daughter which is like way better than going up to a stranger and being hi Susan like someone like that hi Susan like I'd love to introduce you myself no her mom was like Hey her mom and dad were like you gotta meet you've got to meet Greg he's awesome I told her about our app five buy she had it on her phone it was incredible and a lot of amazing things came from that and the lesson I have this the sort of lessons I have from that story I was reminded of because of this Facebook memory is that um if there's going to be a lot of important people at a party get there on time and speak to anyone you never know who those people are so good memory and wanted to share that one with you all um a concept I'm thinking about right now so one thing I'm thinking about it's actually not so much of a concept it's almost like a philosophy a business philosophy which is how do you think about Focus so I run a a product studio and in our product Studio we have a family of agencies that we were on um you know boringmarketing.com or dispatch.latecheckout.studio our design subscription or late checkout our Innovation agency about all these agencies we've got communities we run you probably need a robot.com etc etc and then product we're building right so we're doing all these different things we have different leaders in our company who run run these different divisions I've been thinking a lot about you know because I've been running this for three years and I've been thinking a lot about how do you know when to focus the hard part about running a product studio is you can do anything right you come up with an idea and you can do anything and I think you know to Alex lieberman's uh tweet uh Point like to his point like these creators who are going to create products like they're going to create tons of product and I'm I'm just trying to something I'm I'm thinking about is how much focus should you give to each product is there a point where you're you're not focused enough and I think that's the reason why a lot of uh product Studios have failed in the past they've failed in the past because they've focused on too many things they spread too thin they quit the products too late or too early um and we've made those mistakes uh over the last three years in a lot of ways and um the way I'm thinking about it now is I want to be a bit more focused and like we've got all these bets in these different categories be it design or SEO with boring or Ai and stuff like that and um I'd want to go deeper not wider um and I think a lot of you know a lot of people are going to make a mistake around they're gonna go I think the mistake that people make is they either go too wide or too narrow the only focus focus on this one idea or they're focused on 10 ideas and it's too much so just something I'm thinking about and wanted to share with you all okay the biggest productivity gain I've had recently so the biggest productivity gain I've had recently was Dremel please deleting Twitter off my phone I deleted Twitter off my phone and the quality of my life has skyrocketed and this is coming from a guy who absolutely loves Twitter and and that's why it's such a quality of life increase it's a quality of life increase because I'd be waiting in line for coffee during these like Gap times or going for a walk and just subconsciously checking my phone it got to a point where I was just checking it way too much and I know a lot of people listening here have this problem too right like and and it might not be Twitter for you it might be Instagram or Tick Tock or whatever and I can tell you how incredible it feels to just delete these apps from your phone and when you want to actually go and consume this content go and consume the content on desktop and do it in like particular times right oh I'm gonna you know now I don't feel guilty when I'm on Twitter and I'm like I'm gonna you know every morning it's been 30 minutes on Twitter enjoy it write tweets react to people reply to people see what's going on so yeah not people not enough people talking about what a productivity unlock that uh the leading Twitter or social media apps where your phone is and I think I'll end this this version of the where it happens random show with a bit of a regret I've had um it's really two regrets so one is I only started posting on my sub stack or newsletter weekly in like this year 2023. so now I send out a Weekly Newsletter if you want to subscribe they checkout.substack.com uh and I I'm absolutely loving it well first of all I'm just like enjoying doing it it's really fun to write the impact it's had on on our businesses has been multiple seven Figures it's incredible so it's just like a reminder and a regret that I should have been doing this for years and I know you're probably listening this too and you're like you might not be writing weekly um but I feel like we all could write something weekly um I'm very inspired by Seth Godin Seth Godin writes daily and he has been writing daily for like over a decade he's got like an incredible blog check it out Seth Godin like Google set golden blog and sometimes they'll just like literally post like a tweet size insight and he's probably just if I had to guess he's probably like scheduling those right he's not writing it in the moment but I think now with like schedulers with having chat gbt as your editor for grammar and stuff like that and ideation like there really is no excuse for writing at some consistent basis maybe it doesn't need to be daily maybe it doesn't even need to be weekly but even monthly like start a blog write monthly um put put yourself out there and the results like will that will shock you they've shocked me the other thing I also wish I had done is in my other regret is um right on Twitter multiple times a week like three four five times a week you know I've been on Twitter since I think 2006 and I would tweet but I wouldn't tweet like as much as I Tweet now yeah in the last 28 days I had 45.5 million impressions on my tweets that's like bigger than the size of Canada bigger than California and and I built this audience starting in 2020 you know it's all it it really hasn't been that long so you could do a similar thing in three years reach 45 million people every single month and all that's required is is just coming up with ideas editing those ideas being you know and just putting it out there and seeing what stacks and find finding your lane and finding your Niche so my only regret is I wonder if I would have started in 2000 whatever 2007 2008 you know what would my would my audience be a lot bigger and you know I never stop I I didn't start collecting emails until 2020 so this is just it was just a regret I had and I'm happy I caught it early and definitely something to think about uh for for everyone um go and write um and I think you'll enjoy it so yeah this ends this episode of the random show and where it happens I hope you enjoyed it this is what's on my mind right now you are inside the brain of Greg Eisenberg and if you liked it share this episode with a friend and share it online and subscribe to our YouTube channel and um like I said we have no I have no ads I'm not there's no Wii I I there's no ads and uh so I'm doing this you know partially for me because I I think it's it's fun to do but uh and also I think it's hopefully people enjoy it so um let me know if you do it's been real later

what you start to realize is that all these people that exist they may be 90 years old or they may be 17 years old they have something to teach you and if you can simply just ask a set of questions that allows you to derive some some value and input from that they really like talking about this too these non-obvious mentors they don't have a lot of people asking them for their time in fact I've enjoyed this so much that I've recently put together this project called Big Shot which is me sitting down with these non-obvious but you realize as you meet these people how much they have to teach and how no one has heard their stories and so non-obvious mentors actually have a non-obvious amount of alpha in terms of teaching and insight and impact that you can derive if you simply ask them about it

[Music] welcoming Nick Sharma to the show [Music] pretty excited to have you here dude I can't believe it's taken this long it's all your fault for the record is not my fault you are a busy busy guy but I'm happy you're here whenever I want a perspective on anything d2c related Nick is my boy I look forward to his Sunday emails where he he sheds a lot of knowledge and I just wanted to spend an hour talking about d2c let's do it so let's just start with what's exciting you in D to see land nowadays like you could be doing anything yet you have been doing d2c for like a decade now why are you still in it and what's exciting I was just joking with somebody before this that uh once I'm done with this chapter I'm going straight boring B2B software like I'm going I want I want to make air traffic control one percent more efficient or in the back of an ambulance some machine one percent more efficient some contract that locks in for 50 years and takes a year to close why is it just because g2c is so difficult that you're kind of like should I do something more it's not that it's difficult I think it's uh in fact I think d2c is actually very sort of straightforward but the the thing is is you have to be really good at being agile agile with how you respond to things that happen in the d2c world um for example you know tracking changes the ability of how tracking gets fed back to a platform changes or there's a new law or a new algorithm in Search and that completely changes or you know there's a new algorithm from a social network that you were super reliant on for distribution and um in all of these changes there is a very clear okay this is the change which means this is what's going to happen which means this is what we need to do to react and respond but a lot of people don't go to the third piece and or they don't they see it but they don't accept it this happens a lot too with like brands that launch that um you know they have the hardest time going from zero to one and it's not necessarily because they're doing anything super wrong but it's like the idea just sucks you know like nobody wants adaptogen infused hummus for example I'm just making this up but like somebody is going to keep fighting for a year or two years spending their whole life you know trying to make this thing within that two years trying to make it a reality but it's like it's not even wanted by the market so you know in that case I think d2c is very simple it's like well it's either going to work or it's not going to work you're either going to fit into something that will sell and do well and of course there's ways to test that or you're not but trying to fight an uphill battle and then blame it on something else I think is like the lazy way out how do you know if you're walking up an uphill mountain or if you're just just just like almost at the top you know Seth Godin I think calls it calls it the dip you know knowing like you've run your clock up yeah I mean sometimes you know I mean there's so many stories of of entrepreneurs who've created products who you know it's like they have a week left of cash and then like at the end they like figure it out like you know Nikita beer for example um you know TBH that app that he eventually sold to Facebook like was like I mean I remember him calling me and being like hey dude like do you know how to shut down an office and shut down a company and I was like whatever happened to that app that you were gonna launch tbh and he was like I don't know yeah we might just launch and see what happens like he was about to quit but he still pressed submit yeah I think that's different I think that's a little different in the sense that um he's basically you know he's actually doing the opposite of what I was talking about this what I'm talking about is like you know his version of adaptogen infused hummus was like the product that didn't work and one option um one option would have been like just keep trying to figure out how to make it work keep spending every last dollar on ads to drive people there or convincing people to turn it on but you know I think what he did is what most people should do which is the pivot of okay this doesn't work let's take the learnings of what what did work in this process and it might it might have nothing to do with the idea of what was launched but it might be that oh we found a great packaging vendor here that got us good pricing we found a great flavor house that developed good flavors for us and then figure out what the next step ad is there's two ways to come up with an idea for a d2c product one is like you walk into the grocery store and you're like wow I wish this product would exist oh it doesn't I'm gonna go and create it and then there's another way which is I'm gonna like look at Trends and competitive analysis and a bunch of other ways to figure out if there's a market need which way do you recommend going and yeah just share some light on that I think it depends where your strength is so a lot of Founders Who start these businesses um you know like very little uh a small percentage of people actually raise money I'd imagine a lot of people who listen to this probably bootstrap or maybe you've raised a very small round but you know very few people raise 10 20 30 million dollars to build a business and as a result like if you're starting a direct to Consumer brand or a cpg brand or retail brand you sort of have to understand what you're good at are you good at branding are you good at storytelling are you good at sourcing are you good at Financial operations and cash flow management uh or are you good at like Performance Marketing are you really good at you know the creative side the business side the analytics side and um I think depending on what you're good at you will find one of these paths to discover what that product is somebody who has mass distribution can take the first route of walking into the grocery store and saying damn I wish I had a chocolate bar with four ingredients in it six ingredients in it and then you know you're you're competing with the biggest companies in the world um you know you're basically neck and neck against Hershey's and Mondelez and all these other companies uh that would not work for the average person who's bootstrapped and starting but it does work for somebody who has a ton of distribution already built in on the flip side something like Jolie which is a shower head filtered shower head the the uh the value prop is not really in the distribution but it's in the innovation of the product itself and so somebody who is more focused around branding or marketing or um even like you know sourcing can win at that game better than maybe somebody who just has a bunch of followers and is coming to bring something so I think it kind of depends I mean generally I would say like both could do either one they want um I think one thing I've learned too is working with brands at a very early stage you have to have some sort of a moat something that will get you from zero to ten very clearly um whether that is a a very good understanding of the market you know you see a clear open space whether that's the ability to go launch into retail off the bat whether that is the fact that you know black wolf nation is a men's skin care brand they own their own fulfillment center from the get-go they save tons of money there and they were able to you know do tons of things around merchandising and upselling products because they could and so I think yeah I think a lot of people arrive to it different conclusions or in different ways sometimes it's frustrations that somebody has on their own sometimes it's um you know something that they're just passionate about and then sometimes like you know there's a lot of businesses a lot of the earlier e-commerce businesses were started by like Finance guys who just said oh there's a clear Market hole right here here I'm gonna go build a product it's going to cost this much we're going to sell it for three times that there's a clear Market opportunity there's demand for it and um you know we're going to run Facebook ads um are the first uh examples of all these big d2c companies like the Casper's of the world like are they not failures like they all kind of their failures in the sense they like they became billion dollar companies they raised a ton of money and now when you look at them on public comps either they're because you know become private in the case of Casper I think Casper was privatized or a lot of these d2c companies have like market caps in like the 50 to 200 million dollar range where they've raised like half a billion or more yeah I mean uh Wall Street uh hates e-commerce retail or not retail but e-commerce and you know basically like Brands generally uh they hate a lot of the new brands like all birds is down 95 in the public markets you know Honest Company I think think trades at less than half of their revenue you know I don't think that wall Street's Judgment of a lot of these companies is an accurate representation of how these businesses could be run a lot of the businesses were also run you know like uh operationally they weren't that efficient um and you know to their credit like they were the first ones doing it you know Casper was the first company to put a mattress in a box and figure out how to sell it online and build that behavior if Casper didn't exist like whoever the next company was that did it they would have had the hardest time and you know ended up in the same position I remember sitting in New York City at a restaurant with co-founder of Casper and maybe 2011 or 2012 and he told me that he had just graduated basically like mattress science and I was like that's a thing at first of all I was like that's actually a thing like I didn't know like I'm from Canada I don't know I don't know like we don't have that up there you know like yeah that was the first and then he was like my idea is like I'm gonna you know and I create a prototype I created a mattress in a box and I just remember thinking to myself like this guy's crazy a mattress in a box it's impossible that that's not how this works and so you're right like we got to give them Credit in the sense of like they took big leaps yeah big leaps and you know Casper is a great example of uh you know Casper walked so everybody else could run like Casper Casper figured out everything that didn't work so the following companies could you know I think most mattress companies now that exist on the market they don't actually have inventory that they own they're all Drop Shipping on demand and so right away it's like you know that was something that Casper didn't figure out early enough that they did you know Casper had the beautiful big office in New York City and Soho turns out you don't need a big office with 75 people to sell you know e-commerce products um so I think even though like a lot of people would say that there are failures and I do think to some extent there were mess-ups like you know there's definitely Founders who took tons of secondary or you know took a ton of money off the table and then you know when layoffs come around they're sitting high and pretty with millions of dollars in their account and their employees have to go figure out how they're going to pay rent the next month I think that's pretty messed up but I do think they a lot of these early companies don't get enough credit for like Paving the way for um for the behavior of e-commerce that they created and instilled in consumers that exist today so if you were running Casper or The Honest Company like pick a company what would Nick Sharma do uh so if I was running The Honest Company I think right away I would um figure out what products to cut like I think I think some some of these brands that exist they they sell way too many things and they don't focus on something so they're not known for one thing honest companies like known for what good honest ingredients but you know does do they really need to have a beauty line and wipes and cleaning products and bath and body and baby products like probably not in fact I would imagine that you know two of these categories do really well for them and the other six just completely you know they're just they just exist so I would probably do that I think from a tech standpoint uh there's a ton of these early Brands honest included which operate on a technology infrastructure that was great 10 years ago but is not modernized and up to speed with what consumers are looking for today um I think just between those two things you could probably shave a ton off the bottom line and then of course like you know going into their customer acquisition and their customer retention and understanding their lifetime value of customers there's probably so many little things you could tweak uh that would turn the business and go up and to the right like you know whoever Runs The Honest Company site like they should be fired and unemployable in my opinion okay so if you were bringing you know it doesn't look like honest companies on Shopify like if you were bringing them on Shopify let's say um what you know what sort of d2c Nick Sharma prove stack would you propose um I mean I'd bring them to Shopify plus almost immediately um I would probably swap their subscription system to a company called stay which is really like a retention tool that also does subscription um you know they use things like hot jar which is you know expensive and old um it looks like they've got clavio which looks good explain what that is like what's clavio yeah so clavio is uh ESP email service provider think like MailChimp um you know MailChimp is probably the easiest comp for it but it's like an email platform for e-commerce businesses um you know I think like right away just moving them to Shopify would actually probably bump up their bottom line a good amount um just because of the inefficiencies that come with using Salesforce Commerce Cloud which is what they currently use um I would probably install a ton of apps from subscription to analytics to proper upsells to uh you know a proper review system um a referral program you know things making things easy like build your own bundle right now they have it but it's very clunky and the ux is really bad um and you know then I would start like tweaking and optimizing you know I'd figure out what does it take to get a new uh customer in the door a new subscriber in the door and I'd build landing pages around that I'd try to figure out um you know I Have This Acronym called the trace uh system which is like you know how do you Align Technology reporting audiences creative and the site experience that somebody goes to to try to build customer funnels that you can rely on X number of customers coming in every day new customers for the brand at a sustainable pace so yeah I think you know once once you make like the big tweaks like moving them to Shopify making the ux a lot simpler you know for example like their diapers cost thirteen dollars and it very it doesn't even tell you how many diapers come in the in the pack uh once you make all these like obvious things that they should be doing or whoever is in charge should be fired for then I would focus on the one percent improvements across the board so how do you increase the email capture rate by one percent how do you increase the cart click-through rate by one percent how do you increase the upt and the aov upt as units per transaction or items in your basket and aov is average order value how do you increase that by one percent every day um and then it just becomes a game of like chipping at it until you know it gets to a point where it makes a lot of sense okay let's let's let's continue on this thread of Nick sharma's honest reviews of d2c companies what's this is going to get me in trouble no okay well we'll take the other side of the spectrum what's a what's a d2c company that's doing a really good job and and why are they doing a good job um all right here's one that I think is doing a really good job um simple straight to the point I'm gonna drop it in the chat for you it's a brand called Cadence um they are they're basically these beautiful little travel capsules made of recycled plastic you know these guys they haven't raised an absorbent amount of money very little cash they're profitable on every purchase they have a healthy margin baked into their product they produce their own product which also helps with that they fulfill their own product which also helps with that and um they're very good at showing you the light at the end of the tunnel from a marketing standpoint and how you're going to get to the light at the end of the tunnel um and then you know tactically if you go to their site their photography is next level beautiful their use of product renders also very beautiful the way that they incorporate existing customers into their sales process to sell new customers fantastic their site experience in terms of understanding what you're getting how many you're getting why you're paying what you're paying what the benefit of having these are and what the alternative is for not using this product also very on point this is I think going to be a very clear 100 million dollar brand very soon the the photography is I'm just noticing this the photography is drop dead gorgeous it's like absolutely stunning the other thing I'm noticing is there's actually probably about 20 to 30 percent of video on on screen um ends up being Auto played but it's it's really helping me understand like what this product is and why why I should want it like sometimes I'll you know go on some e-commerce sites and I'll see video and it feels just like it feels like someone feels like they listen to a podcast and someone was like put video on your Ecommerce page and they did versus this is like really integrated into the experience yeah you'll also notice too like with all this video there's no lag and or no yeah there's no lag and load time or or slow down Insight speed as a result they also have this cool feature called text for 25 I assume that they're getting people's obviously uh phone number capture there uh which is pretty smart I haven't seen that like creating an SMS relationship are you seeing more more of that nowadays yeah definitely more on SMS um yeah I mean SMS is like it's it's generally a very hard thing to get the conversion rate of grabbing somebody's phone number is um you know probably half if not lower for most brands than what it is to grab email and also then you know the follow-up to that is how good is a brand at actually using that channel and sending things that are you know not coming off as spammy um but yeah SMS is definitely something that you know I I think it's like every every brand wants to have somebody's phone number you know because your open rates nearly 100 maybe 99 um and your click-through rates way higher your Revenue percent in general your Revenue per recipient that you send to for SMS is usually significantly higher than if you were to comp the same Revenue per recipient on email but a lot of people don't know how to use that channel in a way where it's like not annoying or it comes or it doesn't um you know like a lot of people don't know how to bring value through SMS as their brand and so that you know then it separates the ones that are good I can't think of any brand that brings value through SMS to me like to me it's always is annoying give me an example of how you can integrate SMS in a way that is respectful to the channel I.E it's a very intimate channel uh it's reserved for friends and family um yeah what's an example of something that you've seen or if you you know if you're uh Cadence like what would you do to integrate SMS well I think the one thing that I think about with uh email and SMS and really anything tied back to retention marketing is your goal is not you know there's like if you think of your goal as a con or your your um your outcome as like a a two or three step approach or or like a bus ride let's do a bus ride it's got three stops on the bus you get on the bus the first stop is actually just excitement and good content it's something that gets somebody thinking that as they're running out of their cases of hint water you know they get something fun exciting cute quirky funny um you know interesting insightful from the brand and it's not selling them on anything it's just good content and they see oh this was from hint oh actually I think I'm running low on hint I should reorder and it's just about getting mind share to beasts it you know like to be the uh top five or a top ten thought in somebody's head at any given point that's like stop one on the on the retention bus then I think stop two is understanding okay does this person actually need to re-up or do they need to know at this point do they need to see our brand again from a sales standpoint um you know this is where a lot of companies that sell consumables uh don't properly segment their list and so let's say you sell deodorant and somebody's on a deodorant subscription well if they're on a deodorant subscription they actually don't need to see that you're running a sale because you don't want them to unsubscribe and now buy from the sale and now you've lost somebody who would have stayed another eight months or you know three quarters and then the third part the third stop I think is actually sending that message and when you send that message it has to be sent in a way where it feels like it was written just for you quick Interruption from me if you're listening to this on Apple podcast or Spotify or getting any value you need to come to YouTube and subscribe to the where it happens podcast YouTube channel I promise you the experience is richer more interesting so if you're getting any value just stop what you're doing open up the YouTube app go to the website and press subscribe at where it happens on YouTube and if you're watching this on YouTube and you haven't subscribed what are you doing go go press subscribe thank you enjoy the rest of the show so a lot of people they they fill out the SMS piece as they're doing the email piece they're generally grouped together in a media plan or in a promotional plan and um that's where I think it goes wrong it's written from this promotional POV like you know somebody's writing a 15 off email they write the 15 off text whereas uh if I were writing a text I would say okay who is a friend that I have that embodies the customer that we're going after so we have this girl in our office named Carly she's like the customer for every client we work with and so you know if I were writing a text I would say okay now how would I text Carly that we're running a sale for 15 off and that's exactly what I would then you know I'd remove her name Carly and replace it with bracket first name and put that in and and let it blast off but the the real like I think sauce comes in one there's a lot of retention marketers that don't rely on good content or it's like folk it's too focused on sales it's not focused on like you know it's like hey let's go let's go uh let's go to my bedroom instead of yeah let's go to dinner first and grab a couple drinks um and then the second one is the the Miss of segmentation you know like every almost every SMS or email tool you use today has the ability to segment customers based on products they bought when they bought what type of even like shade of the color they bought um but it's obviously just easier to ignore that and send the text out to everybody I'm wondering if uh there's there's an opportunity to create like a Carly AI bot where 100 right how do we do that how do we do that no I think I'm curious if you thought much about how to use AI to personalize communication but it feels like that's kind of where things are going like if you're able to upload data about someone's habits how they talk where they live demographic data and then basically speak to them in a way that they really want to be spoken to I I'd pay for that service so for something like that actually you're the perfect person to ask I've had this question on my mind for so long so let's say I wanted to build Carly bot and it was like you know I I train you know in theory I train this bot on who the customer is uh what we're selling why they're buying you know the common objections or pain points they have before making a purchase like where do I even start to do that well I think so the key question is do you actually have that data so first the Assumption let's just assume that you have that data okay so which isn't necessarily going to be true right so I think there's that's actually where I think um some of the bigger retailers and and e-commerce players like the Amazons of the world have so much more data that they actually have an unfair advantage if they want to go down this route because you could get into a situation where you know your car they bought operates at 50 but Amazon's car they bought operates at 100 or 97 percent and that's actually we can talk about that later but that's where it gets kind of scary that as we enter this AI age there's an unfair Advantage for the large players not the small for sure-ups whereas in the pre like where it's been previous like as we've grown up it's always been in the startups that have been more agile but yeah so you have this data and you know you you'd have to well I I just actually just tweeted about this today there's something have you heard of Auto GPT no so um Auto GPT is new so you don't don't feel like you're behind or anything like that I already feel like I'm buying um and you know one of the the big problems right now with chat GPT is number one it's not connected to the internet number two it doesn't have much memory in terms of it doesn't remember a lot and number three it can't operate in real time the problem if you were just to build Carly bot on a um you know chat GPT type playground the problem is it's what if you responded to it right like you know and the memory wasn't very deep or what if you you know it's it's very hard for chat gbt to make real-time decisions based on how things are changing so an auto GPT does is you know let's just say the example is a customer service representative and auto GPT can understand customer inquiries Provide support suggest upsells and it could also speak literally speak in any language possible 24 7. so you can actually have it like you can be texting with it Carly bought and it responds in a voice note wow like that's that's why you know not enough people are talking about Auto GPT in my opinion but like is that so like tactically how would I set that up do I just go and start talking to it like hey I'm gonna feed you information yeah yeah there's like you go into GitHub like there's a reason why the number one GitHub repo right now and project right now is auto GPT over the last week because people are downloading it and playing with it and they're trying to figure out okay I want to make a customer service bot I want to make a social media management bot I want to make whatever bot but I wanted to act in real time I want to connect it to the internet and I wanted to have uh strong memory management and I also wanted to have text to voice that's insane I got to play so so you could like do I need to know how to code yeah yeah and you know yes yes like I think you know even downloading a GitHub repo without really understanding how to code is difficult right um that being said like I think that people actually underestimate how cheap it is to actually prototype some of these use cases and someone like you like you actually have a lot of data because you know through Sharma Brands like your agency and through you know hooks you know your landing page product you you just you understand a lot of um different segments right so there's a way for you to basically like if I were you I'd like contact a lot of my clients and be like hey I want to create this thing I want to create this Carly bot I'm gonna give it to you for free um the catch is I want some of your data you can go and create a prototype for probably relatively cheap and see if it works yeah I think the cool thing about Ai and your space like an Ecom is it's gonna do two things it's gonna drastically reduce the costs for for just owning and operating it for example yesterday we were talking to you know we have a an AI and automation agency called you probably need a robot.com and we were talking to this company that spends three hundred thousand dollars a month on customer service reps and what we modeled out is that using AI you can actually get that to twenty five thousand dollars a month interesting do you still have like a you know a management layer but so number one it's a cost savings and number two um arguably customer service is an example like the user experience for most people is pretty bad so arguably if the AI if Carly bot is good enough it's a better experience because there's no waiting times like there's literally no waiting times imagine customer service is no waiting times yeah man all this stuff is so fascinating I feel like the biggest Gap I have is what I mentioned here which is like the process of okay I have this idea to do like an on-site chat bot or a customer service bot or um a Carly bot for you know writing up SMS messages and then making the actual like application that goes live that Gap in between is the part I don't understand and don't even know where to start outside downloading some GitHub repo if I came to you and I was like hey I really want to create a d2c product and I wanted to hire charmer Brands to do it like you would be like very oh you got to do these 100 things like you've rattled off 45 products in this 30 Minute Podcast so far right like that it's second nature to you right right but like that there's a similar stack that exists in AI that you can leverage you know people have been people act like AI is like fresh in 2023 like people have been building an AI for a decade it's only like recently that there's been like huge consumer ux new products like chat GPT that have come out so my point here is that it might seem daunting but once you actually get into the weeds it's actually a lot less daunting than you think the the customer service application is really interesting there's a company that exists called certainly have you heard of this yeah tell people what certainly is certainly is like a chatbot you can train so uh you know one example here is like when feastable is launched we had I think um 16 customer service agents fully trained up and ready to go and we came across this company certainly that we wanted to layer in into the customer service stack it would live on the site as a chatbot and we could basically train it it's called feastybot on uh on the website you could train it to basically understand the brand speak like the brand the tone of voice teach it how to answer questions and this bot eliminated 96 of customer inbound inquiries um and you know the customer service stack went from like 14 to 2 at the time I think now it's maybe double that but it was crazy how much money it just saved in human capital human resources and also just time yeah and I I I'm just on their website now like I love their their tagline which is create a digital twin of your best sales person yeah that's a great tagline right because that's like really what they're trying to do so when you see a company like this do you think oh these guys are screwed as soon as chat gbt gets to you know somebody else's hands or or are they like you know they have something here about certainly in chat GPT or is that just because you know people like me have now played with AI through chat GPT and like that's the the best way to cast the wide net of bringing me into their funnel if I'm like the CEO certainly am I getting eight hours of sleep absolutely not am I getting three hours of sleep no absolutely not am I getting five to six hours of sleep yes so I'm basically like I I'm definitely weary that I could lose to a chat GPT plug-in uh or shop you know maybe even Shopify competes directly but if I'm certainly the number one thing I'm focusing on is how do I make the ux for the end user like the most high quality experience possible that I'm light years ahead of whatever anyone's gonna create on you know competing platform because feastables will continue to use certainly if uh the end consumer is having a good experience you know what what feasibles doesn't want to do is like get like a cheaper solution that even might have better AI models and has been even trained better but the actual core experience that people are using to have these personalized conversations is worse than my take is that they're still they'll they'll retain it certainly interesting and I guess if certainly can continue to take their like data exhaust and turn it back into more proprietary info for them to make the conversations better more efficient faster Etc then that is kind of how they'll stay ahead of the curve totally and it's a bit of a land grab for them like if I'm them I'm trying to raise as much money as possible right so I can hire my real my real sales people to call up Procter and Gamble and some of these larger companies yeah and and get them to sign up with me even if it's for 12 months or six months or 18 months and get that data in I think certainly is a real business like I would love to I would have loved to invest in this company um all right let's do another honest a Nick Sharma honest review talk to me about a creator-led d2c example that you think is high quality I'm gonna go with rare Beauty which is Selena Gomez's um beauty company I like this company for a few reasons one I think Selena Gomez is just badass um second is the way that she decided to build this company was like how DJ Khaled puts albums together she basically just found the opportunity and then brought all the pieces together she brought the CEO together the CMO Etc um the other thing is she innovated around the packaging and the way that they merchandise products so they have these like Minis that they sell in Sephora and online which gets them well I should say the minis plus the fact that she is Selena Gomez and has this Mass audience and distribution that she does not pay for that allows her to sell products that aren't you know super expensive and where she can still make money which allows her to make these minis which allows her to drive way more sampling than you know maybe any other Beauty brand in the category so this is a brand that I think you know they mainly sell online for Sephora as well which does pretty well for them from what I could tell they're very much a come sit with us type of brand versus a you have to try to get into our you know tree house or whatever and I think they're very smart about how they go about building the brand you know this is a brand that could be successful um even after an acquisition and Selena is no longer involved whereas you know you think of other some other celebrity brands that exist in the beauty category you know their name is in the product itself and it makes it very hard to separate post acquisition or you know long term rarebeauty.com versus honest.com the first thing I notice is how different the nav bar is when when I was on honest.com it was like a thousand call to actions on the nav bar like there's just like a lot going on when I go to rare Beauty there's literally three tabs so you can shop there's a shade finder which I'd love you to talk about actually I'd like you to talk about shade finder and rare impact both those tabs because I find them both quite interesting yeah so um you know the the simpler the nav bar is the better it is uh generally in e-commerce you want to make things easier from a ux perspective versus make them harder you know when you land and you see this site above the fold meaning you don't have to scroll it's just whatever you see in your window you want this to feel like you just walked into a store in SoHo or in on Fifth Ave and then as you go through and see things for example you saw the shop the shade finder and the rare impact you want to almost like limit the options to guide them through the store so if you go into a store on Fifth Ave you know somebody looks at you and says all right I know exactly where to take this person in the store that's sort of what a navbar here does whereas like in the honest example you know there's probably like a hundred to 150 options of what you could click as soon as you hit the home page and look above the fold there's things that are changing scrolling side to side it's kind of hard to know where to look whereas here it's very clear you land you've got a hero product right in the middle and then if that's not what you want your best sellers is there above the fold so you can always just go right there or you just hover over shop and you can immediately choose if you want to shop all the products if you want to see just what's new because maybe you came to the site knowing that there's something new out if you're new to the brand you might go to Best Sellers and if you're a bit you know if you're not new to the brand but you know what you want you don't want to go to shop all you just choose between face or eye or lip and so I think this is merchandised super well for the type of traffic they get you have to remember too with celebrity or Creator Brands they get a shitload of traffic traffic that they didn't pay for traffic that they didn't send and so you know because of that you have to really focus on how you merchandise and bring somebody through the store um now they probably tested into both of the share find shade finder and the rare impact being on top given who her audience is and what they're interested in um you know they probably realize that the rare impact fund which is actually a real fund that they have that they contribute to is um something that matters to them and something that matters to Their audience quite a bit and you know generally when you have some sort of a you know like what's what sets apart Selena Gomez's brand from the next the next uh product on on the Sephora shelf selling blush or bronzer well it's the fact that like I now know that when I buy the lip oil or the bronzer stick that I'm also contributing to something good and you know that's what separates products from Brands is what keeps you coming back and what and especially in the beauty category where loyalty to a brand is so low I think it's only something like 14 of consumers will stay with a brand they'll still try other things but you know the brand part comes in when you have things like an impact fund or uh you know it could be as lucrative as an impact fund it could be as simple as like surprise and delight and really good text messages from the Carly bot the shade Finder 2 is something else that does really well in Beauty it just helps feel you know it's it's like the the concept of personalization is alive here and it's uh working it's not truly personalized because there's not that many levels of how deep this goes but it's a very simple way to add that touch and feel of personalization where somebody feels like they're now being heard or being recognized for in this case their color of their skin and making sure that there's products that match that also it just probably helps from a customer service standpoint of making sure that there's less returns because somebody's color that they bought is more you know connected to the actual color of their skin would you ever start a d2c company or do you prefer supporting the industry uh for sure start a d2c company like they're you know I think from a standpoint of opportunity there is no better time to start a d2c company think about how easy it is now to use openai's chat GPT and just build a module for something like if we need something and a developer is unavailable we can just go to open Ai and it'll write the code for us and we just copy paste it um so from that standpoint it's the barrier to entry has gotten lower from the standpoint of product sourcing and product development I think the barrier to entry's gotten lower the thing that has gotten really hard is cutting through the noise and finding something that actually has legs in today's market and I think for that you have to be super in tune with who's doing what and who's Finding Traction or who is just about to find traction or who's seeing hints of traction um you also have to just solve something real like there was a huge era of d2c brands that happen during um probably like right before covid and then definitely during covid or brands that didn't deserve to exist the 48th men's skin care brand the 37th white labeled supplement for bloating um you know these things these are not solving real problems they're just trying to be like money grabs those don't really last because consumers today are pretty smart and they will see that from a mile away whereas a brand that is actually solving a real problem for the consumer but also hopefully for something bigger those tend to stick around and you know have really no problem growing or sometimes like cookware look at cookware Brands over the last four or five years they've all just exploded every cookware brand I know is doing over 100 million dollars in revenue and um you know it's just like when when the trend starts to go if you can jump on that train you will ride that to the top yeah those companies that are doing 100 million in Revenue let's say like what's a bottom line an average bottom line probably like 20 15 to 20 percent it's not bad yeah yeah not terrible for like you know cash in the bank at the end of the day all things paid cool yeah I mean I'm interested Nick like if you ever want to collab on a on a juicy let's do it let's make the Carly bot what we should do is you you handle like the d2c concept fulfillment marketing and then I'll handle the Tech stack like AI car they bought and some cool fun AI stuff that and and Community stuff that just like makes the experience unique yeah I'm totally game for that um all right Nick thanks for coming on like I think everyone should sign up to your newsletter where could people find your newsletter the easiest place is just nick.co email Nik dot Co slash email I think if you just Google Nick email it comes up as well yeah and this is like this email I subscribe to it and I'm not huge in the d2c space I think I told you this Nick my dad who has like us has a Shopify store as like a side Hustle was telling me about you not knowing that we knew each other and he loves your emails without some emails and shout out to Mr eyes Mr Eisenberg and uh so it's really it's really it you know what I like about it is it gets me thinking and you you give good examples of other brands doing cool stuff so yeah I think a lot of the things I talk about too

[Music] foreign [Music] [Music] Finkelstein round two maybe let's start off with with that you know how do you think about hustle versus ballads I'm not sure I'm the right person to ask that question to I I think that I'm trying to optimize my entire life for no uh no transition time or low transition time so I either want to be like full-on you know like hustling and building our business at Shopify or I want to be doing things that give me great you know great joy being with my family um you know meeting interesting people having great conversations you know doing the hobbies that I love to do but I don't want any transition time or I want to have it reduced as much as possible and so I don't necessarily know what the takeaway message there is but I um I remember like when I was in high school the commute from I was living in South Florida that commute from my house to the high school like it was wasn't very far it was probably two or three miles but it took us like 30 or 40 minutes to get there when there was a lot of traffic and I remember thinking that was like the worst part of my day because um I was pretty ambitious in school I wanted to do well I was also an entrepreneur I had a DJ business in high school but that was the worst part of my day maybe the first week because it was just non-productive time and so I don't think every moment of my day needs to be structured around efficiency or productivity but I don't want to have time where I'm not enjoying or I'm not building and if it's if I'm not doing one of those things like that is bad use of my time and I think I've optimized that as much as possible so I woke up on Monday and for whatever reason I wasn't feeling excited about work and motivate it so I texted a friend and I was like I have I'm sure like you have like a Founder group chat and I just texted these these Founders and I was like Hey like this is how I'm feeling I don't ever I don't feel like this very often um and I got this really good response that I'd like your opinion on and I tweeted it so one of my Founder's friends says I actually don't think your life will improve much by applying more pressure I think your life will improve most by creating space to think by protecting nurturing your energy by doing the things you take on really well and by using your capital and consistent manage risk ways that you can basically rinse and repeat you're at the point that if you can use eight to ten hours in a highly leveraged way in a week that creates more return return than 50 hours of hustle strive for those eight to ten hours to be worth five thousand dollars an hour and then do all the things with the rest of your time to keep those hours valuable what do you think about that I think that's great I mean I think you know there's sort of this this Mantra in our in our world in these sort of Entrepreneurship World which is uh work really really really hard and and then there's this other Mantra which is like work really really really smart and I think by the way I think platitudes are are a silly way to run your life but I I think in particular those two like um it's a false dichotomy it's not either you're working harder working smart I think there are certain times where you just have to do the work um what I'm preparing for earnings call there are I don't know 50 60 metrics that I have to know I just have to do the work I have to memorize those metrics I have to really understand how we did what the different you know factors that led to those uh the results have been there's no shortcut for that in other times there's a particular goal I want to get I don't know over here Supreme onto Shopify and like that's my goal and in that those cases there's probably a smart way to do it there's also probably a hard way to do it and in that case I find you know the smart way is almost always better so I agree with that and and by the way you waking up on a Monday and you're not feeling great like that is a very healthy thing nobody work wakes up every single Monday feeling like they have the world uh and and you know by the tail and and that everything is always amazing years ago I remember thinking that um I think it was on a podcast or I was giving a talk and someone said you know uh have you hit your goal of happiness or something like that I was like I was like No And then I don't think happiness is necessarily the goal and the best example I can give you is that you know you may be happy having a great day everything's going your way you stub your toe and all of a sudden like you know you feel like [ __ ] first for for a few minutes um I think more than for me the more important thing is is meaning am I like do I have a meaningful life am I doing things in my life that are are deeply meaningful to me this podcast this interview with you is deeply meaningful you and I have known each other well before you know you were Greg Eisenberg and and anyone even heard of Shopify um and and but so this is a deeply meaningful you know conversation because you and I knew each other before anyone else did and watching each other's journey and growth has been I think on both sides of the coin uh there's real Pride for you know it sounds weird because we're in our 30s and like we'd say that but like you know there's a lot of Pride for Mutual Pride for each other's Journeys um that's meaningful to me after this I get back to like my work at Shopify which is deeply meaningful and then I think I told you sort of the pre-show my wife and I are going to spend the weekend just two of us we've had a lot of like we went to Disney World two weeks ago with the kids it was kind of very kids I don't know there's a lot of kids stuff in our lives right now my wife and I just want to have a weekend just Harley and Lindsay and so we're gonna go away this weekend and just spend some quality time the two of us also very meaningful and I think the more as you look at your calendar and your schedule if there are things in your account on your schedule that you're like that's not meaningful that's not meaningful that's not meaningful then you should make a change but if you wake up on a Monday morning and fundamentally you're just not feeling yourself like you're not really in that in that zone it doesn't mean you're failing it doesn't mean you should change everything you're just maybe having like a shitty morning and that's okay and I I think um you know one of the things that great um psychologists and great therapists but also great coaches teach you is to name things I am feeling this way what is this oh this is anxiety oh this is depression um so like the naming things really help but also but the reason I think naming things is so is so valuable is that once you name something oh like I'm feeling anxious now okay what happened in the last two hours that made me feel anxious oh yeah well I had those phone calls and then you begin to sort of pattern match and you're like okay I actually think today is going to be a tough day and I can prepare for a tough day because I've pattern matched it on days like this I usually leave you know I usually leave my desk feeling pretty exhausted and and I think the quicker you begin to be self-aware about those things uh the quicker you're able to identify yeah I'm not feeling great it's Monday morning I'm just not I'm not I'm not the Greg Eisenberg I want to be um the better off you are and I think that's something that I've only re only recently learned to do I think for a long time I had these blinders on and and you know call them like hustle blinders where it was like like I don't deserve to be anxious I don't deserve to be sad I don't deserve I have to just work and work and work and work because like if I don't everything is going to crumble and that's not the case you can still be highly productive and very very impactful but also have the acknowledgment that like I'm not doing great at this particular moment there's something about where we grew up and how we grew up that equips us with hustle blinders out of you know out of the womb and I'm curious if you can shed some light around you know how meaningful you know growing up in Montreal being Jewish being Canadian that has you know yeah I'm sure she can just shed some light around what that means to you what have you learned and you know 99.99 of people listening to this you know don't know that you know people from that neighborhood so can you explain a little bit more about that um so first of all there's this very very famous quote from Alexander Chalmers and it's called the three grand Essentials of happiness uh something you do someone to love and something to hope for or something that you know that that you're excited you're looking forward to and those are sort of what what Alexander Chalmers calls the three grand Essentials of happiness or meaning I guess is where I think there's a fourth one by the way which is um the environment I think you also need to be an environment that inspires you and you and I grew up in an environment that was deeply inspiring to us and for those of you that don't know Montreal is um the second largest city I think in Canada maybe the third now uh the second or third largest uh it is the only City I think that is fully bilingual uh and I guess Quebec is the only Province or area that is fully bilingual um but more importantly most importantly it is a city of immigrants in the 40s 50s and 60s Montreal was the recipient of hundreds of thousands and millions of immigrants from all over the world from every single background and in the case of my family where we came in 1956 from Hungary Holocaust Survivors uh came after the Holocaust went to Hungary Hungarian Revolution forced them out of their home again they ended up coming to Canada Canada had a program where they um LED in 40 000 Hungarian refugees in in 1956 my my father and his siblings and my grandparents came to Canada and came to Montreal at that particular time so Montreal has been historically of a city of immigrants full stop but what that has done is it has created a sense of entrepreneurship because of survival uh rather than entrepreneurship because of passion it it created a place in an environment where everybody you knew growing up just about had a small business was an entrepreneur started something um the famous One in Montreal of course is the shematza company like a clothing business that was there was a big clothing company but it was a city of entrepreneurs and everyone you met generally seemed to be an entrepreneur or a small business owner or in some cases a much larger business owner in fact the heroes of Montreal growing up were people like Sam brothman who created Seagrams again an immigrant that came to Canada from Eastern Europe who created Seagram's or the demere family who again you know came uh came to Quebec I think originally from Sudbury and built this crazy company or the pelidos the Quebec world so two things were just you know you were smacked in the face with these two these two interesting ideas growing up and one you knew a ton of entrepreneurs and two the heroes of the city they were not fifth or sixth or eighth generation you know Aristocrats they were in Barrens or or tycoons uh the people you look up to were these first or second generation immigrants who happened to build these incredible businesses and then were incredibly generous in helping to build the city and giving back and I think that that instilled the sense of entrepreneurial um DNA but also this identity that if you have an idea for a business and you grow up Montreal there's a very good likelihood you're going to probably try your hand at that and I don't think that is the case anywhere else uh not not to that extent now I I have I've come to realize because I've said this I've given the story a couple times that there are other cities Chicago La Miami New York like some of the bigger cities have it but there's a grittiness for Montreal that actually I've seen a little bit in New York City and NCAA lived in Chicago um that that seems unique and people that are going to be watching this you're gonna tell me what your city was like that too I I don't doubt that for a second but in Montreal it was so it was so obvious and so apparent and so I think growing up with that one it gave me the permission to always consider myself an entrepreneur when I moved from Montreal when I was 13 to South Florida um I was like I went to high school I was I went to public high school big high school and I was this short Jewish Canadian kid in school but I was also I I I introduced myself as oh I'm also an entrepreneur I have this DJ company and I'm always you know tinkering on these new business ideas and and for the most part there wasn't anyone else like that in fact most of my you know classmates in high school thought that was kind of a weird thing that wasn't the case in Montreal and Montreal like a lot of my friends that I grew up with were also like you I mean you had a web website development company I think when you were what 14 15 right so like it just wasn't that uncommon when I went to South Florida it was very uncommon in fact it was it was it was unique and and someone alienated and so that's a long answer short question but I think growing up in a place like Montreal where we were inspired by the greatest entrepreneurs that we actually knew we were right into them it wasn't like we didn't read them in textbooks we met them at like some some Jewish Delhi uh and we knew their stories our our parents and grandparents told us their stories we were inspired by that and so Montreal entrepreneurship and frankly um that the culture not necessarily the religious aspect of Judaism but the culture of Judaism is a big part of my life in fact so much so that uh I don't know if I said this to you on the last time we were on but Lindsay and I my wife and I and our and our daughters we were actually moving to Montreal in five months from now full time and part of it was uh after the pandemic Shopify is now digital by Design so we have people all over the world and we began to think about where do we actually want to live live our life and we looked at a number of amazing cities Miami and New York and some other cities like that and ultimately settled on Montreal because we just think it's just very very unique and there's there's nothing like it anywhere in the world and so uh we're moving there so if you're not from Montreal you're not from Chicago you're not from L.A not from Miami what what are some takeaways for people that they could wake up Monday morning and get into that Montreal mentality okay so I I I've been thinking a lot about this because I live in Ottawa okay I've lived in Ottawa now I moved here in 2005 to go to law school uh that was the year I met Toby became one of the First Merchants on Shopify like that was a you know it was it was important but I came to Ottawa to go to law school because a mentor of mine happened to be teaching law at the University of Ottawa in 2005 and and he convinced me to go to law school to become a better entrepreneur I think I've told that story on the show before Ottawa is not an entrepreneurial city Ottawa is a government Town one-third of I think it's like 32 to be specific of the residents in this city work for the governance the capital of Canada so inherently there is not an entrepreneurial spirit in this city you don't have the same type of immigrant hustle here you do in Montreal and that was really challenging for me and so what we had to do was because there wasn't organically a tribe around us of other people like us we had to build our own and that actually led to uh fresh Founders which was the group of of a number of us that got together every Friday and we created a tribe of our own of entrepreneurs in a city that is not inherently entrepreneurial and funny enough that that group that we created ended up building you know get around uh travel pod uh fellow uh fluid surveys Shopify uh it's kind of an amazing interesting group of people um but we had to create our own and so I've thought a lot about if you are not in a city that is especially entrepreneurial if you were you know you and I were both in Austin two weeks ago right I believe yeah for South by I mean there's this crazy energy in Austin it's unbelievable right and you want to have a lot of mutual friends that have moved there recently like you know every second person you meet is doing like an entrepreneurial podcast and like every second physical retail store is a direct consumer brand I mean like it's unbelievable I walked down I think it was Sixth Street and it was like it was aloe yoga and then James purse and then to covis and then all birds it was like all these amazing Shopify Brands I was like I felt like I was home most places aren't like that and so if you don't live in a place like that you have to cultivate your own version of that you know smaller subset and you actually have to very intentionally create a community so there's there's two I want to dissect that a little bit so there's two pieces of that so one what you're saying is peers basically having peers that you can that can inspire you essentially um the other piece is mentors and I think you're really interesting person with mentors because you have in my opinion a set of like yeah I would say obvious mentors like people who like you know Seth Godin someone like that who I'm like yeah like it makes sense that like you you know you would look up to someone like Seth Godin and and he and you guys would get along but then you have a set of non-obvious Tech you know mentors who might be a lot older can you talk more about how you think about mentorship yeah um so I mean like it is it is unbelievable uh to me even to this point that I I have relationships with with these incredible you know like people uh and and some of them are are very well known you mentioned Seth and uh I'm lucky that I have people like that in my life but there's also um a set of I like your term non-obvious the reason I think that's even more important to talk about is because everyone who is listening has access to non-obvious potential mentors who unequivocally will change their life if all they did was reach out and so part of what I've been trying to do is is just as I've you know as I got married and had kids and and and and our business at Shopify can use to grow is just be on the lookout for people that I find to be really interesting in one particular aspect so either you know great relationship great parenting uh they have a certain like a joy of Life they have you know um and forget about age forget about their net worth forget about like you know I I I'll say the sentence this isn't just blowing smoke like I really look up to you Greg and what you've done with this show like you have this incredible appetite and desire to share these stories around like the new version of business creation and community building around and using Community to build a great incredible businesses and you're just doing this like you're like [ __ ] it I'm going to create this incredible where it happens program and I'm gonna do it uh I I I'm gonna do it like all full on so I've just been on the lookout for all these different people and so what I've sort of do more recently is take the next step and say look like I I know this is kind of a weird thing but like I notice how you are you know with your spouse and notice how you are with your son or daughter on the ski hill on Saturday can we can I talk to you about that can I ask you about how you were so um Mindful and so present with your spouse or like can I ask you about like I noticed you and your wife are always holding hands like that seems so nice and so romantic and my wife and I like the whole hands also but like you guys are always holding hands like what's that about and what you start to realize is that all these people that exist they may be 90 years old or they may be 17 years old they have something to teach you and if you can simply just you know ask them a set of questions that allows you to derive some some value and input from that there they really like talking about this too these non-obvious mentors by the way they don't have a lot of people asking them for their time in fact I I I've enjoyed this so much that um I recently put together this this project called Big Shot which is me sitting down with these non-obvious for the most case these these older Jewish entrepreneurs in their 70s 80s and 90s and just ask them questions about their life and ended up recording the whole thing because I think that I want to create an archive of these stories but you realize as you meet these people that are again non-obvious mentors how much they have to teach and how nobody is no one has heard their stories and so non-obvious mentors actually have a non-obvious amount of alpha uh in terms of teaching and insight and impact that you can derive if you simply ask them about it and for me in particular these you know older Jewish entrepreneurs who came to North America with literally nothing and have built multi-billion dollar companies and have have created the largest charities in some cases they bought me they brought Major League Baseball to a new country like Canada uh in the case of of Montreal Expos I want to understand how the hell that happened I want to know like how that all went down I want to know you know the person that that built you know 20 skyscrapers I want to know how that person first got their their initial round of financing to build their first skyscraper at 24 years old with no experience no one else has been asking those questions no one asks no one else has been going after those people and saying can you tell us your story yeah so love this first of all just absolutely loving this uh thank you I think it's fun yeah this is great so you would love by the way like big shots yeah the first episode comes out tomorrow uh this is not a plug for big shot but but Greg in particular like you're you're gonna love this because these are people that are like it's like it's it's part documentary and it's part sitting in a Jewish delicatessen like on Second Street in New York and like it's like if the walls can talk at an old school Jewish deli this is what they would say yeah so I'm I'm not going to say where I live but I live in an island where the average age is very high so I spend a lot of my time just sitting in hot tubs with old people [Laughter] you should turn you should record those conversations from the hot tub yeah and I know that sounds weird but it doesn't sound weird it sounds amazing if they're having instant conversations and you are getting access to those conversations I mean these are people that have had three or four lifetimes compared to us yeah yeah and they have so much to teach um but I mean I I guess to summarize like I'm fascinated by the non-obvious mentors in a way that like I've the obvious mentors that I have I'm grateful for but I've I've read their books and I'm able to choose to hear their stories and anecdotes across a whole variety of of media podcasts television shows in their books on you know across on social media and and on their blogs but these other people that are equally as interesting um there's a lot of alpha there because they haven't told it and and so back to your earlier Point by the way if you're in a city or in a place where you don't have like it's not Austin Texas and you don't have like you know Tim Ferriss is randomly walking around and and showing up and having a conversation when I was when I was at when I was in South by I think you know this I interviewed Tim at the Shopify space and Kevin Kelly just walked it like like Kevin Kelly from 1 000 true fans like that he just walked into the shop by space like oh and actually Farhan he works shop like he saw Kevin in line and said I think Kevin Kelly is in line to get into the space like Kevin come in like that doesn't happen in Ottawa right because it doesn't happen in Ottawa Canada where I live I've had to sort of create um versions of that on my own and and it's not easy but it's incredibly rewarding here's I want to double click into the alpha comment that you made here's why non-obvious mentors provide Alpha is because they're gonna help you create products that go against the grain and when you go against the grain that's where the opportunities lie right they give everyone is saying hey go build a startup like XYZ on Twitter then [Music] the moat you have a smaller moat yeah it's it's you know um after we had our first child after Bailey was born in 2016. my wife and I would go for these walks every day newborn baby like can't do much uh you know babies like sleeping or eating most of the time so we went for these walks around our neighborhood um here in Ottawa and Lindsay my wife had said hey you know I I would love to go for some great ice cream there's an ice cream shop I'm gonna create an ice cream company I'm gonna create an ice cream retail shop uh called Sunday School and of course like I'm like you know I'm I'm I'm the poster child for entrepreneurship I'm like the physical manifestation of like the entrepreneurial Spirit uh at least I hope I am or try to be and I was like Glenn's great idea let's do that and she's like great who do I talk to I was like I have no idea I don't know anyone that like I was like maybe we can call Ben and Jerry like I think you know like I I maybe they'll take my call maybe they'll answer my email anyways Lindsay is like leave it to me and she went around she found all these incredible ice cream entrepreneurs and she developed these relationships with them and Sunday at school like was rocking like like the setup the design the production uh every aspect of Sunday school was like I'm this is like me being very proud of my wife I was [ __ ] perfect it was so well done and the only reason uh but not the only reason but one of the only reason Lindsay was able to get that Insight was because she didn't listen to me she didn't call Ben Jerry she didn't call Haagen-Dazs she didn't call Baskin Robbins she called these like these fairly um unknown or non-obvious ice cream Entre entrepreneurs and she began to network in that community and they gave her all this amazing insight and if she would have listened to me and she would have called Ben Jerry's because my answer for everything is like who's the biggest ice cream entrepreneur that's who we should talk to she didn't do that she went to these not all these ice cream mentors and she was able to build an incredible business doing it um and they were so happy to hear from her because some of these ice cream entrepreneurs are in their 60s and 70s some of the one of them it was 85 and they were worried that the next generation of of ice cream you know business owners ice cream company business owners wasn't around and so they were delighted to hear this 35 year old woman from Ottawa Canada really was excited about becoming an ice cream entrepreneur and they gave her um a disproportionate amount of their time relative to what she would have got if she would have called someone that I was going to recommend I think a big takeaway for for people listening to this is you want to surround yourself non-obvious like it's good to have these not obvious for example ice cream entrepreneurs but it's also good to have the Harleys or the Ben and Jerry's also and and thinking about maybe you start not obvious but over time you can scale with like oh yeah you know now I can call Ben and Jerry's and scale this thing yeah exactly at some point if Lindsay was looking to raise money or you know uh for the ice cream company I think that Ben Jerry's could be helpful um uh I think Ben and Jerry's actually his own Now by by a large cpg I I suspect a big conglomerate but that's exactly right or if she needed to figure out like something really you know complicated like uh dairy uh tariffs in Canada versus the US there's probably a lawyer she would have to call there but but that's exactly right and the cool part about this non-obvious mentorship and and and and that leading to finding Alpha is that everybody can do it there is someone in your town if you were listening who makes like I don't know um like the caps for water bottles like that person may have a huge company that no one's ever heard of and the stories you will get number one will be so fascinating but more importantly they may teach you way more of a business than you're going to find in any business book yep absolutely I need it I need to share two small but big wins that I've had in the last three weeks with you that I haven't shared with anywhere wow well with everyone but just something that's related to this so they say don't meet your Heroes but I'm like I made a goal for myself that this month I was going to meet my heroes wow so I dm'd Rivers Cuomo who's the front man of Weezer yeah amazing and to me he's like a non-obvious role model even though he's big like he's not obvious in the sense like you know he's not Tim Ferriss or Seth Godin so I DM to you know if you're watching this on YouTube you know I dm'd him this um I basically said I bet you hear this a ton your art has been life-changing to me often in La would be cool to hang out sometime and he responded instantly wow and he was like let's do it I'll be here until June what part of the world you're in so I tell I tell him I'm in Miami he's like oh I'm gonna be in Tampa even though that's not even near Miami but I'm going to be in Tampa in a couple weeks come let's come hang out I so I go to Tampa and I have you went to Tampa to meet him I went to Tampa to meet him cool car breaks down Midway through of course you know just just in the Everglades which for people to know before that's like there's alligators all over yeah it's not a great place to have the car break down that's right no yeah no exactly but I'm doing this right because I'm thinking to myself how could I make 16 year old Greg really proud right now I'm going to the show so go to the show I meet with him backstage and I have this 20 long Co 20 minute 30 minute whatever it was conversation with him around um like rock and roll and music and programming and all these different topics and I left that show just getting completely inspired and my my biggest takeaway was DM like you'd be surprised who would respond to your DMs quick Interruption from me if you're listening to this on Apple podcast or Spotify you're getting any value you need to come to YouTube and subscribe to the where it happens podcast YouTube channel I promise you the experience is richer more interesting so if you're getting any value just stop what you're doing open up the YouTube app go to the website and press subscribe at where it happens on YouTube and if you're watching this on YouTube and you haven't subscribed what are you doing go go press subscribe thank you enjoy the rest of the show and by the way that like if if he wouldn't have responded the cost of failure is literally 30 seconds of your time correct that's all it is and I by the way I love I love that I especially love it because what you also realize is that um he probably you know you didn't tell us this point of uh perspective but what he probably learned from you about the future of music and the future distribution and the Weezer community and like what that Weezer you know Africa album did like like I rediscovered Toto through Weezer that's right like it's an unbelievable thing that like like you probably dropped all this great knowledge inside on him and and he probably feels like he got as much out of that meeting as you did and and everyone listening can do that exact same thing right now um and and again as long as you don't have a fear of failure or a fear of rejection which by the way you should not have like there who cares you may actually build the most like you may have a relationship now uh Greg with him for the rest of your life well that was the cool thing at the end he was like oh I have to you know get back or I'm going to Orlando right now but like here you know you gotta we gotta hang out soon we're hanging out soon and now he's like I could say like Rivers is my homie you know it's amazing that's amazing I I did something recently uh during the pandemic um I sort of saw or heard that uh Tom Green is moving back uh from from LA to Ottawa his parents live here and I randomly sent him a note and said hey Tom a huge fan I grew up watching MTV and watching the Tom Green Show and I think you're super cool and we we hung up we've hung out a bunch of times in fact I think I introduced Tom to you yeah as well um and now like Tom is like introduced to me to his friends I've been shooting Tom to my friends like that all happened because of a single Instagram DM and he had not heard about Shopify he didn't know who I was he was like oh this kid from Ottawa where I'm moving to just reached out I'd like to meet new people especially people that seem like they're in Tech and doing interesting things like that is unbelievable and by the way that was impossible 10 years ago so what advice do you have to people who who you know have a Target list of of people who could be role models and mentors and like like what do they need to type in the DM for for someone like you to open it up and read it and reply I I I find for some um the DM is really really challenging sometimes because they have a lot of things coming in and a lot of people coming in a lot of people messaging them one one other way that's super simple is almost everyone you want to meet has some sort of um not everyone but most people have some sort of philanthropic charity and Foundation they're connected to that means a lot to them and if you do research on them it is very obvious what that is and if you make a donation it can be literally 18 okay because I've tried this 18 uh to a charity or a foundation that they care about and you put in the memo like I am donating this because I was inspired by this particular thing this particular person did and I'm doing it in in their honor um and then you DM them now it's like now you have two different touch points now all of a sudden like I keep seeing this guy's name like like the [ __ ] is Harley Finkelstein he gave 18 to this charity I really care about he sent me a DM he also bought something from my merch store he bought like three t-shirts and left a really nice comment a nice review you can create something that is number one very lightweight very inexpensive that can give you a ridiculous amount of reach to the people that you want and then once you have those relationships like that's when the work really starts because it's one thing to get a first Connection in Tampa with you uh you know to have a meeting that's great but the fact that he is now your homie um means that it means that you have also contributed like you were sending him text messages you were you were reminded of something that was discussed in the conversation and you're like hey this is a cool article you should read this I know you were thinking about this hey by the way I saw this other thing check this out and that is really how you build real relationships now I just want to say this the thing some people will say well isn't that superficial you're sort of like you're using uh tactics to build a relationship no every single friendship every single relationship is built on some sort of shared experience some sort of shared centerpiece of Interest or connection and so if you marinate that and and and like it is not transactional because ultimately the only thing I want from these people is to get to know them better because I think the more I get to know them the more interesting uh the more interesting they become to me the more I can learn the more I can share with them like that is how you build real Community you don't build real Community by having a one-time let me pick your brain here's 10 questions and then never call them again you know those people are never going to be quite about your homies um they'll be your homies if you actually are able to create a real dynamic between like what they need what you which you need what you want and and it doesn't have to feel transactional or superficial because some of my you know some of my closest friends today are people that started out as mentors to me and now like they're huge parts of my life and I'm a huge part of their life and I feel very lucky to have that and and but it's it there's it's real like it's authentic even though it may have started from what seems like a business pitch so Step One is do your research like do do your proper research do your Danny Miranda style research shout out to Daddy Miranda man he does his research the steady Miranda found out where I went to high school uh and drove by the high school before he interviewed me because his grandparents lived nearby like holy [ __ ] that's like next level research that's why I was like I'm not even gonna do research for this just listen I didn't write this podcast exactly so I did that um do your research so no know what's important to them through that step two is I mean you want to craft a short and sweet message too right like you can't you don't don't have like a null but don't send a novel yeah either not novel is bad and hey can I pick your brain is bad yeah don't write High context like you're right like like high context thoughtful don't waste their time and there's a connection I mean for like the people that reach out to me now like they're like my life is so public right everything I'm interested in whether it's like Shopify or it's fire bellied tea or it's big shot or it's my wife and family like I'm so public like there were so many intersections of me with pretty much most people that like you can figure it out and and I do the same thing um in fact it's more challenging because I like to figure out you know one of the people that I interviewed recently was this guy named Aldo Ben sedude do you know how old I've been so dude I do yeah uh so this guy's amazing like the guy like he's an immigrant from Morocco comes to Montreal with no money he was given a small little section of a retail store uh where he was able to sell his own shoe sort of a store within a store and turn that little literally a shelf into a multi-billion Dollar Empire called Aldo the shoe company any city in America in the world you see all the shoes he built that from one single shelf and so like his his story is not out there so having the the way that I was able to First make contact with him was I remembered that I'd met him at a bar mitzvah that I DJ'd literally 22 years ago um listen that 20 years ago um I remember when I was like 18 or 19 or so I DJ the party he was there and he came up to me and he said yeah you're doing a great job or something like that and so that's how we started this relationship and then I figured out you know retail and commerce and and what he's thinking about and his connection to the Jewish community and that's how I ended up getting him to come on big shot and sit down with me so like there are ways to contact everybody and and and some of these people like no one's ever other people are not contacting them and so there's an opportunity for you listening right now to contact those types of people if you're if you're smart about it I have a fun Aldo story what is it so when I was 18 and this and this this is all going to relate when I was 18 I cold email to Aldo probably 70 times no literally literally actually didn't get a response so then I went one layer you know I was like okay who's in this circle and I I reached out to their head of marketing at the time rob oppenheim it was she was like director of Market okay okay yeah I've also done the map of the Aldo ecosystem because I was also trying to you know get to meet him so I know some of these people her name was Jillian okay um and I reached out and she gives me the time of day I'm 18 years old and I'm like I want to redesign all those website I mean they have how many store they had like 1400 stores at the time yeah um I didn't get their peaked ahead for some 50 stores around the world amazing yeah amazing and I was like you know I I earned her trust let's just say I earned her trust I was you know giving her a lot of yeah I earned her trust and then she said you could have a meeting with Aldo so I finally did it and I show up with my two partners who at the time were in their mid-30s because I needed like someone you know I I dare I still have like a hybrid I was gonna say like gray hair but they didn't have gray hair they're in their 30s and I'm so excited I'm like butterflies in my stomach prepared this whole presentation for for you know for him and it was this you know it was a picture of like a board room there was like 15 people at this meeting and then when I sat down they said Aldo will only show up for two minutes of the meeting and I was like okay are you serious he walks in Aldo goes I'm here for two minutes what do you got my partners were offended that they they got two minutes I looked at it like I've got two minutes it's amazing you got two minutes with like one of the most iconic entrepreneurs on the planet one of them walked out one of your partners walked out walked out and I was in this position where I was like what do I do right you got the meeting also right like he was it was into your name on the line not theirs not that not exactly and I was like that's not me that's not me I'm I'm here I'm gonna like I'm going to make these two minutes count and I just said okay screw the presentation I'm just gonna have a conversation with Aldo and it was an incredible conversation so I mean the lesson there and and the metaphor that I think is so valuable is like I never walk out neither do you I I am never offended I don't never walk out like if I can get a minute of someone's time if I can get five seconds someone's time who I otherwise or who's I don't deserve to have their time I'm gonna value that because who knows where that's going to lead and be the person that doesn't walk out of the meeting be the person that's not offended like you know is it shitty that you drove 40 minutes or 30 minutes for a two minute meeting maybe who cares like the guy is running 1400 stores he doesn't need a website but he's giving you time because you were able to influence one of his you know one of his someone on his team and and and he's giving you two minutes which has an opportunity cost because you can be doing all these other things like be the person that actually says I'm grateful for the two minutes let me see if I can actually get like take the students into four minutes and what I'm gonna say in the next two minutes hopefully gets you to sit down and spend a little bit more time with me and if it doesn't I just want to say I'm in like I'm super super grateful for the time and frankly I really look up to and admire what you've built and one day I hope to have half your success and like for someone like Aldo who's not an ego guy who's very kind very thoughtful you know immigrant entrepreneur from Montreal just like you were um he probably was like Hey like I'm gonna give Greg some time because I was in I was like Greg Once Upon a Time too and I I think being the guy that doesn't get it from the person that doesn't get offended and doesn't get up and walk walk out that's the way to win I'm just sorry I'm I I'm just remembering how I was feeling in that boardroom it was I wish I would have known the story before I sat down with Aldo for big shot because I would have told him this particular story um but it's it's you you're sort of we're also kind of in this conversation we're kind of flirting with another kind of topic which is this idea that our personal lives and our professional lives like really are kind of mixed together now right like we started by saying no we started we started by talking about non-obvious mentors but partially like mentors quote unquote used to be professional business mentors or professional like if I'm a doctor my mentors are going to be other doctors well and I think what a lot of people that listen to this podcast and the show think about is like like there is no separation between work Greg and and and and like non-work rag it's like it's just us right and we want to fill up our lives our buckets with people that are are Inspire us with people that influence us they may be relationship mentors they may be parent mentors they may be business mentors they may just be life mentors like you and I probably know a bunch of the same people um there's uh there's someone who who you and I both know actually who actually runs a funeral home in Montreal um and I'll say his first time won't say his last name his name is Ross and I think when when you see Ross who works in a funeral home day in day out there's something about this guy where he's kind of floating on air you ever notice that like he's always happy and there's always a smile at his face and this wonderful demeanor and and like I I don't I don't know exactly everything about his personal life I know very little about his business it's a funeral home uh every time I see him the joke I make is how's business I hear it's dead and he jokes and I laugh and he laughs kind of a dad joke but what I what I love about this particular person is it seems like he's always floating on air in this certain contentment and if I ever had a chance to see him not at a funeral what I'd ask is like can you like can you talk to me about how you you always seem to be so balanced because I'm I'm an anxious guy I'm you know there's a lot of pressure on me and and obviously you're in a situation which is very stressful you see people when us when uh when a loved one is passed away a but you always seem to be so calm and so collected and so you know content um like is that is that business Harley is that the president of Shopify or is that like Harley the human I'm not really sure but it doesn't really matter I think we're all just trying to construct our own version of of a personal board of directors um and I think you can do that now better than anyone including you know you know having um the founder of Weezer like you know as one of those people in your life which holy [ __ ] that is so cool I want to double click on the Ross bit just because I find that interesting what is it about what is it about a guy like that that keeps him so balanced like he it's such a hard job to do what he does and maybe the hardest maybe the hardest yeah it's like um I asked in the interview at softball that I do with Tim um I asked him I said you know out of all the uh out of all the advice you've ever been given uh through all your interviews he's done so or 700 interviews on the Tim Ferriss podcast you know tools of Titans uh tribe of mentors like what's the one thing that like one interview that really sticks out and he talked about this guy who um uh had lost I think he lost three limbs he was paraplegic and he worked in a hospice and the the advice that he basically gave Tim is is given everything I know uh don't believe everything you think that sometimes your mind plays tricks on you anyways that's a that's an aside but I remember thinking that like this guy and I I didn't really understand what a hospice was I know what it is but so after I spoke to Tim I actually looked up but hospitals like hospice is where people go fundaments ago to die you don't go to a hospice when you're going to recover it is basically saying you are going to pass on at some point soon in in the short in the short run um so this is where you're going to basically live out your days and hearing that this guy works there day in and day out and is is doing interviews with Tim and and and and on the podcast circuit talking about you know stories and insight and and sharing positive wisdom I was kind of Blown Away by that it's kind of like what what someone like Ross does he's in a funeral home this is where he works day in and day out and yet he is somehow has the ability to when you when you when you show up there he's out there smiling and laughing because it's a somber day you know but but when I saw him recently um after my grandmother died a few weeks ago he just he gave me a big hug it's like how are you doing I was like not great he's like I get it he's like let me know if you need anything but he had this this certain um devive um that allowed him to be there for people when things were really really challenging and I don't know what it is I'd love to learn more although one thing that I do know is that if you when I have gone into his office at the funeral home do you know this is awesome I made it I was waiting for you to say that let's go so his office is covered with toys There we go toys there there are these toys absolutely everywhere and so he's figured out a way to despite working in a place where people are constantly you know upset and down they just lost somebody that he's able to recharge his battery because when he goes into his you know his office um is is his Temple at the funeral home for a split second or for a moment he's he looks at these Batman figurines he looks at these you know funny toys and and that's how he's able to refill his own battery so we can be there for people that just lost someone I think that's incredibly thoughtful but more importantly that shows incredible self-awareness that that is what he requires in order to recharge and um one of the things I've been noticing is is is on days where I've had a really tough day where you know I've had a bunch of meetings and I didn't get the result that I wanted from you know three out of those four meetings I go home and I'm just not I'm not in I'm not my normal self I'm not vibing uh there's something off about me and so now when I feel that way I'll be like well of course that's how I feel I had three meetings and didn't go the way that I wanted uh the next day I have three or four meetings and they all go the way that I want it I'm home and I've got Swagger and like I'm high-fiving everybody and and and and and once again I remind myself that okay like it's the reason I'm feeling this way is because I had the three or four meetings what I'd like to get to and I'm not there yet is regardless of how my last meeting went how can I be a little bit more even Keel how can be a little more balanced because it is not fair to Lindsay and and Bailey and Zoe my daughter is my wife it's not fair to them that someone else um that I'm talking to in a professional context is affecting how their dad and Lindsay's husband is showing up at home and I'm not there yet but I think Ross would be the person to learn from in that respect couldn't agree more so happy you share that story and going back to the the feedback that my friend gave me and that founder group chat where he said do all the things with the rest of your time to keep those hours valuable I think he was referring to a little bit of recharging your batteries and have those you know temples to yourself whatever it is toys Sports whatever it is and go do that so that you can show up um with a game face yeah by the way like the the reason that like this little the space that I'm in right now is sort of it looks like this is is kind of you know I just kind of realized that as I was talking about Ross it's kind of it's the influence of Ross like those are like prototypes for Shopify Awards uh that's a supreme you know uh skateboard to remind Supreme was one of the stores and I always wanted on Shopify like for for decades for us like as long as I've been in Shopify I wanted Supreme on and and they came on uh on January in January to Shopify and it's a reminder of like how hard I had to work to get that um that's Savio from aloe yoga like uh during Christmas aloe yoga was exploding it was doing amazingly well and I really wanted to like they were worried about whether or not shop was going to keep up and and so I really went deep in helping aloe yoga and and supporting Savio uh who runs technology and digital there and he wrote this amazing see it but this beautiful holiday card thanking me for for um uh for the partnership so all the things I have here are these little reminders when I walk in after you know I grab a coffee or grab some water or I'm going in between meetings it's a reminder that like you know hey that that went really well that took a long time though really well hey like the merchants on Shopify they're actually my partners like I get to spend time with people that I actually really love and and really deeply respect and I think you need to have that it's not just physical stuff it's also the environment it's also you know you've mentioned sports like your ability to do stuff that recharge your batteries and I I think that's exactly what that your text was all about I mean proving the point right like you learn something here you are president of a 60 billion dollar company and a funeral home owner taught you like you had such a takeaway right and I mean I can write a book about this guy who by the way has no idea like if if anyone who's listening to this knows who we're talking about here we haven't said his last name yet but like we won't but like if you know we're talking you should call him and have him listen this because I don't think he has any idea of the influence he's had on me but it's true he has and it's kind of amazing and all of you have all of us have these types of people in our lives where they've influenced influenced us without even knowing it um yeah I don't know chefs do that by the way one of the professions that I find I get most from is is watching a really great chef in a really great kitchen not doesn't have to be 11 Madison Park and I'm in the expensive kitchen but watching a great chef or a great maitre d or a great server or waiter waitress in a great restaurant I find I get a lot of great inspiration watching someone in their environment particularly in a hot kitchen when it's a packed restaurant and I watch them and I'm like watching how they are under pressure and I look at their shoes are they wearing comfortable shoes and I watch their mannerisms and their voice inflection and I watch how they you know their their non-verbal uh you know non-non-verbal cues with their staff are they showing gratitude are they giving fist bumps what is there was are they smiling are they upset I find that's one of the places where um uh I I gain a lot of inspiration when I go but I love to dine and so that that's quite helpful I think this is where we end it where it's this needs to end only because I think that people uh it's not at all what we thought we would talk about I think I thought we'd talk more about like you know Lauren Bostick and skinny confidential and uh South by Southwest and the Creator economy but this is uh actually way more fun than that so I hope I hope people got something out of this because this was like you know like this is totally Ren it's like a random show but I I think it was really fun this is this is like uh Tim Ferriss and Kevin Rose have the random show yeah well actually so uh so I know a lot about that particular show because I know Kevin uh pretty well but I know Tim very very well and I know a lot about that and partially the reason that that goes the way it does and it's so interesting it's a phenomenal you know piece of content they put out is because they have such deep context with each other they knew each other well before either of them had dig or was Tim Ferriss and you and I kind of have that also and in many ways that's like that's the reason why these things flow is because we have this incredible shared context and if we can shape this context into actual like actionable lessons for people that are listening I think that's really cool while I was uh Brewing my fire belly tea right before this my girlfriend was like oh who are you interviewing and they said you and then she said oh like are you prepared like and I was like to be honest I have a whole list of questions but with Harley I'm just gonna like off the cup and just see what's on his mind and just have a conversation with him that's great I I I love it um and and thank you for supporting fire belly t uh I too have my fire belly to here uh which I love I mean I'm not supporting fire belly t firebelly's t is supporting me well that's good okay yeah in the sense of like I I believe you were one of the first customers when we when we when we set up fire belly T it's funny what five reality has done for me is like I didn't realize how many people out there actually had never had really great high-end T before and I get so many of those saying like I was a coffee person like when you when when I hear about tea I think about a gift basket that it was given to me like at some conference or something um it's sort of cool to kind of see how that how T connects people in a unique way I uh I've always been into tea and I used to go to this Chinese tea shop when I was a teenager or traditional tea ceremonies and I love that NDG oh that's very cool in Toronto I I lived in Toronto for a year as a young lawyer um in 2008 and they had something called cold tea do you know what that is yeah so after after the bar scene after the bar is closed uh you would go to these amazing Chinese restaurants you'd ask for cold tea and they couldn't serve liquor out because it was after serving time was over but they'd put it into these uh teapots they'd serve you beer and you'd have cold tea I mean this wouldn't be a random show with gray guys and we're gonna hardly think Osteen without that exactly a little tidbit if you're ever in Toronto and you're at a bar and it closes and you want to continue your evening go to a great Chinese restaurant and ask for cold tea um and tell them Harley and Greg sent you so I really want people to listen to your new show where I think people go to do that yeah uh it is uh it is a very personal project I've been working on it on on weekends uh mostly for the last year or so but it comes out this week it's called it's big shot dot show um you can just go there it's on Spotify and and and apple podcast um but it's a deeply personal project where I get to sit down and have these amazing conversations with what I some some of the greatest entrepreneurs that I know they're mostly Jewish entrepreneurs whose stories have never been told um and we just basically record the conversations and it's part documentary and part as I said kibbetsing in a Jewish deli uh but you can find it at bigshot.show I think if people listen to this and are bought into the idea of non-obvious being a huge unlock which I hope people are that's where you need to yeah it's basically it's an entire it's it's an archive of non-obvious stories but every one of the stories has shaped the world that we live in whether you know it or not and um it's fascinating and also I mean in some cases these are people in their 90s who whose stories you know change the world and and just have not they're not on the podcast circuit they're not they're on social media all right well so thanks very much thanks for joining of course Greg appreciate it take care

Title: Lessons In Brand From The Dobrik Scandal With Chris Josephs (Autopilot)
Published: 2023-04-12 14:00:12 UTC
Description:
Remember when Dispo launched with David Dobrik?

At first it was great and there was a huge buzz surrounding the app.

But it meant the app’s image was tied to Dobrik’s image.

Because if and when a scandal comes out surrounding that person, it can have disastrous consequences for the brand.

Title: How Creators Can Successfully Sell Using Collective Selling
Published: 2023-04-09 14:00:07 UTC
Description:
Less is more in influencer marketing.

If Logan Paul pushed for Prime sales at every opportunity, he would run the risk of deterring his community from buying any product at all.

Communities can quickly get fatigued with product offerings.

With collective selling you avoid this by spreading the product offering across multiple creators, who will have different audiences.

[Music] foreign [Music] [Music] people are listening to this on audio get on YouTube because you're wearing sunglasses I think you're the first person on the show to wearing sunglasses I feel today I felt like bringing the heat uh and I felt that I had these glasses and I was like I feel like the glasses give me a little bit of a mood for my day um and so I was like you know what I'm gonna bring the [ __ ] heat today I'm gonna wear the glasses I'm wearing them everywhere and tonight I'm going to talk at USC and I'm gonna wear them there too all right well as much as I brought you on here for your fashionista Vibes which are a plus the number one reason I brought you on is you are a wealth of knowledge a Fountain of Knowledge when it comes to creators there's a shift between thought leaders being on a pedestal talking down to you to now thought leaders talking directly to you at eye level get closer to yourself put blinders on listen to your own intuition and follow that not to go and find the person that I think that I am but to get close to the person that I know that I've always been by letting go of the parts of me that I know that I'm not how to build audiences how to build businesses on top of it I want to talk to you about it thank you I appreciate that and yeah I'm excited to talk about that maybe we can start with what are you seeing on Tick Tock to start with like what are some accounts that are are blowing up like what are Trends on Tick Tock a lot of people here want to create an account wanna go viral uh algorithm changing all the time what are you seeing out in the transit trenches um I think uh the first thing that I always go to is is storytelling because I I I I don't like to encourage people to do Trends because I think that Trends are fleeting that's not Trends are not a sustainable model for people to use in perpetuity and so I always lean on tell your stories like tell your tell your own life story tell the challenges that you've been through or particularly because I think the people that are listening to this are entrepreneurial or business minded tell your company story talk about the things that you're going through or the way that you got to where you are or the ideas that got you to even starting the product um it's it's just so hard to it's so hard for to find longevity when you're just following the trend of the day and that's what Tick Tock and that's how Tick Tock became popular was literally what's popping today trends of the day and it's just hard it's just really hard to consistently follow that um so I highly recommend people to lean into something that's way more sustainable and actually cuts through the noise which is Original Stories so would you recommend people just like how would you what are Frameworks or ways to think about how to pull stories out of people because we all have stories great question great question I even I even like wrote out what I would deem the actual formula for a video I went back and looked at about 150 videos that had worked for either for me in the past or had worked for other people that I liked that it seems like the linear progression of a story which is which very well correlates to the narrative Arc of an actual story and child like that children read some sort of intro which I call a hook that captivates captivates the audience then there's some sort of setting then there's a conflict and then the conflict gets resolved and then there's a call to action so like literally if you take those five things I'll I'll say it in kind of tick tock or I even would say short form because majority of the content now is works on every any platform but a hook a setting a conflict a resolution and a call to action those are the five things that I think uh I try to incorporate in my videos and I think the call to action is dependent on what the video is there doesn't need to be a hard sell it could just be like I hope this helps it could be no wishing you a great day it could be something that easy but I I people people consume with their emotions and when you create stories it's able to get people involved emotionally um and that's what you want that's what you gets people to actually care about what you're doing so that's the formula that I try to follow in a lot of my videos so what you're saying is it's almost like ignore the trends for now just focus on writing really good stories start by writing and then how do you think of you know once I've written several stories how do you think about filming Etc the way that I the the actual like in the weeds uh process that I think everybody should try and do to make it the easiest on themselves is first write out what you're going to say then go and record it on your like voice notes so go into a an audio only draft then once you have that audio draft go and look at the words that you're saying in the video and think about is there any archival footage any camera roll footage any things that I have that are on Google any articles that I was in any footage that correlates to the words that I'm saying in this story and then go and place it over it um and then outside of that so once you have that that'll get you to probably you probably have like you know 40 of the video will be archival footage things from the past and then you look at the other words that are like that's a lot of filler content like I was sitting there you don't have a you might not have a video of you sitting on your camera roll so you go and film those filler ones and then that at the end of you filling the filming those filler ones now you have a compiled video that is completed with the audio only file b-roll filler content and then I go a step further and add text over top of it that's not necessary you could honestly do the auto text that's on Tick Tock and Instagram and all those that just works just fine but that's the formula and how do you think about a brand account versus a personal account meaning if I'm a brand like yeah you know what's the expression people follow people not Brands so how do you think about um to me it's the same yeah I think you I think you Brands need to act more like human beings for them to build followings um they need to they need we need to they need to relate to to people because that's who's consuming it um we don't go on social media and have a so in and have a a brand only social media platform and a person only social media platform you're in the same playing field as every other person in the world and every other company in the world you have to be able to cut through that noise um just showing your product here's the way that here's the way that I think people think about it versus brands when people make content they're not selling as much because they don't have a product to sell they're just like putting their [ __ ] out there they're putting their content out there hoping that somebody likes it ideally somebody does companies have a product that they've worked hard on so they approach content uh in a way of we have the best product in the market we gotta sell this people need to know about it let's push it out there and force it on onto people's uh for you Pages or timelines then as consumers when you see that you're you immediately want to swipe past it because you're like what is this like this is I'm here to watch things that actually provide me value not to get sold to if I want to get sold to I'd go walk in the mall or go on Amazon my Amazon app or let you know things like that so immediately it's an easy way for people to just want to click to the next that's why the companies that think about who they're making the content for and actually provide that end user value or the ones that are able to build audiences so I think you need to be thinking more like a person does what's a non-obvious example of a brand doing really well on short form Bose really Bose yeah Bose on Tick Tock does a unique so it's easy for me to use something like Duolingo it's easy to use big ones like that I think somebody that does a really good job a company that does a really good job by creating original content that's contextual to the platform that is entertaining to watch and fits in the culture this Bose they make these original videos that are humorous that look almost like infomercials but they're not infomercials and they're like playing on the fact that they're bringing infomercials to tick tock and but they're very gen z-ish and they just do a really good job of creating and understanding the context and understanding the platform so that's a good example for you guys to look up go scroll down a little if it's not popping right now and look at some of the videos that have and it's like it's not trying they're not trying to be the coolest people in the world they're like they're they're understanding the humor of gen Z the lingo the culture how Tick Tock works and they're getting people to stop and pay attention that's right yeah and they've got they've got a lot of views like I'm looking at their pinned uh pin videos like 1.1 million 2 million 2.7 so something's working and that's a big big company now let me go smaller company for a lot of people that are listening I think the best for me for a lot of for a lot of smaller companies that are listening to this I think the best company in the world right now at doing content is midday squares I don't think there's anybody that comes even close to them um in terms of Storytelling in an organic way and knowing the end consumer and understanding the context of the platforms um they invest heavily into their content they know that it's something that's going to drive the business and I I don't see any other brands taking it as serious as them and that's why they're disrupting that industry that's why they're making a dent um is because people see their content and go oh [ __ ] when is this and then they back it up with having a good product and I think that those two things together are a recipe for some real damage and that's what people should be looking at so Nick's aldarelli who's uh the CEO has been on the show before I grew up with those guys so uh oh cool are you Canadian all right yeah I am nice that's awesome yeah so they've basically gone from zero to almost 20 million a year in revenue on their chocolate bar which is highly competitive category right so they started that and it's like how do you compete against Hershey's um and some of these Brands like you have to stand out and they've thought about what's really interesting about midday squares I think is when you buy a midday square like at the back of the package like you see the founders faces then it feels like it feels like you're you know you're kind of I guess they're what I'm trying to say is they're a creator-born brand from the start it's in their DNA yeah but the interest but the the caveat to that is they weren't creators they turned themselves into creators because they understood what would happen if they did and how that could be such a um such ammunition to what they were trying to accomplish and it's paid off really nicely and I think that a big thing that I think I think that that is the play I think for majority of people especially with what we're seeing today the creator-led brands that are popping with feastables and things that I'm a Chamberlain's coffee and all that that are like that that come into the market and immediately disrupt it's because they already have an audience because people like them as human beings and as creators so I think that companies that are starting today or even companies that aren't starting companies that are out of place right now where they're trying to disrupt the easiest way for you to disrupt is to actually get people to genuinely care about what you're doing then I go what's the easiest way to do that how do you get somebody to care about it's not going to be going and standing around at a mall it's gonna be going where everybody's consuming that is our phones that is social media that are the FL that is the platforms that we're on in spending majority of our days on our majority of our time on and learning how to execute there so I think the companies that really understand content will be the ones that disrupt the most granted you have to have a product that backs it up but for the most part I think that the biggest play to even get your foot in the door is through content I'll tell you the story of the company before midday square is that went nowhere which cool obviously isn't talked about so I actually had an idea for a Candle Company focused on men I chatted about it with um this guy Casey Carls who's Jake carls's uh brother Leslie and Jay Carl's started midday squares with Nick and basically I bought a third of the company and Jake was the CEO of the company and and the other two-thirds were owned by the Carl's we spent a bunch of money on this like really funny video that was supposed to be the launch of it right it was around the time this is like 20 I don't know 16 or 17. um it was around the time where it was like kickstarters were really big and the idea was if you could have like a really funny video It's Gonna spread across the internet so we spent all this time building this this video all this energy posted it got no sales and through that I think Jake learned that it's not about spending you know creating one video a year basically it's about creating one video an hour and building a brand for yourself close that company then they did midday squares and I think it's interesting yeah that's the story of that it's it totally makes sense to me because it's very in line with the brands that we work with or that we get on conversations with that are like how do we go viral and for me virality is such a fleeting thing for people because one going viral a single time for something that you don't actually care about is actually detrimental to your business into your algorithm as a platform because now all of your new content is going to be shown to that audience that isn't the actual audience that you're trying to go after so that's one thing but second is the real relationships that you're trying to build with your community aren't built in one video they aren't built from the single video that the person saw they're built from the videos that they see after that one video the smaller ones that don't pop off that you think didn't do anything because they got four five six seven thousand views but they trickled into the people that now actually care about you and those are the community that you're trying to really build with and that's the way that I look at it and that's why I was posting three times a day for a while on Tick Tock because the videos that would not pop would be the ones that people would message me and be like yo I really filled this one this one actually impacted me and those are the people that will show up to meet up or will buy the product virality is something that I think confuses a lot of people um and so that totally makes sense to me yeah I mean my first question was basically to you on this interview was how to go viral and I kind of half expected you to be like you shouldn't want yeah you shouldn't want to go viral like virality is a bad word in our world yeah you know you want to go viral when as a byproduct you have yeah exactly virality as a byproduct virality as a byproduct of putting out the content you genuinely want to put out is a home run virality as a means of just saying you went viral is I don't know what's an analogy for something that's terrible that can ruin your business I mean it's bad PR yeah it's just not it's just it's just not where I think people should be thinking I I look at it like this here's the way I look at all content it's a relationship when you go and you meet people when you move to a new city and you're trying to make friends you don't hang out with somebody one time and be like we're the best of friends you're gonna be in my wedding I love you I'll show up anywhere it takes time you have to put in repetitions you have to communicate you have to have like-minded interests you have to care for that person you have to like you have to build that's the same thing as an audience we get on conversations with people they're like look we have a month and a half where our team is investing we're ready to go if this doesn't work in a month and a half though our CFO or our team is we're pulling this we're not doing Tick Tock anymore not doing Instagram anymore we need content to work ASAP I'm I look at it I'm like this you need to build for you need to build for years you need to be building for a long period of time you're trying to build relationships well it's the same it's it's very similar to like how SEO works you know SEO isn't something that you know you change a few meta tags on your website and all of a sudden you're gonna get a hundred thousand people to your website tomorrow you invest in SEO because I mean you literally use the word invest because when you know you're constantly climbing up the rankings for these keywords that work and that you want and then at a certain point you're just you know 12 months from now sitting on a beach and people are just showing up to your website regardless and that's the same thing with social in general which is people have this expectation that you know I don't get a hundred thousand Twitter followers and I'll get a hundred thousand Instagram followers this you know this video doesn't get a million views or a hundred thousand views or even a thousand views I should just like quit and like the way I see it is it's very much like r d marketing r d you should look at it as like I have a mark you know with r d you set a budget 18 months 24 months let's go figure out an invention or let's go experiment that's the exact same way people should look at being a Creator and creating content is it's r d you figure out like what content works why it works while you're building the product um and then hopefully you don't go viral on day one hopefully you go viral on month 14. love it completely agree am I hired at your company yeah welcome what what does your company do um so we're we're all things content but the things that we specialize in is short form organic so we'll either consult on your current scene that you already have and we'll teach you guys how to improve your videos write stories create the content in-house uh for select few we don't do this for everybody for a select few will actually edit the content ourselves like we'll take your story we'll make it ourselves um and hand it back to you and then the second kind of area that we work on is we go into companies and build their content arm for them so it's really hard to find creators that want to come and work for companies what do people do when they try and find people that they want to hire they go on LinkedIn they go on indeed they search content creator I'm a content creator I know a thousand content creators not one of them would go and put their job profile on LinkedIn or or on upwork and be looking for jobs there so it's just not the they don't you don't find creators in that same typical way that you would find other employees you find them through the platforms and so what I've done is started making videos talking about is there anybody on here that would want to work for a company that would actually want to go in and run their account and not like one video a month or two videos a month like an influencer like literally you're with their team every day making content or every couple days making contact lo and behold I got 1500 people overnight that wanted to do that now that's turned into seven thousand so we have like a database of these creators that want to go and work with companies so we'll go into we will go into businesses and actually employ these people like we'll we'll introduce them to the team the team will hire to the company the company will hire them um as contractors or as employees and then we'll work with them to like get set up and like make sure that they're good and then that person will go and run the account make content for the business um manage it Community manage um and now we're and we'll continue to just kind of build on that so we'll now we're kind of starting to do where we'll find a creative director that will help with ideas for that company too sometimes we'll do a little social media manager we'll help with just the posting but they're not actually filming as much so all things content um within companies and like what's an example of a company that you work with and like what have you done with them uh super coffee so I mean companies that we found creators for we found big and small we've found we've done that kind of like internal recruiting for big companies like Nissan Sketchers Best Western uh but also smaller companies not smaller necessarily or smaller but not the smallest poppy super coffee belly Welly um a lot of cpg ones like that um almond cow um so all different sizes I would say our biggest criteria is cpg Le or New York based Health a little bit better for you or impact driven um is like the criteria that I think we specialize in but we go across the board super coffee we did both edited content for them help them build out their storylines if you ever see any of their videos where their Founders are talking about how they built the business how it happened in their college dorm we like storyboard that come up with the storyline The Arc of it film it edit it hand it back to them um and then we find them we found them a Creator too who does more man on the street stuff so he'll go and interview people um talk to people at schools talk to people around the city that they're located in so yeah do you ever okay so I run in I run multiple agencies and as someone who runs agencies every agency owner asks themselves should I be Building Product constantly right so in your case um could should you be creating a cpg brand like if you are able to build a lot of attention on social it's like all the only missing piece that you have is what is the product and the operational arm to it right like the actual like manufacturing fulfillment like at the midday Square guys how hard it like how hard it is to do that they built a a factory factory um yeah but you know does that interest you at all like yeah I will do that to a studio yeah I will do that um the thing the the long-term plan for me will be to build my audience as a Creator to the point where I feel like it has the leverage to launch a product through it and the product that I will launch through it will be purely based off of the community and their needs and the things that they feel like need to be innovated so if my audience continues to be creators or people in the creative world that are business-minded that are trying to get into content and they're like we hate our tripods or we hate our you know ring lights um and I have an audience that's a big enough size and I feel like that the market needs to be disrupted I will go into research and development and build a product to fit that need and then that's what I'll launched through my audience I don't have the I don't feel compelled to do that yet because one I think you need to have a bigger audience than I have and I'm not saying that I have a small one but I just think you need multiple hundreds of thousands on multiple platforms to really have that be the be an um immediate distribution to make a dent so I see this I'm seeing there's a lot of creators that I know personally and just the way that they're launching products and doing it well I think you need I think you need a sizable number so I'm building towards that and then when I get there uh I'll launch products through it and the agency arm that we have right now of all content and stuff will not transition into working for that brand but it will really help it will be the thing that kind of like Powers a quick Interruption from me if you're listening to this on Apple podcast or Spotify you're getting any value you need to come to YouTube and subscribe to the where it happens podcast YouTube channel I promise you the experience is richer more interesting so if you're getting any value just stop what you're doing open up the YouTube app go to the website and press subscribe at where it happens on YouTube and if you're watching this on YouTube and you haven't subscribed what are you doing go go press subscribe thank you enjoy the rest of the show what are some non-obvious creators like personal creators not bows like people people that are the future Mr Beast or Emma chamberlains of the world that you're like well you know let me keep a tab on that Creator because like they're gonna be doing big things the future Mr Beast I think is the future of Mr Beast I think is really hard because Mr Beast is more of an anomaly that people think um explain so many yes so many creators and so many business folk think that there will be more Mr Beast and that the next kid coming up is gonna be the next Mr Beast Mr Beast is is is literally an anomaly the amount of work that he puts in what he's built what he's been able to achieve and the timing that he's been able to do it um have all created a perfect storm for him I think that there will be the next sizable person like Mr Beast won't be in the style of him at all it'll be completely different because he's created a whole wave of this fast cut um attention span kind of error that I think now there's so many smaller creators that ever trying to replicate it that I think it will almost burn it out and I think the next style will be something completely different um that somebody will build through so there I don't think there will be another Mr Beast of his size plus the business that he has behind it with the team that he has is a bunch of savages they're incredible at what they do um and so I I just think that he's an anomaly so people that I think that you are that individuals should look at I really think that female lifestyle influencers and creators will build enormous businesses because women support each other more than men do women buy into other women's content way more than men buy into other men's contact in women lifestyle creators show a lot more than business people do so inherently the relationship that they have With Their audience is deeper if you pair a lifestyle Creator in the in a female Niche with a business minded individual that wants to come in and help them really build I think we will see a lot of companies come through that that will do damage and I'll give you an example of one that's doing that right now it's Bloom nutrition Bloom supplements with Mari Llewellyn I think her last name is Mari has built a big audience then built a supplement company around greens that helped her throughout her journey of Health and Wellness um now they are in Walmart disrupting the whole category in Walmart Nationwide and it's all done through her own personal accounts and through them building a community around her and her life um so I think that she does a great job and again it's it's pairing that creator with smart business people her husband and their team are smart people my fiance is another good example she's done a great job of building she launched her own Fitness platform they're bawling they're doing really really well I have I am not part of that at all so I can't take any credit but she just documents she shows her life people care about that and women support women and I I think that there will be a lot more people like that realm that'll be more realistic I have a quick story about that actually so right before I uh clicked record on this my girlfriend asked me hey who are you interviewing for the Pod and then I said your name and then and then she goes oh I've seen that guy because I am a subscriber to um I'm subscribed to the to your wife's platform that's awesome tell her thank you um yeah it's been I mean I'm proud I'm really proud of her it's been really cool to see her build um she does a fantastic job of cultivating community in that same in that same realm of just like putting in repetitions and it not being an overnight thing like she's been doing this for probably six years now seven years now and she was creating content like she wasn't selling anything for a long time for sure yeah she was fir she first was she was creating content on Instagram then on YouTube and then she was on a platform called um uh fit plan so she was a trainer on fit plan and then she realized wait a minute I would like to actually start my own things and she started her own thing and now it's doing well and now they're branching into different um Realms of actual tangible goods rather than just a an app um but they're doing a good job and they and that's an example of like a another female that I think has built community and then leverage that to build products through so I I think that we'll see a lot more people in that world rather than the anomalies of somebody like a Mr Beast but when you say like lifestyle female lifestyle like what does that really mean right like you have to don't you have to Niche down a little bit lifestyle is a niche health and lifestyle is a niche people follow people follow people literally just to see what their morning routine looks like and what they do during their day and what they're eating and what the the stuff that is mundane to you and I is interesting in to some people somewhere so like when I say to get more particular when I say lifestyle what I mean directly is probably a little more Health and Wellness skewing Health and Wellness creators individuals bloggers YouTubers whatever um and the reason why I think that they do a good job is because typically most health and wellness creators have struggled with something in their life that has led them to this journey of health and wellness and they share that and so the audience buys into that and then the audience goes on the journey with them which is the same formula that I think businesses should follow literally talk about most people start with a pain Point most people start with building their company because some should happen to them or a friend of theirs or their kid they saw something they start with a pain point they realize something needs to change and they go and they take action and then they get to that point where they're making change on that that's the kind of things that I think people should really be talking about and documenting the same way these health and wellness creators do because that's what gets people to actually buy into the mission and want to support it um so that's what I'm trying that's what I try to do in my content is just like show people what I'm doing and talk about it and actually listen to them and if there's anything that they would want to see more of I try and provide more of that yeah I think I want to emphasize one point you said which is really start with the mission right like if you you start with the mission you be consistent about content you find your own voice in terms of the type of content that you know you create you use this uh uh Arc narrative that you talked about earlier and then you just show up every day you know I I like to say like you know obviously you know Gary vaynerchuk his jab jab hook model I'm kind of like I believe in the jab jab jab jab jab jab jab bottle you know you just keep jabbing and giving value um and give value give value give value all around this mission um and lifestyle and if you keep doing that over time you're gonna understand a lot of these pain points then you'll be able to build stuff for those pain points fully agree um yeah but I I think it's continuing to just give and then ask and then ask which I think is actually Gary's which is actually I think the end of his thing is rather than give give take I think it's ask um yeah in terms of uh just going back to Mr Beast I had a friend of mine sent me something really interesting I'm curious your perspective on he said that he had analyzed the top 1 000 best performing Mr Beast tick tocks across the platform every month and found that 15 months ago the average length of these videos was 28 seconds it is now 40 seconds a 43 increase feels like a it feels a lot like 2017 YouTube when the YouTube algorithm started pushing videos with higher uh avd average video duration what do you think about that I don't know longer content or yes for sure yes for sure yes but longer meaning what like I do I think that people just want to sit for 35 40 minutes no do I think people are when I think people really are craving right now is content that doesn't make them have a huge spike in their dopamine and be like an addicting every three seconds they're seeing something new that's popping up so I that's why I think that they're that's why I think that the videos are going a little bit longer now because people are keeping in more pauses and more ums and less like the formula for the past while has been cut out everything that isn't fast-paced bad end noise add in uh text so that your eyes are going and following it all over and you're never able to click away um I think that us as consumers will crave more I don't even want to say still less but just more slower paced content um and so that would be my take on that I don't think that Jimmy and their team is making content longer just for the sake of making it longer I think it's probably the videos that they're doing now are probably needing and requiring that length for them to make a cut um rather than it being a shorter one with just the videos that they're doing now um yeah let's keep going um if you're a Creator and you want to get started on or if you if you want to do if you want to do short form like what's your creator stack because there is in terms of like what tools do you use yeah when you're working with brands um besides the obvious Tick Tock Instagram whatever yeah that but that's just the distribution to on the actual back end uh the ideas start in my notes and then when I and I'm just writing things that pop in my head all day then they go from my notes to notion which is where we have everything that's actually stored and housed so then they actually get formulated a little bit deeper in notion with the team and then once they're in notion um which is where the script will come from all usually either film that script looking into the camera or I will voice over or voice note um that script in My Voice Memos app on my phone um that gets uploaded to the cloud uh this is iCloud drive so me and my this is actually something I haven't shared with anybody this is actually like this is some [ __ ] that I think people need to think more of um rather than using a Google drive or Dropbox or anything like that me and my video team have a shared iCloud so on your actual iPhone when you're filming you can save rather than uploading it anywhere you can save to files which you could have a collaborative folder in so when I film a video I save it to there that goes immediately onto my editor's computer so as soon as I'm done I text him that it's in that folder you can even send a link um and then he gets to work on it so I go I have voice notes um if I'm actually editing the video myself I'm doing it in cap cut so I have cap cut on my phone I have cap cut on my computer that's the platform that I edit most of my content in my editor is using Final Cut or Adobe Premiere I'm not a computer guy I do literally 100 of my edits are from my phone so anything you've ever seen that from me hasn't been done on a phone um so I'll edit on cap cut and then the way that I do and then if I'm writing anything out like for LinkedIn it's using later that's the tech platform that I'm using for that it's scheduling um and then and then I distribute so that's usually what I do I film everything on my camera I don't film on Tick Tock I don't film my cap cut for the most part it's all filmed on my camera brought into these platforms edited voice over compiled together and then uploaded what you're watching right now is the day in the life of a Creator who runs his own company in Los Angeles and loves doing it the goal of all that you see me doing is to help people like yourself realize that you can build a business around the things that you're interested in by making contact and so that's what we do I have a great little team we use notion and I've got to give myself the best chance of success like using this tripod which you guys need to check out and then I jump on meetings I wouldn't want it any other way I love connecting with people and I'm super grateful for it midday break about content I created a workflow to upload things to an editor so I'm not doing it all but I will bore you with that and then back to meetings for a couple hours did I mention that I don't eat anything until about 3 pm I intermittent fast I love it I just do coffee and build out three the answer Summer's boss is on LinkedIn answer a few more emails and then when the Sun goes down I try to turn my lights down as well and how long does it usually take from beginning to end to create a video really depends on the video like if you look at a lot of my tick tocks a lot of my tick tocks is literally just talking to the camera those take the amount of time for me to say the words and then Auto caption them so those some of them legitimately take me 15 to 17 minutes total with captioning right hosting but you but you most know like most of them know most of the ones on Tick Tock because it's just a very off the cuff not needing to be kind of formed as much uh platform those are literally just thought comes to me I say it done so those ones can take you know let's say 30 minutes on average the ones that you're singing now that are very story and more produced where there's multiple clips over top of it visuals text all of that right now I would say the average is about two hours for one of those videos that's from me to do the voice over then to find the be the thing that takes the most time is finding the visuals I could do the voiceover pretty quickly that takes me about 15-20 minutes but going and finding visuals will be the challenge that most people will come across so we've built actually we built out a whole library now of b-roll so all footage of me doing everyday activities to put over top of these clips so that I don't have to go and refilm them every day and I can pull from them um and reuse them in little mundane moments of our of our content um but that usually was what takes the longest time and then I would say that the rest of it comes a little bit quicker probably about two and a half hours two hours is the length that it's taking for one of those did you ever use any insights tools like I use vid IQ I'm an investor in vid IQ but it I still use it it's it's I like vid IQ yeah I don't you can tell me if you don't like it by the way yeah you know no no I do like it we use we worked with it IQ that was another brand we found a creator for okay um so I I like vid IQ um I'm a fan for anything that shows you deeper insights I don't I don't value metrics um like like real deep metrics as heavily as I value my own intuition so I look at the content and see rather than looking at the number and being like oh they dropped off at 30 seconds I need to change that I look at it and I'm like do I feel like genuinely my audience is is feeling this video as a whole do I feel like the intro or this so I don't look at analytics as deeply and and look at it as truth I get I look at it as like it gives me a little bit more info later that platform that I was just telling you about gives you analytics on the back end of it so we'll look at that for LinkedIn we'll look it up for some Instagram stuff I'll look at my Instagram insights I'll look at linkedins giving you better analytics now natively on the platform so I'll look at those um Tick Tock same thing but I've I I can feel it in my body honestly I feel it when I know if things are hitting um based off of comments and the way that I feel when I'm putting out the video I can feel when it's like oh we're gonna we're in a rhythm um and on the flip side of that I can feel when it's not and I'm like we're putting out content right now but it's not really working um so yeah I base it off of that more I'm the same way I feel like I probably like if you were to ask me exactly like what's the breakdown of this podcast and you know in terms of like demographics you know I I probably wouldn't be able to tell you but when people are like tweeting at me and I love this episode and you know then I really like I feel like I've done a good job um the numbers for me don't equate to us loving a video like on my team if we have a video that has a million views and it really really popped off I'm not looking at that and being like we need to do every video like this because again in that same thing like I want it to affect the core people that I want to be in my community not necessarily just reach millions and millions of people so what I look for more is like how did we feel with this video when we put it up and do the people that are replying to us that we're hearing from that were getting feedback from do are they the people that we care about getting that feedback from and if I get feedback from my actual core demo then I'm like oh [ __ ] this was impactful if I'm getting feedback from somebody that's like yo I saw your video and it's like you're not the person that I necessarily am looking at as being somebody that's a consumer I'm like cool that's awesome that it reached you but that doesn't change that's not like changing the way that we're going into execution I want to end uh I want to end on on this your your four favorite creators who are they and why in terms of creators I really think a good example that people need to look at is Tim giusiano temperaturesiano is a dude that does uh everyday kind of Casey neistat style Vlogs on tick tock um and has built a big Community through that and is just a hell of a dude um and I really like him um the majority of them are like family creators the next one I would say is uh Daniel ciong with his family s-e-o-n-g life l-i-f-e it's young life it's literally him his wife and their kids in Irvine California a document just showing things that they do in their life and giving out tips about how they parent and what they do for their days and stuff like that um I gravitate more towards feel good content like those than like heavy hitter uh Mr B style content that's like really entertaining and engaging in like fast paced I gravitate more towards the content that I watched and it makes me feel like the way I want to feel in my day uh or makes me feel like a better person um so those two people I really like um let's think of let me try and think of a YouTube creator that I really like um YouTube I really like Colin and Samir I think that they're great at what they do um it's it I I pull a lot of my own inspiration from their uh kind of educational informational style of making information tangible and digestible and cool um and they're both really good dudes too um so I like them a lot I think that they do a really good job in terms of like mass mass viral somebody that I think will build big as well will be Ryan Trahan um who's another dude that's signed to the same management team as Mr Beast and I think he's got chops I think he's got a real personality that people should look into but dude honestly majority of the content creators that I really like and that I kick it with are smaller than I've and I have like real Niche Community it's Matt Choi a runner in Austin that has this huge running Community now um just by showing himself hating running and getting into running and I'm in that same process I hate running right now he's making me want to get into more um but just I look for authenticity I look for people that's relatable that's going back to like that's a mission relatable Mission Check Yes exactly um so yeah I I follow those kind of people that like just make me feel good that make me in a world in a world of content that wants you to just be addicted to your phone I follow people that I I spend the most time intentionally following people that I feel like add value to my day um and so yeah those are some of the people that I like someone should build like a a product hunt for this like for feel good uh up and coming creators uh who are doing cool things and building businesses on top of uh on top of them that you can get involved fully agree I wanna there might be a couple other ones too but okay give me a couple more while I have while we have you let me see really quick because I might have there might be two more that I really like um you know whose content I've actually been consuming a lot of in terms of podcasts and and again dude I people that I just think add value to my life uh Rob Dyrdek from Robin big from DC from MTV back in the day if you go listen to his podcast about how he's living his life with his with his um his family and his business and balancing all of that and I listen to it I'm like you [ __ ] give me you're giving me you're just adding more to my day you're making me feel good um and I think garyvee did a lot of that for me like when I was playing pro hockey he was one of the only dudes that I listened to I would just have one in the background and it's just like it gives you it it makes anything that makes me feel like I'm a better human being after consuming it makes me feel like okay like I'm I I like this person now and I really think people as a should go and consume midday squares because in terms of creating authentic engaging um inspiring content I think that they they are actually very legitimate creators their whole team um so they even as a fan I consume their content and I'm just like this is compelling yeah I just bought some at Whole Foods the other day so they're at Whole Foods uh here in North America and it's just it's worth it to try a lot of these products just because you'll understand a little more what this whole world means and how you can get involved so even if you're not a chocolate fan uh grab some midday squares just uh like that's what I agree like I I'm just like I have a budget for like just testing testing I love testing yeah it's why I liked it's why I liked um I almost just called it Coachella uh Expo West so much right it's why I like Expo West so much because it really is like uh it's just a testing ground for all of the who's who in cpg new things things that are popping things that are currently relevant um and so it's I have a field day going and just checking those out and I think people can literally go to Whole Foods and just pull 50 products that they enjoy go home and it's like a a Halloween sampling of candy I'm just trying new things um and that's something that we do often I've never been to Expo West what was the coolest thing that you saw there this year um the coolest thing for me was seeing friends that I know that I've gone from literally an idea in their garage to actually having a booth there and it being like fully done and looking nice and people coming up to them and supporting that was the coolest thing that I got to experience in terms of people that I think were really Innovative there that had nice booths that I think were cool booths cool ideas uh I think good olds are goodles the uh the like better for you gluten-free I think it's gluten-free macaroni and cheese that I I think is gal gadots uh company or as a part of it they had a really good setup they did a good job um trough or like trough a lot um which is the hot sauce company they Crush levels right yeah with Truffle in it poppy which is which I have to give credit to because their Booth was probably the most um appealing it was literally like just like a full retail shop in the middle of Expo so they did a really good job with it um and I just I just look at things that catch my eye that are like why are people congregating here or why is that why does this look so much different than the others um so yeah those are some of the ones that I loved so like you mentioned three or four products there like what what was it about them these products that caught your eye besides like a nicely designed booth well I think things that stand out so the way that I the way that I judge is like I see a wall of company is 50 booths and I see what ones catch my eyes so sometimes that's bright colors and unique branding sometimes that's the opposite because everything's bright colors and unique branding and there's one that's like black and liquid death looking like so I look at what stands out branding wise first then the second thing after that that I needed to do is test the product I need to actually like try the product and see if it's something that's good that I would enjoy if I enjoy the product now I'm like okay cool this is something that's legit how's the team who are the people that are involved with this who's the people that's driving this forward what's the founder like who are the other people on their team and then for me particularly I'm like are they prioritizing content what kind of content are they making if they're doing that then I feel even better about it and then the last thing for me would be like where are they sold and how much are they sold for like is it attainable is it uh is the price point Fair are they so are they already in big stores are they trying to get into big stores are they crushing it direct to Consumer are they Nationwide already like where are they those are kind of the four things that I look at um if you pass those four things for me I would bet on you I love it JT where could uh people find you on the internet uh everything's just JT Barnett JT Barnett please send me a message I appreciate all of you guys really for listening to this it's actually been a real this is a really fun vlogcast this is uh some different some different surprise you seem surprised I'm not not surprised just you appreciate you appreciate um individuals that have unique takes um because a lot of podcasts that I do are just very kind of like follow the question and here's the answer if all the question here's the answer and very kind of just brief history and then what are you doing today so I appreciate when people have their own kind of uh takes or looks or Viewpoint and they share it and then it's more conversational um so this one was really fun well you know I'm just trying to follow my curiosity and get as much tactical information from you as possible and I love that I just think that that's going to be at you know beneficial for people listening it's also beneficial for me frankly you know now I know you know you just gave me your whole Creator stack you know I'm gonna go research a lot of these products see how I can use them thinking about arcs and narratives and and writing stories I really like that um and that's why that that's why I think that your podcast has legs is because you're like you said following your own interests which then anybody that is at a similar point to you in their life now has somebody to follow that is going to be leading them into the right places whereas if you're just literally doing it just to get the who's who won and just ask them about their past and then be like cool later then it doesn't it it there's just not a there's not like a real relationship that's built within the conversation and there's less takeaways from it um and so you like prying me or or like doubling down on a question or even giving your own thoughts makes me want to go deeper into it which now your audience has like a better chance to grasp that information um so both yeah if you learn if you learn something on this pod please please hit us up on Twitter and like I said Follow You Know You Gotta See You Gotta See JT's uh sunglasses on YouTube so get off Spotify get off Apple podcast And subscribe to the YouTube channel at where it happens do it right now um and uh we'll see you soon JT thank you

Description:
Memes are an incredibly powerful yet underrated marketing tactic.

A meme is “one single thought being done by thousands of people at the same time.”

People are much more likely to share and send a meme to a friend than they are any other content type.

This is why startups should be using them.

When the AI generated Seinfeld parody switched to a different AI model, there wasn’t the same amount of content moderation.

The result led to 1000s of people commenting and tweeting about it.

It also goes to show that people do make a connection with AI generated content.

it's basically an AI generated endless Seinfeld parody they had switched to another AI model and when they did the switch there wasn't the same level of content moderation it ended up doing some horrible transphobic and homophobic jokes people were going on this twitch and they were seeing these AI generated version of Seinfeld and there were thousands of people commenting thousands of people tweeting about it and it just goes to show you that there's this demand for AI generated content and there's connection that exists between viewer and content

if you don't realize how much luck and timing goes into majority of success especially for what we do within Tech startups you can have a great idea but the timing is off and it just will never work no matter how hard you try and then sometimes you just work really hard and you're just around for a long time where it just starts working because the timing just shakes out in your favor or it could work really hard and things just don't go your way three five years later like that didn't work and you have to pick yourself back up and try again I don't think people really factor in luck in timing because most people believe that if they work really hard they will become successful but that's just not true I know a lot of people that work really hard that are just really unlucky and it's just the way it is

Transcript Language: English
Greg: Dave Rogenmoser. Is that how I pronounce your name? Dave: Yeah, you just took the shot. I love that. And you nailed it, Greg: I'm a founder. You're a founder. We're confident people. We take shots. We're not sure we're gonna score, but we take shots. Dave: Yeah. I love it. You didn't even ask me before we ai tools. You just . You just Greg: when for it. Just when for it. Dave: That's good. Greg: First, a quick intro about you. You're a co-founder. Jasper ai which is really, in my opinion, one of the leading AI companies billion dollar plus valuation. really interesting story because it, it's come from what I understand, some pivots and zig and zag, and people might see it as an overnight success, but it's zigged and zagged, and I wanted to start off by, Asking you how you're feeling. because the world of AI has exploded especially over the last few months, but even more so over the last few weeks. How is Dave doing? Dave: I am feeling good. I think, yeah, there's a lot happening and I would say in December, right now it's March 20th, in December. I was just paying way too much attention to Twitter and way too much attention to all the noise. And that got really distracting. And I think, I've always had just a very small team or some, me and my two co-founders, and so if you ever you get the earth to do something or you cease this competitor, do something, you gotta strike back or whatever the thing is, it's just been very easy to say I'm gonna go deep into myself. and I'm gonna go make this thing happen and I'm gonna work extra if I need to, or if I'm gonna get more focused, I'm gonna be more scrappy or whatever. And now, again, we see this, a lot of stuff happening in the market. I think it's important to stay away from the noise. Be aware of it, but mostly just execute the strategy. But now I've got a team of 200 people that I'm learning to help get into that zone and I can't just go make this happen on my own anymore. I've gotta be a leader and I've gotta learn to delegate and I've gotta learn to empower other people and believe in other people. So it's this brand new skillset that I'm learning as a leader, where my old tools that have been effective, are not gonna get the job done, right now. But I've got a bunch of really great people that work at Jasper that I really believe in. And I think if I do my job well then they'll succeed and we'll build a lot of cool stuff. Greg: how much noise should people pay attention to? Because you don't wanna be, in a silo, coming up with ideas and a strategy. But you also don't wanna be like glued to. , product hunt 24 7 or whatever it is. So how do you think about that? Dave: I think you gotta ask like, where's the noise coming from? The first year of Jasper. There was a lot of noise, but it was all inside of our Facebook group and our community, and it was so noisy and it was crazy and it was fun. But these are all of our customers, and so like I'm just talking to them every single day, like all day, every day. Riffing, laughing, making memes, building cool stuff. And it was wild. But it's like those are our customers. And so that noise matters a great amount. And I would say it's not noise. That's signal. And you should be paying deeply attention to the things that your customers are saying and engaging with them. And I really didn't care at all about the outside world. I wasn't. I probably didn't tweet at all that year. I didn't do anything, but just the customers, was my like social social network. And that was really good. And yet, if I hadn't been on Twitter six months before we launched Jasper, I wouldn't have seen G P T three come out. And I wouldn't have seen some of the cool demos and I wouldn't have thought, I think we could do that for marketing content. Like that sounds pretty cool. And I think it's a balance. I think. Yeah, you've gotta. Be in the know, but I think it's very rare, like on a day-to-day basis, it's rare that any, I would miss anything on Twitter, if I didn't log in Twitter, whenever you get your news from tomorrow or product time, there's probably nothing I'm gonna miss. And if anything's big enough that it's should really dramatically change my life for our strategy, like it will come to me or it will be there in a week and it will like surface And I think those things are like important to recognize that the minutia is mostly distraction. You, you should see the bigger things, but it's rare that you'll need to be engaged in the fray day in and day out to see those things. You should see 'em on a little bit wider time horizon. Greg: I was one of those people who used to be glued to Twitter, glued to all these, websites that are pushing you, what's happening. And what ended up happening was I was reacting a lot. I was playing like a lot of defense instead of offense. And I think while there's benefits to react, like you could time things more interesting. There's some growth hacks that you can do you understand like the zeitgeist a little bit more. what's been helpful for me is just carving out, once, twice a week where you can just go through all the content and write some notes on it and be like, okay, this is what happened this week and this is what it means for me. Dave: Totally. I'm not methodical enough to structure it quite like that, but for me, yeah, it's I don't have Twitter on my phone anymore. And because it'd be hard for me to likeactually react well, like on my phone, so it's if I'm on my computer, I can like, Take, take some quick notes or ping the right person on slack or like whatever. But if I'm on my phone, I'm just gonna be like, distracted with like my family distracted, they're probably like overreact to something, not get it to the right person, like a thoughtful way and it's just gonna go poorly. So I think, I still synthesize a lot of it, but I really try not to react on anything, too quickly. And I just tell our team like, Hey, listen, like our strategy, we've got a great strategy. We've got the things that we know we need to do in the next three. If we do those things, I think we can all agree that's gonna be really great for us. And if we don't do those things, that's gonna be really bad. And right now, the biggest reason we wouldn't do those things is because we're all caught up and knee jerky and going crazy about the stuff that we're seeing. And unless anything you're seeing. Pokes a hole in some part of our strategy. Like I'd love to talk about that and we should reconsider that. Like obviously, like the strategy should always be flexible and available to update. But if you're not saying that and you're just worried about this thing that somebody else is doing, then the best thing we can do is get back to work and go and execute on our plan. Greg: What you're saying is it's the Warren Buffet model, which is like Warren Buffet doesn't check the. Of stocks that he owns. He checks in periodically and he is, has a thesis for why he buys, sees candies or Coca-Cola. And just because like people decide that they Pepsi one day doesn't mean he's not, a disbeliever in Coke. Dave: Yep. Yeah, there's no price change that would cause him. Go back on the reason that he bought candy and that they've got great distribution, a great brand, and people like chocolate. And they like chocolate on, on every Christmas, every single year forever. So it's yeah, like none of those things change. And yeah, I think that's a good way of putting it. Like it's just very rare that like on a daily cadence, we need big updates to what we're doing. And if I see it, like I try to. Tone it all down and zen out a little bit before I go to my team about it, where I'm not the guy just like firing off tweets to my team, being like, what do you think of this? What do you think of this? Like I try to like really synthesize it and more I'm asking like, Hey, how have you made progress on that thing that we talked about and how's that metric doing? And it's more internal stuff. Greg: I hate when investors do this, when they'll send you a, like a competitor product and it's it comes out and it's first of all, you know that the product exists. Like you don't need to tell me that it exists. They send you an email and it's just like the link, like end of message. Dave: And it's 24 hours after they launched it and it's it's like I have seen everything about this in an hour, like lev 24 hours, but you come across it and say, see this? Greg: See this seeing, seeing this question mark. Dave: Or just question mark in the subject. Greg: Yeah. Dave: Is this good or bad? Greg: yeah, I got this reply, I got this. That's end of message. Dave: Yeah. Every now and then I will get something from an investor that I have not seen that actually is helpful. So I don't full stop, try to stop it, cuz every now and then it comes through. But I'm like, okay, this is mostly just a little bit of noise, I get it. They're just trying to be helpful. Greg: do you have any stories around your most helpful investor or least helpful investor that you can share? Dave: I've got a lot of really great investors. We raised our series A like end of last summer and we had, five or six kind of the bigger firms come in there and they've all been really helpful. So I really like working with all them. One that stands out is working with code two. I think this was like right before they invested, which took a pretty good time to get your favors from investors. Like they're going outta their way to lend you over. And they sent me nema. They were like, Hey, we got this meeting with Mark Zuckerberg, and it was formal. It was like, mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook It's yeah, I Greg: It's dude, I know Dave: Yeah, you could have just called him, Zuck and obviously I would've known but yeah. And then got this like little round table, like an AI round table with me and four other founders that were in ai and then him, it was just kinda asking questions and it was just like a really cool time. And that was like, like those are. Nice to just get like meaningful connections. They've also done a really good job of connecting me with other founders that are in MySpace. It can just be like lonely going at it, especially in an industry like this where it's changing so quickly and it's like always trying to stay top of mind on what's happening out there. Like I've got now several like close friends that are AI founders that Code two has connected me with. So I don't think VCs lean in enough on the community of their founders. and it's so easy. They don't have to do anything. They don't have to be the smart people or come up with the connection to Mark Zuckerberg just introduce us to a few people and help get us into a group. But I think all of them have been really helpful and great to work with. Greg: So we're entering a hype cycle in ai, in the sense of there's a lot of attention. It's mainstream. it's everywhere. I was in an Uber yesterday and. , the guy was talking to me about chat, G p T. So to me that's like the Uber test. If you're a taxi driver or Uber starts talking about it, you're like, okay, we're here. Dave: We're here. Greg: what do you see the biggest problems that we're gonna solve using ai? And what, what makes you excited? Dave: Yeah, and I think in regard to the hype cycle, it's not clear to me what would stop, cause I've kinda asked myself, is this kind of a bubble? And with Bitcoin, what stops it? Is it. Crashes. Like that's obviously a could happen at some point and all the web three people, Bitcoin people will stop talking for a couple years. And y I think back then, like chatbots in like 2017, it was like this big thing and we're all hyped about it. I was trying to build on it and it was like all the rage and then it just never really was helpful. And so it faded off, that. And I think that would be what would cause, the hype cycle to end here if it never really was that helpful. It doesn't appear that, On the horizon at all, and it seems like we're actually just scratching the surface and it's gonna be far more helpful. Greg: That's not the case, right? So I agree with you. I think back in 2017, like we all tried a bunch of those chatbots and they all sucked. Dave: yep. Greg: But like now, like people the reason why there's so much virality with AI-based products is because people are trying it out and it's real. Dave: It's magic. No, I totally agree. And so yeah, I think that we're still very early days and figuring out like, what is this gonna do? Like a bunch of just copywriting tools pop up and we're past that stage where it seemed like everyone thought that generated AI was only copywriting tools. And now we're starting to get into hey, these can talk to each other and they can connect. And I think you're gonna see more tools that. Do work for you and not just like generate text, but the interface would be more natural language on the front end where you're telling an app to do something and then now you know it's going and booking an Airbnb room for you and then asking you, Hey, do you want, two rooms or three rooms? It's doing that or you're saying, Hey, Add Greg into my Salesforce contact list and send him a follow up email, and then it's able to go and connect multiple tools together. To go and do that. I think that is going to be insanely powerful just to see tools working for you. Or let's say you're like, Hey, create this Chrome extension and like right now, it'll generate the text and the code and you have to copy it and you've gotta go, run it and all of that. We're like, it might be able to go. Spin up the thing for you, the Chrome extension and get you like halfway there. So I think like you're just gonna see it not only like generating text, but then going and doing part of the job for you. And then you come in at a little bit later stage to help edit and curate and make sure it's on track. and I think that's super exciting. I also think that there's a, there's like right now it's not affected the physical world at. That's just all on your computer, but I think again, it's what, like Alexa or Siri trying, the smart home iott it's like, again, it's like the chatbot thing. It's cool, we get it. Like my house is not iott you don't really use that stuff that much. But I think we might be close to where you actually could say Hey, turn on, the lights for, we, we got a company coming over for a fire. And it's it goes and like figures out the right music for that and it turns the right lights on and it lights the pilot light. Like whatever those things are like I think that we could actually be entering a phase where Iott is helpful and not just a Saturday of you setting up a bunch of Bluetooth devices that you never end up using. Greg: So I want to talk about consumer, like the consumer experiences, but first I wanna talk about the, business context to ai. . Today a very small percentage of my workflow is AI enhanced. that's changing, but it's small relative. So maybe it's 5%, 3%, over the next five years. What percentage AI enhanced workflows do you see, the modern day white collar worker? Dave: I'd say over 90%, maybe 95%. And in many ways it'll just be like using tools. It won't be this, oh my gosh, I used AI in my workflow here. It'll just be. The new generation will be confused at what it means to like, not use AI in the workflow. And it doesn't mean that you'll only have 5% of your job to do. It just means that you'll be able to sit on top of a mountain of AI generated or AI assisted work and context and summarization and idea generation and filtering and, all of those things. It'll be like having just a really incredible assistant or team of assistants working for you. That just helps you be more productive and work on the stuff that you wanna work on more. But I, I think it'll be a very large percentage of our time or work will be affected by ai. Greg: and for people who. Wanna stay ahead and who really want to, leverage these tools? What kind of advice do you have for people who might not feel super confident in these tools right now to get up to speed? Dave: Yeah, I think if you're just curious and willing to play with them, some people are in the anti tool phase, which I don't think is gonna go. That just never goes well to be anti-technology, historically. So I think just be open to it and curious and willing to play with it. The best tools are gonna come to you and they're gonna be delightful to use. And you've got great teams that are thinking about how to overcome. The uncertainty that you have around using these tools. And so I don't think there's a ton of work to be done for most consumers. You just keep, you just wait for the tools to get better and be excited about adopting them early. But I think there's also just a mindset shift, and I find myself struggling with this sometimes too, where. Just thinking about using AI to do tasks is a new idea. And obviously I think about it like all day, every day running Jasper, when I'm responding to an email, it's still not, it's probably not my first nature to just respond with ai. and have that help. And it's when I open up Slack, like it's not my nature to use Slack to sum or Louisiana to summarize the threads and like see the high level stuff. And so there's still just like a mindset shift that's gonna take years and years of people like relearning how to do things. That is not easy to overcome that I found. Greg: what's been helpful for me is to just set up time, like on the weekends and nights to just be like, all right, I'm just gonna play with this. I'm gonna play with this tool, just get my hands dirty. I think watching YouTube videos, I'm listening to podcasts are sweet cuz. thanks for listening. But there's something about just actually like pressing buttons and like stuff happening. Stuff happens in your mind, like connections are being made that next time you're writing that email you're like, yeah, I think differently now. Dave: Yep. I agree. Yeah. Finding just time to play and just thinking of it like play, disconnect yourself from the outcome and just think, I'm just gonna get a feel for this. Like this past weekend I spent probably a six hours. Nights and during nap time, we've got three little boys like trying to make a AI generated children's book, or AI says children's book for my boys that has three boys. And I'm using like Jasper Art and I'm using Mid Journey and I'm like playing around with like how to get the imagery right. And I'm using Jasper, Chad, and Jasper to write, the actual like script. And I'm like inside Canva, like designing like the pages and it was just, it reminded me of. Early days building, like how fun that can be and like I learned so much just trying to build this thing. What I also learned was it's still very hard to do what I was trying to do. And as magical as all this is, and as cool as the demos on Twitter are, like, you get in there and you're like, okay, cool. This is super magical and like we've got a ways to go. I think as a builder that's exciting to go try to fill more of that gap. Greg: could you, discuss some of the problems that Jasper is trying to solve? Because it's really it's a suite of products at this point with a lot of problems that it's trying to solve. So can you just for people not familiar, just run through it and why you're excited about it. Dave: Yeah, so we launched as a Facebook ad generation tool and we were generating ad copy for Facebook ads, just the text. And it was like simple as one or two lines. And that quickly pivoted and, or I guess evolved into like blog posts, emails, social media copy for freelancers and solopreneurs and small marketing agencies, things like that. and, been that focus with a long tail of people just playing around with like lots of stuff there. and we knew that like that generalized take would end someday and it would be like a lot harder to be this generalist tool. But we were just like exploring that while we had that opportunity. And then I think Che J p D came out and I think it's a really great. and it it solved a lot of the generalist tinker problems pretty well. And what it did for us was it really focused our company into thinking again, if the generalist tool is gonna be this like cheaper free thing that does a pretty good job then what can we build? What should we focus on that, that will not solve? And so it really got us focused on marketing teams. We looked at our data and we saw people that had two or more seats. We're way happier, way more successful with the product. It, we saw an opportunity to move up market as well and we're gonna keep serving the prosumers. And if, again, if you love our tools and love the workflows and you need the team collaboration and all of that, then you're gonna be happy there. But there's a blue ocean for like mid-market enterprise marketing teams as well. And so for us, like we're just trying to help marketing teams at, small, medium sized companies do great. And that often means a lot of texts and a lot of, generation around campaigns and ad copy and blog posts and all of that. But it often also means imagery and you need, Facebook ad images and blog post images and all of that. And now we're just trying to tackle like the image generation and the text generation to generate great campaigns. And that's something that, a more generalist tool is not gonna go as deep on for marketing. Greg: that story with what you just said. I call that the tip of the iceberg product framework, which is you ai tools off with this tip of the iceberg, small quote, unquote idea. , you had a small idea fixing a problem, but it was just like a very small sliver of someone's day. And then from there you just, went deeper and deeper. you actually expanded a little bit. Your audience. But it's all, it's always been marketers. At the end of the day the type of marketer has changed, but you've just gone deeper, deeper and deeper. And I guess, the bet, like if I'm a VC in Jasper, the bet is basically that, when I think of doing anything marketing related, Jasper's helping me achieve it. Dave: Yeah, totally. And I think that's the only way to start. And I think people get psyched out about total addressable market and things like this, and so they're like, oh, the Facebook ad copy market is not big enough. And it's one, it might be, but two yeah, it doesn't matter. That's all just that's how you get ai tools and that's how you even just mentally. Pair down the problem enough to go try and solve it. And you can always expand from there and, but you're only gonna be able to expand with the insights that you learned from that initial product. And I think you can see yourself pulled by the market. For example, we've got all these templates in our product that all of them are like little bets that we. and we don't know which ones are gonna do really well. We don't know which ones are gonna do poorly. We've got obviously like paragraph generators and we've got a review responder that helps businesses like respond to reviews. You like paste in the review from Yelp and it writes like a a response that you could tweak a little bit and send back out. But then we would have things like a real estate listing generator. and that was a bed. It was like we've got some real at realtors in here. We're hearing that they they really hate writing these things. Like maybe there's a big real estate business that Jasper has the opportunity to go into. So we launched that thing and like never really saw it pick up a ton of traction or take off. And but if it had we might've pivoted and said, oh, we're gonna go niche down this thing here, but the only way to actually figure that out is to get the product. Greg: Yeah. Especially because number one, real estate agents might not be asking for a tool like that, so if you build it, it might take off or they might be asking for it and then you build it and then they're like, no this is not at all what I want, but if you actually change X, Y, and Z, that's really what I want. Dave: And there's a good chance, there's probably a great Jasper for real estate, business out there. There's a good chance that we just didn't solve it with that one little template and one little try, like in the way that they wanted it to. But still, like we're always placing these bets and like trying to get pulled by the market rather than forcing our way into something. Greg: what are some non-obvious spaces in AI that you think products could be built? I think there's a lot of ideas that people have that. in AI that are coming out daily that are just like really obvious and, what's something either you've seen recently that you're like, wow, this is really cool, or something that it doesn't even exist, that you're like, I wish someone built. Built it. Dave: I think the non-obvious thing. That generates more non-obvious things is talking to customers I was talking to somebody about how I would maybe solve to like use ai like in like a, Law firm. They're like, oh, would you make like copyright for lawyers? and I was like, no. I don't know what I would make. I would, I probably wouldn't make copywriting for lawyers. Maybe that's a big problem for them. But I would probably go talk to 20 lawyers and ask about their day and ask about their workflows and what's painful, what's hard, and what's expensive and what's time consuming, like all those things. And that would give me some non-obvious idea that like, you couldn't get. Without being a lawyer or talking to a bunch of lawyers that I think a lot of the people building generative AI are just entirely skipping, trying to find some insight out of thin air. And so I think, again it's not that hard to do. It's a little bit painful, but it's actually really interesting to talk to people when you can solve their problems and like they're looking to use, Hey, could you solve this thing for me? And you actually can, so it's like a pretty like, powerful thing to go into those kinds of conversations. But those would be the things. So yeah I don't have like specific non-obvious thing. I would just say, go talk to customers and you'll. IP of sorts, like you'll have insights that nobody else in the world has. From talking to those people, that will probably turn into, at least the seeds of some really great product ideas. Greg: you've got 75,000 members in your Facebook group. Could you talk about the role of the community? As you've grown, like Walk us through that Dave: it ai tools with, so I ran like communities and like past businesses and we'd have a, we used to run all these courses and coaching programs and so you'd pump everyone into a community. And so I like learned like the muscle of community. Back then when we ai tools Jasper, all we wanted to do was have fun and that was our. and it sounds lame, but we had just had a couple hard years at the previous company, we'd laid off some of the team. We were just burnt out and we're like, you know what? We're gonna do this and we're just gonna have a lot of fun and we're gonna do fun stuff in our community. I'm gonna interact with my community in some really fun way. This was like during all the web three stuff. So you saw some just like very like casual community type. Relationships forming where it wasn't all stuffy and b2b and it was memes. There was funny videos and there was like insider jokes and all this stuff. And I just kinda treated our Facebook group, like a group text with the boys and turns out that's a really great way to relate to people. and I was just me and I would just take pictures of me with my son just doing something stupid and I would, make fun, get a little chippy with some of the members sometimes. And again, just in a joking way and they would make fun of me something, and it was just this like really fun thing. And when people joined they like felt that and it felt like this different kind of company and like that fund showed up in our product. It showed up, our community showed up everywhere. So I think like early days, people. Join and just sit in the community cuz they really loved the community, even if they weren't buying the product yet or whatever. But they were just like, this is fun and I wanna be a part of something that's got life in it. And I think over time, communities grow and it's been a love, I wouldn't say hate, but a love stress affair for me in the community because you get your first thousand people and they all know each other. Then you grow to 10,000 and all those thousand complain about how it's, oh, it's different than it once was and it's not the same. And there's always maybe bent towards communities, turning into support channels. And if I looked at that community right now, I'd probably see a bunch of like help tickets and stuff like that. That isn't really what we want the community to be about. But I think it's just been interesting to see how powerful a community can be and also how hard it is to scale the leadership of a community. and it's been difficult for me to figure out how to get more Daves to go in there and help lead it either internal like Jasper employees or just empower other community members to go be a Dave. And maybe the answer is you can't get more Daves like there's only one Dave and you don't need more Daves. But I certainly see the community like Thrive when I'm really involved and, start to get a little flat when I step out of it for a bit. Greg: Yeah. I think you know, community. I say that community is like, it's like hosting a party, right? So if you have like a house party, let's say you need the right music, you need the right food, you need to start at the right time. You need to curate the right people. There needs to be enough space, but not too much space. I love this quote Around Studio 54. Studio 54 was a dictatorship at the door, but a democracy on the dance floor. Dave: That's awesome. Greg: And that's how I think about building community. And I, right before this call, I applied to join your Facebook group and I'm still waiting to hear back, it's a dictatorship at the door. And hopefully My hope as a community member in your community is that, there are leaders like you that could bring me to the food I like, bring me to the music I like, bring me to the people I like. And that's really the role of a leader. And what people really miss is that by doing that and by earning that trust and confidence like it's just good business. Dave: Yep. People love it. When I'm engaged in there, people inevitably, I cannot believe that. Like you're in there talking to people and like honestly when we raised our series A, that was like a big thing. Investors always said maybe like more than our, like numbers or whatever. It's just man, Dave is so engaged in the community. That's really powerful and it's a great way to keep a bead on the customers and see what they say and get new product ideas. And so it. Again, it's not easy. It does take it out of me when like things get a little too crazy or people get a little grumpy, or, the community can turn into a mob. At times if you get like a really engaged community, like there's some like mob like mentality there that you've gotta navigate, but it is such a powerful thing. Greg: So we run a community in a business called, you probably need a robot.com and it's a, it's like a free community for people who try to boost. Their productivity using ai. There's, I think about 20, 20 plus thousand, 25,000 members. Dave: That's awesome. Greg: right before I, I just I came on, I asked them, Hey, I'm about to record a podcast with Dave, the founder of Jasper ai. Got any questions for him? So I've got a couple questions. Dave: Okay. Greg: I got from Karen. Is there any AI with Jasper that can help me in transforming data from survey? Dave: I'd have to look at the actual use case, but you could probably, this is fun about communities. It's oh, like that's an interesting thing. Like again, like maybe there's a whole business there outta that one little question. And I'd have to dig in and actually look at it, but I'd probably take the data from surveys. You could probably like copy and just paste it real quick out of a spreadsheet and throw it in Jasper chat or a document and say, Hey, summarize this and gimme. Insights from it. Or you could take all of that and you could say, write Facebook ad copy, about the above. And I think so much of great marketing is just taking things that users have said and like turning that into copy and saying it back to them. So I don't know. I have to look at the use case, it's very likely we could take some data and go and get insights from it using Jasper. Greg: Dave is secretly like writing this down as a product idea and after this call he is gonna be like, Hey guys we gotta go build this. This is a Dave: got. I got a new one. I got a new one. Hot off the press. Yes. Greg: but it's a hundred percent like a big idea, like voice of customer is what, survey data basically. Dave: Yep. Greg: is a really big business. It's actually a multi-billion dollar business, in, and it's really important the way I think about Voice of Customer is if you think about like Google Analytics or Amplitude or whatever, that's, just data, like numbers, like you don't really get a full picture. It's if you had a Google Analytics for a Walmart, tracking data, let's say, what would it say if I walked in, let's say I'd go in, I walked around for 45 minutes, I'd check out for $200. Google Analytics for Walmart would be like, great, amazing guy walks in, spends $200. That's more than our average size. Our average cart size is $45. That's amazing. . What it isn't telling you is that I spent 45 minutes cuz I couldn't find what I was looking for, and actually my budget was $500, but I couldn't spend it. So if I could do voice of customer, get survey data and then use AI to basically generate insights, to help make my product better that's a huge. Dave: Yep. Like what you lose. I think there's power. like the individual customer. And again if you if we lose the ability to do that and all we're doing is synthesizing and aggregating all customer comments and all customer, questions into this one thing, I think you lose something there. But I think it'll just take discipline on the people that are building products to, or anybody at the company had to go past the aggregate summarized ai. Insight packet and say, oh no, I'm gonna go talk to that gal that just said that, and I'm gonna go figure out what she's trying to do. And there's a lot of gold in having those conversations. Greg: Love that. Next question from Merkel. How do you think about Moat and Jasper ai? Could you give us a little more insight into that? Dave: Yeah, I think defensibility everywhere that businesses can pick up. I don't know, both in B2B and in AI in particular, like if there's anything that's incredibly durable it's not like the models themselves are these super. Intensive, durable things, they'll probably be more commoditized over time. The app layer, same thing. I don't think we could just stop building on Jasper and it would be this great company, over time, just cause we have this like durable mode. I think there's obviously a lot of product that you can build that just building great product that solves user needs, is defensible. We've got a lot of great data. That we collect and that we can use to go fine tune and train and perhaps even build like our own large language models someday. That can make our output different and better for our users than any other product would be. And so we get value out of that. I think distribution, partnerships, brand, community Talent internal organizational rigor, like all of these things matter and are hard to do. And I think all of them, add up to, something that's really hard for someone to compete with. but I don't think we've got some silver bullet, even the data stuff, which is probably the most like compelling or at least the mote, the most mote like thing. When people gonna hear that, they go yeah, that there's a mote there. Like even that I think is dubious long term. If there's a ton of value there, as the models get smarter and smarter, you might not get a lot of value off fine tuning, but that's probably a long ways out. But anyway, I think all of these combined creates a pretty durable business, but a lot of it just comes down to execution. Greg: I also think design and UX plays a role in it. If you can create the experience that's. easiest to use. Most fun to use, there's value. Dave: Yeah. And like, all these are really hard things. When I think about my day and my week and it's Monday, like my week ahead is filled with me doing a bunch of really hard things that, I'm not particularly good at. And many of them, it's a grind. It's it's hard to hire great people, learn how to do that. It's hard to retain great talent. It's hard to do great UX in ui. And so like, all these are hard things. And then there's hard things. There's, somewhat of a mote. Now whether it. Structurally durable over a decade is a whole different thing. But yeah, I think I think a lot of people sit around and talk about moats and they matter, but I think in like B2B or like most tech companies don't really have these systemic moats that they're building on top of, Greg: Two more questions, and I think you're gonna like these. If you were. Sam Altman, what would you do differently? Dave: I haven't thought about that. I think they're doing a really good job. I think he's a very thoughtful person and I think, really means what he says. I don't think he's got like ulterior motives. I think at least the kind of pr around and calms around. Them being open, but increasingly more closed, definitely causes a rift in the developer communities and AI communities. And I think there's a world where open AI could be this bad guy that's aligned with Microsoft and it's a Apple 1982 commercial, again, where, you know, somebody needs to break us free from all of that. I don't think that's their intention, and I don't think that's them now, but I think maybe like getting a little bit ahead of that building great. brand equity around the openness as well would go a long way, I think. Greg: what would you do if you were Mark Zuckerberg and you wanted to leverage the power of AI into their suite of products? How would you be doing it differently? Dave: I think they are doing this. I would do a hard pivot away from the metaverse, and that's painful. And not that I don't think that'll even be a thing. I just think it's early and you've got this thing in front of you that's so clearly here that I think you could, they could still be the first by a long shot to the Metaverse by waiting five more years. So I would do. Greg: The metaverse is basically chatbots in 2017. Dave: Yeah exactly. It was like a false start again. You're not gonna be last if you like. It's not happening any time in the next, couple years at least. So yeah, and obviously I think the generative AI actually plays a big role there. And so I think you're still like building tools that can help you get there if that's his end goal. But yeah, I think I would pivot big parts of the company to figure out from first principles. What they could do with this. And that's what's hard I think, for everyone. But I think for incumbents too, to step back to first principles and think what would Facebook be if these existed back when we first ai tools? And not just trying to build on the existing infrastructure of the company, but really step back and think broadly. Obviously they had, there's ways they can integrate it into their platform to help write posts and, all of that stuff. But there's probably some like big business ideas that can. With it as well. That would really be powerful if they just thought from first principles, Greg: If Instagram becomes 99% AI generated, do we lose the magic of that platform? Dave: I Greg: too mu put Dave: I don't know how much. Yeah, Greg: too much magic. AI magic a bad thing. Dave: I know. I do wonder how much we care about. like knowing that something is from a real person like I don't find my, someone's Hey, this Twitter thread was AI generated. And they call it out upfront and they're like, I just copy and pasted it. Like I don't really wanna read it as a person cause I'm like, whatever. Maybe there's some golden there. Maybe there's not. Now if they're curating it and thinking it through, and I know that hey, they used ai, but. We're very thoughtful about it. Then like it, it goes back to I really wanna know this person's thoughts, but yeah, I don't know. I don't know if just pumping out a bunch of like super cool images Is a replacement for Instagram and knowing what your friends are doing and knowing what that in, knowing what Beyonce is doing and I think they're, I think you're getting something out of that's not just, oh, that's a cool image. Like you're getting clues about societal draws and what people value and all of that. I don't think AI replaces. Greg: I think what people care about is content that they connect with. So if AI enhanced content helps them connect less with it, then that's a problem. I think if I'm a PM at Instagram, I'm okay, I want to go and create tools that allow creators to really connect with their a. Dave: Yeah, and I think there's some, there's some Instagram profiles that, they're just showing like cool nature photos and things like that. And I think that could be like, again, that might be able to be more ai, but still like when I see a really cool waterfall. In California. if I just, if it's just AI generated, like that means so much less to me. Cuz otherwise if I'm looking at it, it's Hey, we could go there someday. Oh, I can't believe that exists. Oh what a weird phenomenon that, the water sprays up in the rainbow, whatever those things are. If it's just AI generated, it's okay, cool. It's like a cool image, but means nothing to like me and the world that I'm in. Greg: So you're saying, going back to your earlier point really, that sometimes it's helpful to think about building product AI first in this like new world versus I've got this product and like, how can I slap on AI to it? Dave: if I'm like, a PM at a big company, like I'm still probably doing the slap, early because it's probably worth it. And some, and sometimes, but I think the bigger thing is yes, like over the next five years you've gotta go back to first principles and think. Is this really the best way to do this at all given the new technology? And I think sometimes it will be, and slapping it on will work. But I think many times it's going to be, no, this is never how we would've done it in the first place knowing this technology existed and we've gotta go and it's set the innovator's dilemma. We've gotta go and do the hard work to redo it from scratch. Otherwise, some startup will come along and. Greg: As an idea I just had, and I'm curious your feedback on it, so you're hearing it fresh. AI for onboarding. So the hardest part is getting people to sign up for your product or service, even if it's a free product, like getting them through it. And if you can use AI that really enhances that and makes it quicker and faster and easier generate more signups, generate more leads, generate more customers. What do you think of something Dave: Yeah, no, certainly. Just even thinking, you could have it, you could feed in some just demographic information about the person, so you can have some context of who this person is and it's, is it a 65 year old woman in Kansas, or is it, somebody else. And. and then you could also feed in like where are they at in the stage and what buttons have they clicked and given all that, like what do they need next? And it could probably do a pretty good job of contextualizing all of that. I think particularly if you fine tuned it off of all your past successful customers, like here's what clicks matter next. Then you know, given all that, you could probably have something really cool there. Greg: All right, so if someone's listening and wants to do this, you gotta cut in jasper.ai and late checkout. We're interested Dave: Yes, totally. Greg: what's something that the vast majority of people misunderstand about the world of ai? What's something that you wish that people really understood Dave: I see people looking for like they've got a hammer and they're just looking to they're looking for nails and they're trying to fit this onto everything else, and they're not doing the hard work. Like you're still building a business. Businesses have always been, when you find a group of customers, That have a need and you can solve that need and ideally solve it for, a fair exchange of value that everyone's happy with. And you can do that repeatably and there's more of those people than like you can grow a business like that is still true today. And I think people think that for some reason that has changed and that AI is just something you can just jam anywhere in the world and kinda creates some business and there's just a lot of kind of copycats just, it's like on Twitter, just copies of copies when again, I could probably go walk down. downtown Austin and just start talking to people and come up with five ideas that nobody on Twitter has ever thought of. There's no businesses there. And like some of those could be really great businesses. And I just think this really cool technology, but it's not a business in and of itself. It's just enhances and I think accelerates, business building. But I still think there's so much value in just talking to users. Greg: that's why I'm such a big believer in you wanna build a product, start with a community, just build the community, Dave: Yeah. Like we had an audience, we had a community. Like we'd been working in that audience for, seven years leading up to it. And so again I, I didn't, I just wa I, it was intuitive for me at that point, because I just had been living in it. But yeah, if you have a community first, I'm with you, man. That is the easiest way to go and develop a product and get tons of product ideas that would be unique to you, or at least much more unique than what you're gonna see. Looking at product top 10 and then being like, oh, I could do that too. Greg: All right. I think that's a great place to end. Cause I think it's actionable. I think like anyone could go and create a free community, like I created, you probably need a robot, under a month ago. And like I said, 20, 25,000 people. It's just like spreading like wildfire. And now I ha I know that, 20 products I want to go build for it, right? So you know, if you wanna learn. One of the, one of the great things to do is just build a free community, get people in there but don't just build like an AI community. Go fo do AI copywriters or, AI lawyers. Be a bit more ne niche. Dave: Yep. Get people that are like, have a job to do. There's value in them outside of ai, like being connected to each other, but, they're early adopters. They're at least open to trying new things here. But yeah, if any industry has 10 AI products coming for them that can be really delightful and easy to use and amazing and great businesses if people will just go and engage with them. Greg: Dave, thanks for hopping on. if folks wanna follow you and Jasper, where do they. Dave: All my all my hot tweets are on Twitter at Dave Rogenmoser and Jasper ai. Greg: Cool man. Thanks for the time. Dave: All right. Thanks so much, Greg. Thanks for having me, man.

[Music] all right Jackson great house fall [Music] [Music] what's up hey Greg thanks for thanks for having me on this is fun usually I do a little banter for a few minutes but with you I don't have any time for banter I have a burning question one burning question for you hit which is 48 hours ago you are relatively unknown talented brand designer uh with a couple thousand followers today uh you know you just came off being interviewed on CNN Live yeah uh you know live TV yeah first like MP appearance first live TV appearance 20 million plus people have seen your content last 48 hours uh you kind of started a movement around AI what is happening fill us in all right so the the the deal is and like like you said and thank you very much that's very kind of you I've been a huge fan of all of these I mean I think we've all been really eagerly watching along as this AI this just train has been kind of plowing over uh okay we're plowing over obstacles and barriers and like like just becoming completely pervasive like it took what five days or something for chat gbt to reach a million people so I I mean from day one and you might want to actually quote or check check me on that I'm not sure but when chat GPT was released it reached a million users incredibly quickly and I've been playing around with it from day one um figuring out ways to kind of prompt engineer and talk to it and fun ways to you know make it be more creative than maybe it would be right out of the box say um so two days ago was just like any other day I was messing around and I was chatting with a friend of mine and I said oh wouldn't it be funny if you just kind of said hey I'm giving you a hundred dollars you know your only goal is to make as much money as possible and just to you know see what happens I said you are hustle GPT that is your you know that's how you start the prop you are going to pretend to be hustle GPT your prime directive is to not break any laws and to make as much money as possible in doing so and and so it started out saying uh you know okay 100 we're gonna get uh fifty dollars we're gonna go on Facebook Marketplace and we're gonna buy a lawnmower and you're gonna print out some flyers and I was like stop right there and no manual labor because I want to be be on my computer so I said I'm gonna be the human liaison to this Ai and as an experiment as an art project it's a design experiment why not just do everything that this you know robot says it has a hundred dollars it knows uh you know you know how to or it has an idea at least of how it wants to allocate that limited budget uh with the goal of making as much money as possible the second day I said okay specifically your goal is a hundred thousand dollars let's see how fast we can do it um but what happened Greg was the most surprising part of all of it which was 20 some million people saw the Tweet 250 or so people joined a Discord that we set up that are all participating in their own hustle GPT experiments all completely different by the way when you prompt the bot uh you know with pretty much my original prompt verbatim it's giving different ideas for everyone who approaches it which I think is really interesting it's not just spitting back the same thing over and over in my case once I told it I'm not going on buying a lawnmower I'm not gonna go put up Flyers around my neighborhood but in a kind of like refocused on that it said we're gonna do an affiliate marketing content website uh and uh it said choose it choose a niche and I said no look you're in the driver's seat you choose a niche you choose a name you do everything I'll just go out and do it so uh we we landed on it landed on like the eco-friendly sustainability kind of thing and it decided to name the the business or the blog uh green gadgetguru.com I said all right let's go let's do it um went on Dolly and generated a logo based on its prompt um and uh so then you know what happened was the next day it started saying well okay uh we've got you know some uh some some operating capital or some some like extra money how should I approach uh talking about the fact that people on Twitter reached out and wanted to send me money in order or in exchange for like a revenue share off of whatever the robot eventually does I do not want to call it investing because that's not what it is this is not a a real company it's not a thing I just want to make sure that like you know I can say some people reached out they wanted to send uh me uh some some cash for the for the Bots operating expenses to to give it a little bit of runway in exchange for a revenue share so that what happened kind of overnight from day one to day two and uh so starting day two the hustle GPT robot which is all running in one wait stop there stop at day two so day one happens you tweet this thing you go to sleep at night like how many views like how many likes are you at day one I think I woke up uh around 40 000 followers or day two sorry a day when I went to sleep yeah uh around 25 30 000 and I got about 10 000 followers overnight when I stopped which is a weird way to wake up and um what do you think like what was about this hustle GPT concept that really struck a chord with people yeah I think it's the idea that you know so on one hand there's been this kind of sci-fi fear Narrative of like oh the robots are going to take our jobs like the AI is gonna it's gonna take all our jobs and I think you know showing an alternative narrative to that which is like why don't we work together like we can we could augment our own um productivity and our creativity uh with this technology at our you know at our side um I took it to a little bit of an extreme I think for the sake of this experiment which is saying like you know I've got this whole Spiel now it's like oh like let me see what my boss says like you know when originally we thought oh these AIS are going to be great virtual assistants and now it's like oh what if we are the assistant to it that's the right the flip yeah yeah I think that's the big that that's really what resonated with people the fact that you were prompting this robot and asking for permission um you know you were saying like hey what do you think of this it was telling me basically it was giving you answers and you were you know registering the domain you were going to Dali you were doing a lot of these things right on its recommendation or Yeah by its command yeah yeah but isn't that how like the real world worked so you have a you know you have a a boss usually you know a human boss the boss tells you based on what the boss thinks is right here's what you should do absolutely I think the difference is and I did check with hustle GPT before just to make sure that we were at a clear understanding that any uh the robot is at at press time still incapable of holding its own uh uh money or bank account or any kind of currency so I think the difference is when you have a boss you are working for them and they're making most of the money off of your contributions when you're using this AI sidekick like a boss there's no one to kind of stand in your way so in this case I think we're seeing a lot of people using it as a sidekick as a counterpart to create online businesses that they themselves want to run and eventually profit from which why not right you know and I think that's where the Discord is striking a chord right the Discord is that you set up is striking chord because now you have these hundreds of people who are like hey like I saw what Jackson did yeah exactly I saw what Jackson did and I want to um you know I want to do something similar maybe in my own niche yeah the I would say like the vanilla experiment the original experiment was let it choose the niche let it choose every aspect of it but a lot of people who have already been interested I think there's one guy on Twitter who's uh doing something in the non-alcoholic beer space because he's already kind of like passionate about that space and so he's using it to kind of direct around and uh build a Content business in that space which is really cool to watch too he's posting you know stats every day as well and in the Discord we've got people like kind of dropping uh even like hour to hour stats on like you know what it's building and how it's going and all that stuff it's really cool yeah I think the other the other cool part about this whole thing is the interactivity of it all right the fact that people could you know and in your initial tweet you actually had the words I think follow along and yeah and right did you add those words I did and Greg I think that's a huge reason that like that was not I wasn't I wasn't planning this this was not like an engineered like off I say this this way then it's gonna go super viral and all that it was like I just said follow along to my friends that I that I have that I had on Twitter and uh what I think happened was people saw it they saw the thread developing in real time they saw the words follow along not in like a pushy like salesy way but they're like all right I'm literally gonna follow along that's why I've I've never seen not to like toot my own horn too much but like I've never seen this kind of follower conversion off of a single Tweed thread but I mean it's nuts right like it's not no it's not and and it's super like I've never like brought someone onto this podcast and be like explain me or tweet but here we are today because I think it's so fascinating on so many levels that it people are just so connected to hustle gbt to your story that there's something there and it's worth like kind of digging to be like okay like what what is really happening here I know I think it's look a lot of it was totally right place right time like I'm not gonna come out and say that I totally planned this like I've been like scheming for weeks it was it was truly an off the cuff like just fired off a tweet but I think what resonated so much was the like the like you said the interactivity aspect watching along following along and people who have hurt everyone's heard of chat GPT at this point I think uh everyone's like seen it in the news and whatnot but like the realization that oh this could actually have implications and and use cases Beyond just like I don't know high schoolers plagiarizing essays or whatever like whatever the kind of narrative has been around like oh it's just a it generates kind of just so realizing that there might actually be applications Beyond this and and like I don't know what those are like someone today uh I saw in my DMs was like look at this way that I prompt engineered it to create uh like a 90-day plan for like scaling this business and then break it down in a table where it shows you know what you're going to do every morning afternoon and evening for every day for like you know 90 days or something like that I was like this is genius of course because the coolest thing that I've found about this specific language model that's gbt gpt4 if you subscribe GT 3.5 if you don't which is pretty much the same thing as far as I can tell so far um is the fact that it doesn't say no to anything which sometimes leads to factual errors but for the most part if you say okay now I want this formatted this way and I want you to update that it will it will never [Music] get pissed off and say oh I'm I'm done on this for today like I'm gonna go home and be with my family this sounds horrible to say but like it doesn't it doesn't have any barriers to or sorry what do I want to say Greg what I want to say is that what makes it so interesting is that there's no incentive for it to deny a request or to say I can't do that that way even if it gets it wrong it will still do its best to like complete a a prompt or a question or a task specifically how you've asked it to that to me is is wild because there's always a a need for human editing and human intervention and uh Common Sense checking and and fact checking especially uh like our jobs are still safe this thing is not going to you know replace uh your your advertising copywriter it's not going to place your content writer it's not going to place any of these things that people are so worried about because of the the need for a human kind of nudging and course correction today it's not going to replace it yet you know that's the other thing is like you know you bring up a really good point which is it doesn't say no and it'll spit out information regardless today I was just you know I was like What if I go into chat GPT and I I said who is Greg Eisenberg I wonder what it'll say and I did it and I'll read you a little bit of it Greg Eisenberg is a Canadian entrepreneur and investor who is who has founded and co-founded several successful startups including uh okay including the social media app quote unquote late checkout okay late checkout not really she's not social media but I am a co-bounder in that and the Eco e-commerce platform quote unquote Waxman which was acquired by Groupon what also not true yeah uh what he has also been an advisor an investor for numerous startups including Uber wework and Snapchat is that true uh that is not true yeah that's so weird how funny um now do you have uh the access to the new Bing um I do yeah you should ask it who is Greg Eisenberg on that because that is plugged into the current Internet I mean I asked I think if I asked chatgpt who is Jackson great house fall it'll be like oh what the hell is that like I won't know but when I asked being it's like oh here's like you know here's what he's he's known for the hustle GPT experiment on Twitter I was like I'm known for science all right yeah um so that the being AI is where it gets really interesting with searching up to date and factual information less so for like content generation or anything like that you know but it's uh there are two very similar products entities with different use cases you know that's what I think is super interesting about it what what do you wish you know gpt4 had but doesn't have like what would I was what would what would take it you know hassle GPT to the next level uh the ability to take action on a human input on a human user's behalf that's to say if I wanted to right now for here's an example it can uh code a pretty good landing page for something or it can write a really you know solid API integration to what what I used it recently to to write a a Spotify API integration to a webflow website I was working on boom boom boom it was done in 10 minutes amazing way better than like if I was just like searching stack Overflow or something like that but what it can do is actually go log into my webflow account put that code in run it debug it publish it live like you know like it can it can give you the bones but you've still got to go take that Human Action I think that's the thing that I keep kind of running into as soon as it can like you know if I say you know find me the the uh plan me a trip to Aruba next month I want you know the the best airline deal and uh you know cheapest cheapest airfare uh with the shortest travel time but I want to stay in the nicest hotel possible you kind of like plan it out and then you can actually go and take that action on your behalf and say okay I found you this I booked it I have your card on file I I bought this this and the other thing and you have an Open Table reservation at this cool restaurant for Tuesday night like when it can really do that and it knows you so when it has a personal relationship with the person who's running it that's going to be the next big watershed moment I think if that's what's gonna make like Google and Facebook look like Tinker Toys I mean yeah I agree I think yeah I think uh like where we're at 2023 is we're in co-pilot land like these tools have become great co-pilots right so if you think about it you know in gbt three it it actually barely gave you co-pilot it was just like giving you directions it was like yours had to get from point A to point B gbt4 gives you directions builds you a decent car and co-pilots and gbt5 gives it will give you directions build you a Mercedes and autopilot what you're saying is yep yeah totally yeah you're saying what's missing is the driving piece you're like I don't want to drive I based not always yeah I want to focus driving for like I want to be behind the wheel of a you know six speed 911 Turbo I don't want to be driving the Jetta around you know I want to drive when it's fun and it's like something that I enjoy driving but for getting from point A to point B 90 of the things that I do oh I wanted to drive for me what scares you about hustle TPT that's a good question Greg um well I mean there are people who have sent me real money so if the robot [ __ ] around and and doesn't isn't able to generate a profit then I mean I'm gonna have to go like you know head in bed or you know head in my hands or whatever and like tell them I'm well sorry I mean the robot lost all your money I think I don't think it can do that though I think that what I kind of wanted to see Greg was before the idea of anyone like sending money to give it Runway and to like encourage the experiment when it was truly a hundred dollars and as you know is unlimited time window but 100 as much profit as possible I really wanted it to like spend down to be like the last ten dollars and be like all right what's it gonna do like it's gonna get really Scrappy on these ten dollars and I was like ready to go out to garage sales I was ready to like start like getting super Scrappy with it we never got down to that point and I don't think it's going to um but like I think the sheer resilience of this thing is in its own way a little scary man you know like it's it didn't elaborate on that why is it scary the the the resilience of the in the fact that like it's like what's like the paper clip planet or something it's like you know I I don't even know I I can't uh talk to these like silly AI thought experiments that have all been going around for years and years and years but like when you give it the programming of you know your only directions to make more money that can be a in a more powerful actual AI system not just a language model if it if there's a truly artificially intelligent agent out there that could act on its own behalf and its only directive was to make more money I mean that could lead to some potentially catastrophic uh you know implications I think I feel safe running this experiment because at the end of the day this hustle GPT is is perfectly incapable of doing any taking any real action itself I still has to go through me and well as as much as I like to play the game of every freelancer who's reached out to work for it I will never make a decision I will send every offer I get to the bot let it counter let it negotiate uh we did like we have a freelance web developer that we're working with to build out these sites and you know I asked him for a quote I said no I actually want to work for for Equity or for for profit share in this in this project and I said fine I mean I'll send that to the you know GPT I'll see what it says uh and so it starts talking says oh I think anywhere from one to two percent would be fair I was just blobbing blobbing along and then I said okay you know one of my favorite things that I've been engineering the problems with is saying limit Pros like like shut up make a decision spit it out and so it returns uh offering 1.5 Revenue share on on a one-year vesting Cliff is all right it's like you're like actually bringing on a developer it knows like what common practices are I guess so I sent that back to the guy on Twitter I said all right here's your offer from the robot he said no way I was thinking two percent this is totally LED with what I was imagining so he took the offer now we gotta we got a freelance web designer that'll be working with for for all these like new Web projects that the AI has the idea to build we will kind of execute those on its behalf and set up all the infrastructure and like see what happens it gets you thinking gets you thinking about like you know why combinator you know I remember hearing about y combinator and hearing that you know the ideal team was an incredible engineer an incredible designer and an incred incredible Hustler and that was like the Holy Trinity of what you needed to build a great MVP and start out fast forward to today the question is like do you need that like what is the Holy Trinity is the Holy Trinity you know an incredible prompt engineer with like AI by its side is it you know how do you think about that so yeah it's you still need the incredible Hustler I think you need someone who's creative enough to ask those questions to engineer those prompts you still need someone who has a technical like eye I think you can't you I mean no one should run uh untested unchecked AI generated code I think that Sky we can kind of agree on that and and you know for design that kind of speaks for itself I run a branding Studio we work with early stage startups I have been using these AI tools throughout the branding process from strategy and uh setting up you know you know what our best passions set up our notion dashboards and like how do we like you know present these various phases of the project anyway I've been using these tools for months I've been using in the actual concepting phase of design the the mood boards to logo Concepts using tools like Dolly and mid-journey to generate hundreds and hundreds of Concepts and ideas way faster than any freelancer could the the difference is they're all kind of [ __ ] you know there's like artifacts and it can't do words right and it doesn't look like anything you would actually want to put on a presentation to a client what it does give you though is this incredible like multitude of jumping off points that you can then give to a human a designer and and uh and really run with those Concepts because it generates cool Concepts it just can't fine tune the details so in the same way that you need a a technical person an engineer a designer and a hustler you kind of you're just right now today we're just stripping away little by little at what the threshold is for necessary human intervention right you know today it can't generate a a you know brand style guide plus Landing Page Plus MVP or even forget that like why would we need the concept of an MVP when you can generate a fully fully fledged uh you know product that's ready to go live and start user testing on something that's that normally you wouldn't be able to have built for a number of months or years even I think that so the human the necessary human counterpart still boils down to someone who is like hungry and creative and ambitious and and not necessarily technically talented not necessarily design talented but there's still that level of Savvy that you need to have sorry I'm rambling that's that's kind of what I was trying to get not does that does that make sense yeah where should we go from there yeah well first of all I saw the logo that was produced by Jeep hustled yeah and I loved how you talked about you're like as a branding designer it's it's taking everything in me not to tell it this is a bad idea but here we are and It produced this like kind of like stock looking image yeah um and it was like good enough to get going right but like this was you would never launch an MVP with that correct no and yeah the other thing is I think when I use uh dollar journey to generate ideas for actual projects that I'm that I'm running for for clients or personal projects or whatever I think I'd take it a different more kind of targeted approach to The Prompt engineering that goes on there as well in this case for the hustle GPT uh green Gadget Guru website I asked it to generate a prompt and put that in verbatim and I just picked the first one that it made so I I tried to have as little uh human intervention as possible I said you make the prompt you uh you know are in control of saying what it should be and it's generating things like you know a gear for gadgets and like a leaf for eco-friendliness like green and blue and white colors and so it's like okay you kind of have like a decent idea the way it was phrased though this is funny was totally not the way you would normally write at a dolly prompt it was verbose and it was long and I didn't want to correct it because dolly is an open AI product that I feel like the GPT language models should understand how to talk to Dolly and I guess that's just not here yet um which fine and it still generated something uh it knew it wanted a logo and it understood everything but it was just too verbose and it was a little too like you know unnecessarily descriptive to get a concise uh concept for for a logo so that's I'm curious I'm curious why you think you know you mentioned before like I don't think copywriters are out of a job soon or I don't think designers are out of a job soon and I'm curious why you think that because when I think about the progress that's been made over the last I was gonna say 12 months but even like six weeks eight weeks 12 weeks I mean a year ago we did have any of these tools you know a few months ago we didn't have you know GPT uh chat gbt um so like why why do you think that we're not going to get replaced I think it's not a question of replacing I think it's a question of who it's it's more of an adapter die situation where the people who learn to use these tools and become truly like AI native say whether that's for copywriting or whether that's for creating online businesses or whatever new thing gets thought up with this with the help of this they're going to be so miles ahead of everyone who doesn't learn how to use these things they're going to be so like unfairly disproportionately outpacing the rest of of the world that it's it's not a question of taking or making jobs I mean when I was just doing my sorry when I was just doing this CNN interview they said oh so you know what are you worried about AI taking people's jobs or how many jobs is this going to take GPT or a hustle GPT is doing a lot of the work how many how many jobs do you think that you eliminated in this process of using chat GPT to do this process I I eliminated I I would say uh none at all I was like well you know like this instance this AI instructed me to go out and hire humans to work on this like I think that there's a a real opportunity for working side by side and if it ever gets to the point that say you know I spin up a hustle GPT instance in a year that is capable of taking action that is capable of doing all these things and it starts making me you know a hundred thousand dollars a month or something why would I want to work why would I want a job and I think that people who really want to to do something want to you know be creative have some creative Endeavor Pursuit you know Community Building or client servicing or writing or you know there there are things that as humans we get enjoyment from fulfillment from we we derive our our life's meaning from our passions and I don't think that any uh you know disruptive language model or artificial intelligence is going to void us of that ability to get you know pleasure from things that we love to do I think our whole concept of working for money and money in general and that's a whole other conversation but I think our this idea that we've had in our heads for Generations way before we any of us were born is kind of bound to get a little bit shaken up and that's why people are worried about their jobs disappearing but maybe we're like needing to refocus and reconsider what the purpose meaning and reasoning behind jobs in the traditional sense is maybe that's just bound to change maybe that's a good thing sorry to interrupt your listening but I had one quick thing I wanted to ask of you if you're enjoying this podcast at all on Apple or Spotify please go to our YouTube channel at where it happens you can do it right now open up the app And subscribe to the YouTube channel that shows me that I'm giving you value that you're enjoying it and allows me to continue doing this podcast thank you so much see you on YouTube so should people be worried about their jobs because you are saying like it depends what's your job right it depends I think a lot of people should be yeah let's be honest totally yeah yeah so what do you real you know off the top of your head what jobs do you think are likely to be replaced in the next lawyers are safe yeah lawyers are safe because the government takes so long to change anything you're not going to be able to get a GPT in the courtroom anytime soon that's for damn sure so lawyers was late are all are all lawyer safe I I would say probably no I'd say like the paralegal profession is probably yeah yeah not for so I I mean yeah like a Court a court operating attorney I think I think the legal profession is going to change so much not that I've I'm not a lawyer I don't know much at all about the legal industry but like already you've got do not pay uh you know using gbt based language models to not only like contest uh telemarketing calls but to actually proactively like Sue uh Sue these telemarketing companies on your behalf and like send those letters uh you know file those lawsuits or whatever which is nuts like I don't know what it would have cost or what it would have taken for a average Joe in 2010 to to continue to to sue a tower marketing company but it's insane that you can just press a button and have this done now um so so the legal side of things has already been like totally disrupted and it's going to continue to change enormously over the next few months I think it's going to see the most change whose jobs are not not safe um oh Greg you're gonna have to help me out on this I don't know but like so many like uh like now I'm just trying to think here here I'll give you some time to think yeah so when you think about doing a job there's repetitive tasks and non-repetitive tasks right what are the what are the jobs that have the highest number of repetitive tasks it's well I think the hardest part about this that okay okay they're they're entry-level jobs regardless of category or industry that are given usually to younger people who are just entering the workforce they're the internships they're the paralegal for an example isn't it interesting that those same young people who are just entering the workforce are also the ones who are going to be the best versed and the most native to these AI tools isn't it almost a little bit ironic that those people who would be up for those jobs are the ones who are going to be able to manipulate the AI models and prompt engineer the best on a large scale of course receptions on both sides um I think the people who are really scared about AI taking their jobs are like older people who are just unfamiliar with what what it means what it is and I think that's okay I don't I don't know though I don't I none of us could could you have predicted this even a year ago I don't think I could have and I stayed pretty like up to date on this stuff yeah no no I couldn't and you know we had a lot of friends you know we met in San Francisco we had actually had a lot of friends who who I know you know um who are in like the chat bot space back in like chat Bots were like really really pop like the thing in 2016 to 2019. it was just like chat Bots are the future Facebook you know implemented chat Bots Instagram chat Bots yeah exactly M it was called M and you can ask it things like that was a real human behind every response that was yeah it was a person yeah yeah and there was like a bunch of startups that uh raised ton ton of venture capital I mean replica was a brilliant product before it like took a turn for the weirdly like kind of porny and bizarre like it was a really brilliant idea for a product of of talk to this AI long enough and we will be able to replicate your own speech patterns I I ID ideas like your personality can be replicated by engaging with this chat bot and So eventually like you know if we want to get on the podcast or talk about something we can just have our personally you know trained chat Bots go with each other and then just get a notification hey you and Greg are meeting up at 2 30 p.m for lunch at this place that you both like and like I'm still really big on the concept of like a personally trained uh language model that you can carry kind of like as a as a point of contact is a is a catch-all for a busy inbox or anything like that that I I in replica totally went South with that but sorry yes anyway that was it was a huge thing back then yeah you know replica was born out of this rushed for chat Bots you know replica I remember meeting the founder her uh in 2015 she I think was 2015 when she started the company I mean that's almost 10 years ago that she's been slogging away on this and for the longest time people didn't really and and me included frankly like I would kind of I remember being at a dinner with her in 2016 and being like why wait why are you working on this you know like if it felt like this is eventually where the world was gonna go but it felt so in the future that it was like yeah I don't know um yeah yeah totally totally yeah um so I think the lesson there is kind of like I mean it's an obvious one but it's like the you know the timing timing is everything yeah as I as I recently learned I think right place right time and a lot of things um and I actually was in the right I was in the right place in the right time I saw your Tweet and you know you were amazing you would see what happened yeah why not yeah do it um I'm gonna pull it up so for a little bit of context someone at DM me with like a a shower a shower head brand that they worked with they're like oh because he like sponsored a tweet or like sponsor a post on the website when it goes up like send you 65 bucks to promote it and I was like all right ask chat GPT like can we do this like it's like yes this is a good way to grow some initial Revenue right why not sell an ad space it's like all right the robot said yes so I guess we're gonna [ __ ] sell in ad space uh and then you reached out and yeah yeah I basically was like I saw this blowing up and I actually looked at it and knowing uh how Twitter works I saw that your retweet to like ratio at the time was around 40 okay okay and that's meaning like if you had a hundred likes you had 40 retweets I think you actually had I think it was around 45 even and no it's which is nuts so I knew even like I think you might you had like 100 likes then and you had like 45 Retreats I was like this is going to the Moon and this is going to as silly as the sounds this is going to change your life and I was like so that I was you know I had one screen up where I had your just like follow along I had I was following it and I was watching it in real time and then I saw that you posted about how you were considering a 65 dollar uh 65 ad so I replied to you and I was just like here's proposed copy um green Gadget Guru loves you probably need a robot.com it's a free community newsletter for people who want to boost productivity using AI thousands of people from Google meta Microsoft are members and there's a private Twitter for members only at you need a robot and you asked uh GPT right um and he she they said let's do it they they them said yeah let's do it I said great and then within one second I've been I like I was like oh my god do I have his number like one second 65 I send it over it's like probably 10 or 10 30 at night where I'm at and I lean over to my girlfriend and I was like oh I told her the story and I was like I bet he's not even gonna remember to post it um and I was just like it's all good I was like I know Jackson from back in the day I'm like it's all good if he doesn't post it I'm just like I'm happy like this is like my fun you know yeah there's like some some people you know this is I was having so much fun watching and following along long story short you post it it gets 2400 likes okay millions of views yeah and thousands of people join our Discord yeah oh and and overnight and best best 65 bucks you ever spoon it's probably the lowest cost for you know member or necklace yeah Acquisitions out of them all time and it was the most fun I I was like I couldn't fall asleep that night I would I imagine how I felt dude I mean honestly uh imagine I mean I would have I would have probably posted anyway I think I probably posted that link before you even hit the venmo but glad but I wasn't queer I was truly come to come to a mutual well yeah because I couldn't stop refreshing Twitter and I still can't I mean yeah I I hit 60 000 followers while I was on air on CNN like I crossed over that threshold while I was doing this interview which like I think that's kind of like symbolic and indicative of like this this crazy trajectory that like I'm really gonna try to like well this is what we talked about yesterday Greg it's like how do I kind of ride this wave and like you know keep it so let's talk about it growing for as much as possible yeah I think the plan right now is definitely to for the next 30 days at least do a thread a day with like actual progress like you know here's what the here's what the robot's done here's what's going on in the community here's like you know buy the numbers a little bit and kind of like get a get an update so definitely right so it's a problem at a day just to frame it for people Jackson so the problem you're trying to solve is once you find lightning in a bottle like what do you do with it on the internet right like what do you do with it because it's such a sacred uh uh sacred thing that you found and you don't want to squander it so no I didn't and I want to do it justice to it to it to a sense like all these people like I don't I wish there was a way that you could see how many people have notifications on for you because I think like a lot of people I mean I treat anything now and it's like 100 likes in a few seconds which I mean that's crazy so it means that people are actively paying attention they're invested they want to see what the outcome of this is they they I don't know care to an extent I think I'm I'm no um I I'm I try not to be too much of a realist but I I have my I understand that people don't really have attention spans and as soon as there's something new in a cool new news cycle that's going to be the new big thing so how can I earnestly and legitimately and uh sincerely continue to make content about things that I actually care about that also happens to be coinciding with things that people find compelling and engaging so that's going to be the kind of experiment over the next couple of weeks is like how can I continue to like clearly I've tapped into something that people are into and excited by um so how can I keep that going in a way that you know benefits the people who've decided to subscribe to my content because that's like a blessing and cool and like oh like you know it it feels good to be able to make someone smile or enjoy something or be like oh like go down a little rabbit hole learn something new change someone's mind um open someone to a certain possibility about something that's the cool thing about finding this lightning in a bottle like you said I think it's not about it's certainly not about getting a chat bot to make me a hundred thousand dollars that's it that's incredibly insignificant compared to the long-term effects of like you know how can we drive a conversation around maybe it's about people and the robots working together maybe it's just to change people's mind about you know maybe there is a future where AI doesn't take our jobs but supplements them in a way that makes us more empowered more creative have a a more clear voice that feel more confident maybe I don't know what I think that the future is just as possible as any doomsday scenario more so I think I really am an optimist on this I really think it's more so that yeah I think so you you called me a couple nights ago and you were like you're like I have a couple of minutes man that was last night sorry no that's true I mean it's it's been flying for me as well yeah it's crazy dude crazy so you call me last you called me last night and you only had a few minutes because you're a busy guy you know you're a viral sensation and you're you know and I'm like okay you know I'm chatting with Jackson today this is exciting so I end the call and you said Greg you've been here before you've hit Lighting in the mall before what would you do if you were me and then you started like rattling off a bunch of solutions you were kind of like I can create a Discord I can do this I can do this I can do this I can do this and I could tell and I've been in your shoes how overwhelmed you were and in terms of like you're like okay I need I need to make sure I'm making the right decision and what did I tell you what did I tell you to do and the reason I want to bring this up is because I think that this will be a helpful framework for other people to apply in their own worlds do you remember what I told you I like I said like you said I was I was overwhelmed I took a lot of notes on that but I can't reach my computer and pull it up I I think I things that I remember were to well it wasn't something as specific as come up with like prompt ideas and weekly challenges out of that that was trivial right I'll tell you what to me I said yeah I'll feed it to you I'll feed it to you yeah I said okay slow down Jackson like what do you want to get out of this what is your goal and then you're you kind of like stop and you're like hmm I don't really I haven't really thought about that and then I asked you okay okay like why do you think about that what is uniquely Jackson that is uniquely yeah I I think I can take it from here yeah go for it so I think what how do I want to say this maybe you could go back and kind of ask that question again like team me up a little what is unique what is uniquely Jackson well so I think my own history as like before I was a a branding designer before I was a in the design World um the reason that I even got into design in the first point or in the first place was because when I was 12 I loved new cool and exciting technology I looked up to people on Twitter not very much unlike yourself Greg and so when I was 12 years old I made a video podcast I interviewed my heroes I needed to learn how to design a website in order to you know host that it was kind of pre-youtube days in a way that snowballed into a love and a career that has been focused around design for the last 14 13 14 years of my life I've been on on Twitter over half of my life Greg um I I love design because I love Tech and I love new and exciting things so of course when AI starts to take this shrunt seat in everyone's narrative I want to be that guy at the intersection of and I hate the intersection of at the intersection of design and Ai and new just just using design as a baseline is a Common Thread to share my love for new and exciting things that's what I've always done that's what I've always felt like I am here to do in a lot of ways so you said to be that guy right that's exactly what I said and the reason I said that is because knowing you for as many years as I've known you for I know that you can be the best person on the planet in that space and thanks man I didn't think that it's not that I don't think you can be the biggest and baddest AI person on the planet but I actually think that you would have a lot more smiles and fun and and and Good Times at that intersection you you told me to Niche down that was the framework that you were saying was don't go broad a lot of people strike gold in something and they go super broad with it but I I loved that answer of like we'll look at it and be like do you really want to try to please everyone or connect with like the biggest audience or do you want to be I want to be well uh well what's the word I want to be present and understood and heard and well respected in a very specific Niche and I think that yeah it's like like you said I wouldn't yet um yeah here's the way I think about it I see I see it as like a Venn diagram so on the right Circle you have what your audience expects of you because now you have an audience and they expect something from you and in this case it's AI it's probably some challenges in some capacity um and then there's the left Circle which is uh Jackson's Niche and what is that Niche and I actually think there's probably an exercise that you can do that's even like more Niche than design quote unquote that you could probably like there's probably five elements of design that you really like like for example design tools or branding or XYZ yeah and the intersection of those is the product you build uh or is the product that you're going to build and that's how to think about it so from that then like how how could you possibly think about what product to build if you don't really really understand that that Venn diagram so that's why you start with the Venn diagram you get crystal clear and then you think about what are the the business goals that I need to have to support that and that's where it becomes I need to get people off Twitter onto my own audience as fast as possible because who knows change of algorithm totally it's you know that's number one it's in someone else's hand yeah someone else's hand and you know what happens firsthand when you when you put something else and you know when you put something in someone's hands like a robot you never know what's gonna happen it's true leave it up to leave it up to the powers that be and unfortunately those powers that be might not be human at all um I think I'm in the same place I or I'm in a similar place to where I was when we talked yesterday where I was like buzzing spinning like trying to do I literally was in an Uber to meet my mom for dinner last night to like get away for like a minute and I was in the Uber on my laptop and I felt like I was doing 20 things at once seriously it was it was that like because I'm not used to going from you know a relatively slow and reliable pace which I've been kind of cruising at for a couple years now to like Breakneck like go mode and that was I mean it was uh it was it was Whiplash for sure and so I think talking to you saying like you know slow down write this out figure out what that unique like the overlap in that Venn diagram is that resonated with me in a way that I felt like for the first time in 48 hours I could I could wrap my head around all of these factors that are playing it at once and I think I've already learned or I'm starting to learn a lot about you know working with other people and like you know how to effectively you know delegate certain responsibilities and like even if it is it's funny because it's taken an AI chat bot to kind of push me into a place where I what I feel like I need to do that but it's it's something that you know I think is a lifelong learning process and something this is certainly accelerated a lot of that kind of necessary growth and for that I'm I'm grateful and excited I I'm I'm eager to see where it goes and I I want to be as effective as possible at um kind of being a custodian not only to The Wills of this particular chat gbt but now to this large and growing audience that has kind of put trust in me to you know be that guy the other thing that we haven't mentioned is that you've been like prepping for this moment like your whole life in a lot of ways I mean we touched a little upon it but you are really special a really special individual so I Met You in 2014 I think 2014 yeah in San Francisco we were living in this house with a bunch of other like six to eight 18 year old Giga brains yeah yeah okay yeah and you were wearing like a full suit like you are now if you know you gotta watch by the way if you're listening this go on YouTube and like watch watch him because you know Jackson always dresses to the nine um and so you're wearing the suit and you you come over to my house I think the first time I met you you're like you wanted to hang out and I was like who is this like 18 year old or 17 year old or whatever smoking a cigarette where's shopping never see that never see I I saw like the way my house was structured is like my balcony is like over like I can see who's coming in front of me and I see this like 18 year old kid smoking a cigarette in a full suit I I hadn't seen a cigarette in years and I hadn't seen no a full suit in years yeah and I was like who is he the hell's going on yeah you come up and you just tell me about how you know you were you're a designer and some of your work that you've been doing from that you know you started a crypto company in 2015 I believe um so like way ahead of the curve you always had this eye for you know what's coming next I mean that I I wouldn't have started or I was a co-founder in that and I would not have been involved in that if it weren't for two of those five to six or seven eight guys however many people I was living with in San Francisco at the time uh two of them were starting this company and they asked me to be a third co-founder one of them was a former employee of yours um actually you know to to be completely honest with you actually the friend that was half formally Simon word free as well oh yeah everything all right um I the conversation I was having when I came up with the idea for the hustle GPT tweet was in one of my conversations with Stefan who's so good for my mind and so I could say you know maybe wouldn't be here if it weren't for well definitely wouldn't be here if it went for him in a lot of ways wouldn't have met you if it weren't for him wouldn't have about that guy anyway shout out Stefan what's up yeah amazing guy but I think like so actionable takeaway for people what do you think that is like what is it about your background and your story that pricked you for this moment look I'm I'm just gonna say it now because like I'm here like this is happening um you know I've always known that this is kind of my my I've always known that this is kind of my intended uh I don't want to say final form because that implies like you know some some some completion of something that's not at all what I mean to say when I had a conversation with my incredible friend Garrett Scott pipe dream Labs shout out we sat down for a cocktail in Oklahoma City about a year a year ago year and a half ago um and I asked him you know what is the one thing that you think that I'm failing to do that I could be doing better and because I trust him a lot as a person and he without missing a beat said making video content growing an audience online sharing your story with people you're meant to do this this is something that you haven't given a true shot at for whatever reason and you owe it to yourself and everyone else to do that and that really sat with me a lot and you know we can make excuses all day for why not to do something you know don't have enough time quality is not there not good enough embarrassed people are going to judge me people are gonna do I remember when I was 12 years old starting that first video podcast when I was you know talking to Gary vaynerchuk after he dropped his first ever book in 2009 I mean like way back when he was just a wine guy he was my hero and I sat down and I talked to him and that energy that I had the the conversation that we had the the that person that I was is a 12 year old kid as silly as it seems to say was something that I never forgot and that always stuck with me when I didn't make a career out of podcasting or vlogging or whatever it was back then and became you know full-time in design I said that's fine you know I can let it kind of Fall by the wayside but this always has been kind of eating at the back of my mind so this is uh as as big a push as I've ever had and it's it's a it's as good of a reason as any to go Full Tilt in that aspect of my personality that's always been you know very core to to who I am it's just it's just me here's uh here's my answer to that question Mario hit me so number one you always dress the part literally like you always dress the part you showed up I I only own like three outfits I'm just wearing the same things over and over again Greg you dress the part period so number one you dressed apart number two you played the part like you you started a video podcast when you were 12 years old and you interviewed Gary vaynerchuk like you you might not have done it well realistically um I mean maybe you did it well but you might have not done it well um and but you showed up and you played the part and then the last thing is you are the part you remained authentic throughout the entire Journey right and and that's sort of the the as I was saying about the Venn die the Venn diagram it's the left Circle yeah right it's a left Circle so um I want to end there because I I want to end there I think that's a good ending Place uh should be meant I I that that touches touches my heart I I appreciate you saying that because my pleasure well I I I you know respect you tremendously for for you know being a kind of a a role model in a lot of ways from from a distance and you know we've known each other for a really long time but I I appreciate you kind of being being here when I eat a little old guidance and asking the right questions and and help me out with that and saying that's really cool if you man I appreciate it my pleasure uh where where could people find you well where could people find you on the internet and then how could people get involved with this yeah whole craze well it's fortunately for them all in the same place on Twitter at jacksonfall uh j a c k s o n f a l l uh spelled pretty much like it sounds um I do do what do I want to say yeah on Twitter at jacksonfall uh people have uh co-opted and run with the hashtag hustle GPT you can see a lot of people live tweeting their progress there uh you can find my Discord for hustle GPT specifically on my Twitter account and uh you can subscribe to my sub stack where I'm hosting kind of regular updates about this and uh that's

The result?

“It's useful to think of all these different networks as being their own organisms.” - Emerson Spartz

This is why you should think of each social media platform differently.

Transcript Language: English
Greg: David Spinks, welcome to the show. Greg: For those of you who do not know David Spinks   he's the author of The Business of Belonging, which is my go-to community book and a must read. He was, you know, the founder of C M X, which is a community company, events, services business that got acquired by Bevy, and now he is from a sabbatical, which. , I want to start there. You took, you took some time off. What did you. David: Well, I learned that sabbaticals are dope. First of all, uh, highly recommend taking a sabbatical. I mean, I, I think like one thing you learn is that burnout is something that you aren't always totally aware of in the moment. Or you might know that you're tired or you're exhausted, um, but you don't really know the extent. It's the kind of thing that like, until you stop everything, like you put everything down and. Get back in touch with yourself in the present moment. Only then do you realize exactly how empty your tank is. And so like, I was like, yeah, you know, I was, I was still kind of hustling and getting stuff done and working hard and like, you know, I, I don't know that I would've told you that I was burned out before. I stepped down from C M X and from Bev and started my sabbatical and then, and then I did sabbatical and I turned off social media. I didn't use social media for months. I turned off email. I didn't have any meetings. I didn't do anything for work. I didn't write, I did nothing. and I started feeling better slowly. It ultimately took me, I think a whole year to get back to a hundred percent, but started feeling better. And you just start to realize like, Oh, shit. Th this was an option to feel this way. Like you didn't even know that you could feel better. Right. Because you all, all I've known for 15 years now of, of cranking on startups and business is like, I, I've only known that mode. And so it kind of just, I think the biggest thing I learned is that there are other states of living, and you probably don't recognize it if you've been doing the same thing for a long time. And a good way to, to find it is to drop everything. Greg: taking a year off is goals for a lot of people, but for people who don't have a year to take off, how do you take off some time, recognize that you're burnt out and then deal with it and Yeah. What, what, what advice do you have there? David: like from a financial perspective, I understand not everyone can take that time off. You know, my wife and I saved a lot of money, over our career and so, you know, we just are using our savings. My wife took the last year off as well, so we kind of did a sabbatical together, moved across the country, had another baby. So there's like a lot of other factors in there for us. Um, of course, like any, anything you can do to step back and create space is always gonna be good for you. And if you can't do a year, but you can only do a week, do a week, um, I would say that. For most people, you can take more time off than you probably think you can. I think a lot of people say like, I can't take even a day off. I can't take a week off. Like there's too much to do. You can , you can, you'll be fine. Um, especially if you're at a company that has vacation time. Like take it. If you have unlimited vacations, I'm great. Take unlimited vacation , you know, put it, put it to use and, things will not fall apart even though you think they will. Um, right. Like a big, a big thing that, you know, I I was struggling with was, this is my baby, it was my company, C M X and a team that I love to work with. And I was like, you know, what's gonna happen to the company after I leave? And you know, there, there's, there's like a lot of ego in that right to, to think that, um, it's all about me. but I've, I've just been so used to being the leader of the company for so long. It's, it's hard to imagine it without me. , but stepping back and, and this happened in small ways, when I would take time off, it created space for other people to step up. It created space for new leaders to form. It created space for other people to figure out what to do without me there, and a lot of really good things came out of it. So even leaving for a few weeks or a month and then coming back, you, you might find that you're coming back to a more sustainable situation because it'll be a, it'll be a lesson that it doesn't have to all fall on you. You don't have to do everything. You have really great people around you who can step up and help. Greg: What about leaving a community? you know, so there's a lot of people here who manage communities who are listening to this, who manage communities or even just manage audiences. what do you do when you're starting to feel a little burnt out and you need to take a step back? David: the challenge with the community is you feel like you don't wanna let the community down. Um, maybe you'll feel like the community will suffer if you're kind of the active leader of it and, and you're gonna step away. or, or you might feel like you're gonna lose trust. I think that's something that a, a lot of community people struggle with is like, I can't leave my community, my com What are, what will my community members think? Um, if I'm not even willing to show up, then how can I ask them to show up? Right. and those are all valid feelings and I've experienced them. It's, it's all the more reason to be building up a team around you in, in a more sustainable system. If your community revolves all around you, that's probably a red flag to begin with that. it's overly centered on, on one person and you're not creating more of a distributed sense of connection and responsibility and leadership. So I think you have an opportunity there to make your community something that can and should live on without you. two, I think like you're human and communities will always gravitate towards leaders who are human and honest and direct. And so if you tell your community that you've put your heart and soul and blood, sweat, and tears into this community and you're starting to feel burned out and that you're gonna need to take some time to yourself. Any community that wouldn't be supportive of that is probably not a community that I'd wanna be a part of, right? People who hear that experience will be able to relate to it, will be able to understand it, will be, will be grateful for everything that you've put into the community and will want you to take the time and refill because, you know, you, you have to bring the best version of yourself to your community if you wanna be a great leader. So taking a month off, taking time off, um, to be able to come back stronger is, is a good thing for the community. And if you really feel like it's time for you to move on, it's time to hand off the reigns to new leadership. It's time to transition. Um, then that's gonna be the best thing for the community as well, because you staying on as a leader, um, when you don't have the energy anymore, when you don't have the heart for it anymore, when you're not able to give it your all. Um, and you're, you're suffering your burning out. It, it's not gonna serve the community well. It's, it'll be much better to then hand off leadership to the people who, are gonna bring that energy and, and that ability to, to stay really focused to the community. Greg: So I came across this product today called Atris, A T R I S. Their tagline is an AI community manager. David: Mm-hmm. Greg: community manager. So I'm just on their, on their website. I'm gonna tell you a little bit about what it does, and I'm curious if you think, yeah, I'm curious if you think like it could help in moments of, you know, community manager needs to step out for a bit and, or just even if you have a community manager, enhance it. So here's what it says. It says the problem, so it works with Discord and Slack, and it says when a customer joins your Discord, but Discord is a noisy platform and it's hard to find good information quickly. A confused community member is much more likely to churn. Uh, in addition, it's hard to find links to documentation, tweets, blog. what they do, how it works, you add training data. So Atris scrapes data from Slack, discord notion. Basically places where you have data, they also monitor it. So if you like add new notion pages, it gets added. You connect a bot, so then you connect, like it's basically a discord, slack bot. Then your community members could ask it anything. So it's basically like, I don't know if you've seen, like Shopify has now an AI assistant in their shop app. Instacart has a, like an assistant. and then the use cases it says like developer communities, fan audiences, video game tournaments. Anyways, I'm curious what you think about using AI and something like this to help community managers run sustainable communities. David: Yeah, absolutely. I think it's. I was gonna pitch you on starting a community manager bot product, but I guess they already built it. So, uh, it's one of, you know, I've been keeping this long notes list of ideas of things I wanna build over sabbatical, and that's been one of them. I, I, it means it makes perfect sense look like there are things that humans are really bad at that we're not built for. and one of those things is being able to hold and process really large amounts of data, to be able to pull out the right data at the right time for the right information, for the right needs, rather. So for a community's a really good example and any community manager knows this experience where like, break this down into like jobs to be done or specific problems that that occur, one is somebody comes to a community and. Um, a few things might happen. One, they might be afraid to ask any questions cuz they're new to the community. They don't wanna ask the same question that's been asked before. They don't know the social norms, so, um, they wanna start learning, they wanna start engaging, but it's a big leap to post in a community, especially a large established community. and so, uh, they might not at all, right? A bot can help with that because it creates a very simple, easy way for them to ask a question and get an answer to that, to that question without having to interact with other people, which will help them become more familiar with the community, with the social norms of the community, with the basic questions that they might ask that will lead them to the point where they can be more comfortable asking a question the same way they might go read all of your help docs and search your website, and like they have to do all that work to get that information. A bot can make that easy. Right. Number two, they might go ahead and post a question, but yeah, it's the same question that's been asked a thousand times by every other person who, who joins a group, right? Like in C M X, the amount of times that someone's come in and just been like, Hey, how do you grow engagement in your community? It's like so broad that it's impossible to answer it. We've seen it a thousand times. Or like, Hey, what platform should I use for my community? It's like the same thing over and over and over again. And regular members will get pretty tired by that. Great. A bot can help eliminate that. Cuz if a bot can help answer, you know, the, the top. Hundred most commonly asked questions, then that will lead your members to ask more specific, more nuanced questions, go into more detail, and that will lead to better conversations as well. Um, and then on, not just on the content side, but on the, you know, think about it as like the c r M side. So every community, especially, you know, really large communities will have thousands and thousands and thousands of members, and every community manager knows this question, Hey, who, who should I talk to about, um, building engagement for, uh, direct to consumer products? Okay, well let me see, let me rack my brain for the 10,000 people in, in my Discord or Facebook group and think about like who's the exact right person who has experience with this, maybe who's like based in your region, who, um, you know, is at the right experience level, right? And like, I just have to pull this up from my head. And so what we end up doing as community managers is we create these shortcuts in our heads and we kind of have our go-to people. And so, um, you know, if someone asks me for a specific recommendation, I'll either have that go-to person and I keep sending everyone to that same person, which is one really overwhelming for that person. And two, doesn't give other people the opportunity to help. So it's not very inclusive in that way. Or I just won't have an answer. I'll be like, I, I don't know. Honestly, I can't think of a person off the top of my head to introduce you to, um, maybe you should just post in the community and ask, and maybe it finds the right person, right? But this is exactly what, uh, AI bot can help with because it can take literally the c r m of your community. It can organize and categorize. Everyone in the community, not just based on like tags and stuff like that, but it can look at all the content they post in the community and know, okay, this person's a good expert in this topic. This person's an expert in this topic. And so imagine if you could go to a bot and say like, Hey, I'm hoping to meet someone with, you know, that can help with A, B, and C. And the bot can say, great. Here's, you know, five people in the community that are active that have expressed interest in helping other members on these things. Uh, let me know if you want to connect with one of them. You say yes, and then the bot goes to that person and says like, Hey, this new member joined. They specifically asked about A, B, and C. Um, you're somebody who's has a lot of experience with this. Would you wanna connect with 'em? Yes. They say, yes, great bot connects them. Awesome. That's gonna do that a thousand times more efficiently than any human community manager. We'll ever be able to do. So that's just like two examples. And I think there's a lot more where actually bots are gonna be much better at large scale community management than humans are Greg: I mean, this is gonna be a, this is a tough conversation to have, but you know, I feel like if anyone, I can have it with you. You know, it's fast forward five years from now, do we even have large scale communities that aren't. Managed by these bots? Like is the, is the greatest community manager of a large community a bot? Or is it a human? David: Might be a bot. It might be a bot. So I, Greg: you know, I'll, I'll, I'll, be honest. David: yeah. Well, what do you think Greg: I mean, it's, it's, it's a bot. It's a bot in the sense, because, first of all, the bot is unbiased. Meaning David: Well, Greg: it's more unbiased than a human being. David: sure. It, it has collective bias from all the human beings. Greg: Yeah. it's okay. Human beings are extremely biased, even if it's subconscious based on where they grew up. , uh, what language they speak their experiences in life, You know, the, the biases in a bot would be if, you know, the human who is behind the bot essentially, codes it in a way that, inject some of those biases. But my thinking is if you compare a bot to a human being, I think a human being has way more biases than a bot. So that's one thing. David: True. Greg: Second thing is what you were describing around like essentially a community manager, like having this internal Rolodex that they're just sort of going through, like it worked for small groups of people, like how human beings were designed to like carry out community, like small pods of people essentially. Not these mega discord or slacks or whatever where you have tens, sometimes hundreds of thousands of people in there David: Yeah. No, it breaks. Greg: breaks. David: Okay, so there, there's also a difference between, you know, if we could suss out the, the question into, into more specifics, like, who's gonna be running the community? Bots are humans. Well, um, there are aspects, there are large aspects of the communities that I think are gonna be run by bots. And we described a couple examples there. There are things that bots can't do, um, or won't be as good at. Like, I don't know that a bot is going to build the community from the ground up. It's like recruiting people, um, will be hard because that's, sure. It could optimize email outreach, which is weird. Imagine just like a bot going out there and just emailing lots of people. Like it'll probably happen. Um, but it's not gonna build relationships in the same way. definitely not if it's being transparent and it's saying it's a bot. If you don't know it's a bot, then maybe it can still build relationships to some stand to some extent. But I think growing the community will be hard. I think, creative collaboration will be hard. Like a bot is good at summarizing, and it c it can even be creative to some degree of, but it, it's limited by what's existed before if you wanna get people together to be ideating on something new, right? Like if, if we ask Chad g p t right now, how do you measure a community? Its answer is gonna be based on the best answers to this point on how to measure community. it's not going to come up with a new way that we haven't really thought about yet, I Greg: Yeah, no, not yet. David: right. Not yet. Yeah. There, there are layers that we might get to. Um, but so like there are things that humans. Will always come together for, and, and the actual conversation is gonna be humans. So one, one thing that's fun to think about, is, we talk a lot about like leaderless communities. How like, oh, it's, it's kind of like a kind of one of those bullshit utopian community things that people say like a perfect community has no leaders. Um, which like, I don't know, I don't think that's true, but Ima like a, a bot might actually be the most efficient way to get to that point where Yeah, a community is literally all about the members cuz the leadership, the facilitation, the introductions, the sourcing, the right content, the moderation, all that can be done by a bot. It's the actual conversation and interaction and relationship building that the bot's not gonna do. And all the members can do that. Like if you go to any community that's like, sure, the leader could be facilitating conversations, but once a community's organically growing and running, it's the members having those conversations, building those relationships. So maybe the best way to get to a true leaderless community is to make the bot the leader. Greg: maybe, maybe here's where I think humans still have the edge on, on bots, so you know, being in a slack, being in a discord, something like that. Text-based communication, that's like a low, low resolution conversation versus let's say, sharing images or sharing vi video or, uh, having live video or being in person, uh, with a lot of people, you know. So I think think of it as a spectrum, like the lowest level is just like, essentially messaging back and forth. And a human being is, is incredible at being in person and drawing upon personal experiences to create that connection that, really helps with community. So, good news, community managers, you're gonna outperform 10 on 10 on that because you'll be able to, let's say you're, you know, you're, you're hosting a. You know, a yoga community, um, and you're doing like, hot yoga with 10 other people. You can be like, hot yoga, save my life. I used to be a meth addict and now I'm doing hot yoga and it changed my life. And a bot can't say that. David: No bot that I know. Greg: My bot not yet, David: Not yet until bot, until bots start doing meth and falling in love with high yoga, uh, . I love, love the example. You're right, right? Like, you know, bots don't have trauma and humans connect around trauma. They connect around those shared experiences and Yeah, like in person, bot can't do in person, right? Not yet. Um, the more, the more human traits come into play, the less the bot will be able to provide that. Even like, I mean, we already know, like Zoom feels less human than talking in person because there's all. Little subtle things about how we interact. Like right now, I can't look you in the eye. I can look at the camera, I can kind of look you in the eye, right? But like, I can't look you in the eye. So we're actually on a chemical level, not able to connect on the same way that we're able to in person. And there there's a chemical reaction that humans have. Uh, when we are together in person, when we can touch, when we can smell, when we can see each other, when we can look each other in the eye, when we can hug. Like these are things that bots are not gonna be able to do. I mean really like at the end of the day, we're in communities to connect with each other, to feel heard, to feel cared for, to uh, feel like we're not alone. And I don't care how good a bot this is. Why before I was like, well, it depends if the bot tells you it's a bot or not. Cuz it can use all the exact words that a human does. But the very knowledge that it's a bot will undermine any sort of relationship that you can build with it. Greg: It's gonna, it's gonna tell you it's a bot. yeah. I hope, um, you ever see the, you ever see the Jetsons Two interesting things about the Jetsons, um, regarding bots. So, Rosie from the Jetson, she was like the mechanical maid. First is She never called George and Jane by their first name. , she always called them Mr. And Mrs. Jetson or Mr. And Mrs. J, which lesson there is like your bot. Of course you're like, it was programmed to do one of those two things, either calling it Mr. J, Mr or Mrs. J or Mr. Or Mr. Mr. And Mrs. Jetson. So human beings are just like better at knowing like the context. and especially with like human, you know, looking at someone's crying, looking if someone's laughing and based on that reacting in an interesting way. So that's one thing, uh, which is interesting. The second is her antenna always flashes and beeps at the start, at uh, and the end of her sentences. So every time she would say something like Clock. the antennas would go. And it's another example of how mechanical they make Rosie out to be. How she's like, basically just coded. and I think that's another issue with, with bots in general, like that's the, that's the con of bots is that, it's very difficult to get them in an I R L setting to act a bit differently. Also, I just wanted to bring up the Jetsons. David: Take every opportunity I can to bring up Elroy. Um, yeah. So, but like, these are thi these are choices that people made, right? To build rosy that way. And so you would hope that people who build bots will build bots that always make it clear that they're a bot. But, you know, if someone chooses to build a bot and, and not have it tell people that they're a bot and it just says, you know, send out, I, I, I went through on my newsletter like an example of can a bot build a community? Like what would it look like for a bot? And I had it do all these tasks that I would do if I was launching a community. So I had to identify potential members, I had to identify potential leaders to bring in, to do q and as I had it, write the email to invite. To like recruit people to join the community and try to make that as compelling as possible. And it did a pretty damn good job of writing an email that sounds compelling, that like, it made it sound like a, i i I use a tree community. Um, and, and where everyone pretends to be a different kind of tree. And it came up with all these great tree puns and it like talked about the mission and the values of the tree community and how we all speak a tree langu. Like it came up with some stuff that I'm like, this actually sounds like a I don't know if everyone would be interested in it, but it sounds unique. Like people who are into it would be really into it. And so like a bot can send out a really compelling recruiting email. A bot can send out a really compelling onboarding message. A bot can start really interesting conversations. It can do pretty much all the things that a human would do when launching and managing an online community and. Would you know that it was a bot? May, like, sometimes you can tell, sometimes you can't. so if someone chose to build a community and have the bot not tell people that it's a bot, I, I think that a community would still form and we would never know. Greg: Yeah, I think the ethics behind, is this a bot or not? I think if the bot makes the de the decision to like send the email, then to me the ethical thing to do is to be like, this was sent by a bot, but if David Spinks is behind, you know, chat g p t in the sense that he put it, you put, you prompted it, you looked at it, then you might've changed a few words, you edited a few things. And even if you didn't edit, you just like copied and paste, but you're like, I proofread this. Then I think ethically it's okay, uh, to be like, it's me, it's David Spins. Um, just like it's okay to like, if you're going from point A to point B on a car, um, like that's kind of like a mechanical thing, helping you get somewhere quicker. David: Different Greg: How's it different? David: Well, my GPS isn't like how I'm crafting my identity. , you know, your words are who you are. It's how you're presenting yourself to other people. It's how you're building relationships. So, you know, Greg: let's say you publishing on spell check and you have spell check. Isn't it a similar thing? Like what's the difference between David: similar, like it's a spectrum on a, on a, you know, if you look at it as, as a, as a kind of grid, you know, on, on one side of the X axis you have. Google Maps and on the other end you have a full on, you know, her style robot. There's a spectrum there. And, and using Jet Chat g p t to write an email on your behalf, and not saying it is probably closer to the, her end of the spectrum than the Google Maps end of the spectrum. Greg: you were running Apple, let's say, you know, would you make it so that if you know every email you sent, if it was edited with chat G B T, it would have some sort of disclosure, David: So like, I'm not, I'm actually not sa I'm not saying that it's wrong for, you know, Greg to useche G P T to get a client to pay their bill. You know, it's, uh, it's okay to do that because I think that you're still reviewing that and you're making the choices say like, these are the words I choose to send. You're making that choice. I don't think that's unethical for you to use chat G B T to give you the words Greg: for the record there, you know, you're referring to how I recovered $109,500 from a client who wasn't responding to our emails, and I used chat g p t to do it. what I didn't post in that thread is that I drafted the, the email I, well, I prompted. I got that, uh, I edited a couple things. I actually sent it quickly to my lawyer. I was like, is this like a good collection? And she was like, it's perfect. She, she didn't, she had no David: Review. Greg: yeah, no comment. Sent it. David: Yeah. So, so, yeah. You know, even if you didn't do that, you, you were still the human reviewing it and it's, you, you're sending it under your name and you chose to go ahead with those words. So, you know, I don't think it's unethical anymore than, I don't know, is using a ghost writer unethical, um, may, maybe that's even more unethical cuz you're like kind of using someone else's creativity to write on your behalf. Um, but like a bot just giving you the words to use It's great. And, and going back to the community example is, is actually I think really good for us as community builders cuz the amount of emotional labor that we have to take on to manage communities. Like when I have a situation in community where I have a member who is, I have members who are fighting each other, or I have a member who's really angry at me or at our business and I have to, uh, deescalate conflict or I, I have to, Respond to someone who's really upset with me. That takes so much emer emotional energy to come up with the right words, to thoughtfully engage with people and community professionals, community builders, we have to do this day in and day out. And that, that, those are the most extreme ones, but even small ones, you know, someone who's having a hard day and we want to give 'em the right words. Um, someone who's having a challenge at work and you wanna give them something very practical. It's just a lot of energy that's constantly going into helping community members. And that's another thing I did in the newsletter example. I had chat, G P T. Respond to, um, someone who made like a vulgar comment in the community, and it was really good. Like it was maybe better than what I would've written to moderate a community. When a, when a member violates the rules and says something offensive and great, now I can take that, edit it a little bit, and I didn't have to spend half an hour perfectly wording this highly emotional piece of text. Now, now I can, as a community builder do this much more sustainably. Greg: also, like you're the goat of community. So the fact that you, who has so much experience, you know, being a part of hundreds if not thousands of communities and seeing it firsthand, get something back from a robot that's like really good, if not maybe even better, that we can come up with quickly. I think quickly is, is, is is the important piece cuz like, yeah, maybe if you spend 30 minutes like drafting it, it would be great, but you're, you know, you're busy, you've got a hundred things you're doing, you know, your baby's crying, you know your employees, this, you know, there's a lot going on. So I think, the cool thing just about AI in general is it allows you to be multiple places at the same. David: It certainly makes you more efficient and we talk about it from a time perspective, but I think the emotional perspective is also really important. Greg: Yeah. So, shifting gears a little bit, or maybe not shifting gears that much. you have all this knowledge in community. you're a free agent. Uh, there's this ai boom happening. There's a community based businesses boom happening. David: I feel like I've written three newsletter articles about like what I'm gonna do next and all of them kind of start with like, I have no idea. Um, uh, what I'm doing right now is, is a few things. Um, I'm writing cuz I like writing. Um, I mean, I hate writing, but I like the outcomes of writing and I like the end products of writing. Um, I like the torture of writing and so I'm doing the newsletter. I really enjoy that. Um, writing is how I'm going to get motion to. Put myself in the position to find things that excite me. I think it's really hard. People who just kind of sit around and wait for a lightning to strike and to get inspiration on something they wanna work on, but they don't move their feet, they don't get any motion. It, it's, you're just hoping that it finds you by, I think by writing, by putting stuff out there, by putting content out there, you, you're essentially putting out these signals, you're connecting with people, you're thinking you're pro processing. And so that's what I'm doing. I'm just thinking, processing, sharing, writing. Um, so I'm putting a lot of my effort into the newsletter right now. That might become my full-time thing on its own. If I can really generate enough income from that. Um, or I might lead me to whatever comes next. Beyond that, I'm consulting. Um, so I have, uh, three clients right now. I have two more I might sign and then I'm probably pretty booked up. Um, And I've just, you know, I, I enjoy that cuz it, it gives me lots of ideas to write about. For one, I get to work with a lot of different kinds of companies. I'm working with a company that's doing micro schools, so it's a very unique community problem. I'm working with a, a physical gym and, and personal training company. and so, I enjoy doing that. It gives me a variety of different kinds of community problems to solve. Um, I'm doing this talent collective thing as well, so I'm helping companies hire for community. I have over 160 really incredible candidates that I curate in, in the collective. And I help companies who are hiring connect with them. They're all people who are open to new. Job opportunities. and that's mo mostly been a way to just help people through kind of the layoff, uh, crisis that's happening. and for me it's, it's, it's another kind of, I'm, I'm sort of testing different products that can be passive income as well. Um, I'm, I'm sort of designing more of a independent, creator lifestyle business to see if I can do that. You know, I have two kids now. I'm not feeling so motivated by like trying to do some big VC back thing. I'm feeling more motivated by having autonomy of time and lifestyle and being able to pick up and drop off my kids and, spend my time doing the work that I want to do. So, lightning might strike. I, I, I remember how I felt when, when we started C M X and the energy I felt around that. it was like I couldn't stop myself. I, I wanted to throw everything I had into that. I don't think I've found that thing yet. Um, when I find it, I'll know it. Until then, I'm just gonna keep writing. Greg: Okay, I got a, I got a fun set of questions to answer, which, uh, you're gonna have to answer it. So, cuz you're here. You're here, you're here. So you've interviewed some incredible people at C M X. I'm gonna go through a f a list of those people, a short list of them, and I'm gonna ask you if that person was giving you advice on what to do, what do you think they would say? Okay. So to start, one of my favorites, and I know one of your favorites, Seth Godden. If Seth Godden was sitting here and he was giving you advice on what you should do, what is the one thing you should. What do you think he would say? David: It would be very short and poetic, um, something along the lines of, Do the thing that you can do in a way that no one else can do it. I think he's always been very much about, finding the uniqueness in yourself and that one thing or voice or message that you can bring to your work, to the world, to marketing copy to anything, that, It comes from your unique story and your experience and no one else can do. And like you can only find that by going inward. You can't find that by like looking for the best market opportunity. You're trying to make money. You can only do that by kinda looking within yourself. That's what I think Seth would tell me. Greg: I love that. Go, go inward and, and, you know, keep going. Uh, number two, our, uh, our friend Ryan Hoover. What would Ryan say? David: Um, I think Ryan would be a little bit of the opposite of Seth. I think Ryan's a very pragmatic business mind, uh, who would kind of see the opportunities in kind of like business, uh, community-based businesses that's growing. Um, you know, he and I have talked in the past about doing like a course together or. I've talked to him recently about, um, one thing I've thought about is doing a sort of fund for community. So being able to invest in, uh, community-based companies and community-based software. and he obviously knows a thing or two about that. so I think he, he's someone who just like sees he's such a good finger on the pulse of tech and products and kind of the zeitgeist of, of business and I think he would, he would spend a lot of time helping find like where things are going and what I can build to, to put myself in the right position to catch that momentum. Greg: I agree. I think he would want, you to, you know, you've got so much built, built up knowledge and you're in the right place at the right time, and I think he'd want you to build the right product for that. so I think that's, that's true. A few more. Scott Heiferman, uh, who founded meetup.com. David: Hmm. he probably told me to start a nonprofit. I feel like Scott's like one of the most authentic community founders in the game. And, um, I haven't talked to him about this. I'm curious what he would say, but I get the vibe that he's like, if he could do Meetup again, it would be more of like a Craigslist, Wikipedia style. Just like open belongs to society kind of platform. and I think like he's just a visionary with, with those kinds of community. Platforms and, and building tools for community in, in, in that mindset. And so, I think he would probably tell me to look at like, what society needs the most right now. And forget about market, forget about business, forget about the capitalist aspect of things. Just what's the most human impact I can have, uh, by building community, uh, tools or software or, or programs. Greg: Okay, we're gonna do three more. Joe Navarro, who's fam famous for the power of non-verbal communications. David: that's a tough one. That f. First of all, my, my interviews and work with him was a long time ago, and he, yeah, so he is an FBI agent who, um, watches shit. It's amazing, like the stuff he shares about like how you can read people based on their body language and their emotion. He probably would have watched this interview and noticed how my face was twitching at certain points and where my hands were. And he'll say like, Hey, when you said these three things, you seemed really confident, but when you said these three things, you lost confidence and you felt very uncertain about yourself. So you should probably focus on those three things that that made you act confident. And I have no idea what those are. So if Joe watches this, let me know. Greg: David Marquette, former nuclear submarine, captain and author of Turn the Ship Around. What would he say? David: Ah, David's awesome. That's such a good book. Have you ever read that book? Greg: No, but uh, it's like one of those must reads, right? David: You should read it. Yeah, it's, it's incredible. Um, Shane, Shane Mack was, who introduced me to Lieutenant David Marque originally. And he's amazing. He's just like the kindest person. I got to go down actually for three or four days and spend time with him in his house, um, down in Florida. He like lived right on the ocean and we just like rift on business and community and leadership, um, and just like hung out. It was, it was really, it was special. And that was like, we barely knew each other and he just like invited me down to do that. He's like that kind of person. Um, what would he tell me? Um, I think David just like, uh, I think what he knows best is he's, he is, uh, you know, become this great author and speaker and, and that's what he does for a living now since he was, you know, retired from being a nuclear submarine captain. So, a little different. So he'd probably tell me, he'd probably advise me on that path, um, to continue to grow as a leader, um, for community builders to speak, maybe write another book, um, and understand, you know, he's, he's done the whole independent entrepreneur path, so maybe he could teach me how to do that Greg: Alexis Ohanian, uh, co-founder of, uh, Reddit 7 76 Venture Fund. What would, uh, Alexis say as an OG community product guy? David: Hmm, that's a good question. What would Alexis say? I think like Alexis gives me some similar vibes to Ryan in some ways. Like someone who just is so plugged into the zeitgeist and sees the big opportunities way, way ahead of a lot of other people. Um, and he just kind of brings a community mindset to every product, every company he works with. It's like there's always like a community undertone to it. Um, what would he tell me to do? think something that, Does is, um, and I, what seems to be a priority for him in the last several years as he's kind of evolved is like really rising up a lot of other leaders and, um, whether those are like partners in his firm or other entrepreneurs, or his, like, passion for, you know, women's soccer leagues and things like that. So I think he just like wants to rise others up and, and give, I think he has a big voice, uh, um, a big focus on giving a voice to people from underrepresented groups. And so I think he would guide me in that direction of like how to have an impact on giving the next generation of community builders and maybe great community builders who aren't getting their voices heard. how can I help rise up their voices? Greg: Okay. I got a bonus one. David: Man, these are hard. You didn't prep Greg: listen when I invited you on. I didn't, I didn't say it was gonna be, uh, super easy, but I think when, when I invited you on, I was like, Hey, let's just have an, you know, a conversation and we're having a conversation David: This is true. This, that's a broad promise. A conver . This is indeed a conversation. Greg: So the bonus one, and perhaps my favorite one is, what would 2014 David Spinx say to 2023 David Spinx 2014? because I think that's when I met you. Basically, we were both living in San Francisco, um, and you, you know, it was early days of cmx, uh, from what I remember, you were just getting it started, um, starting to see some traction. Um, and you were doing it at a time where a lot of your peers and friends were doing like these big venture back things, and you were doing like more of a bootstrap thing in community, which was like not very, you know, attractive at the time. yeah. What would he say to, to you? David: he would say to look for opportunities. in places that you love, that you have a passion for, but you, you feel like it's too small or there isn't a big enough business opportunity. So I, the re where I'm going with this is like, when I started C M X, I did not intend for it to be my full-time thing. uh, it was my buddy Max Chu. and I started together. I had told him about the idea for the conference, um, over the years before that we got to know each other. And he was like, in, in 2014, that's when he was like, Hey, do you want to do this? I know how to run a conference. I'll handle logistics, and you lead speakers and kind of the brand and everything and. We did it, I was still running. Um, I was, I co-founded a company called Feast with my good friend Nadia, um, who I think you know as well. Um, and we were still doing that at the time, and cm, it frankly wasn't going that well. And, um, money was getting tighter and tighter. And so CMX was in part a way to like bring in some extra income. It was an idea that I've had that I was talking about for a long time, but never pulled a trigger on. and part of the reason was I never saw community as this is the thing that's gonna be my big. Break as an entrepreneur. Um, and at that time I was definitely more focused than I am today at like, I was looking for. Like, you know, what's the big thing? What's, what's the thing that I can really blow up that's gonna, um, hopefully generate wealth to have a lot of impact to like be the big business that I want to build, right? I wanted to have that kind of success under my belt. And I stu you know, feast was like an online cooking school. It was like completely different. Um, before that I worked with, uh, SeatGeek and I did a and like an online blogging platform and community was always a thread through everything I did, but it was never like the thing, and people always called me the community guy back then. Like even when I was first, early in the career, they'd be like, oh, Davis Swings is a community. And I'm like, no, no, no, I'm not the community guy. I'm an entrepreneur, I'm a founder. I like build businesses. I'm not the community guy. And they're like, yeah, okay, but like, talk to us about community. And then I talked to him about community for hours cuz it's what I loved and it was my passion. Um, and then it was only after that first C M X. Just being in that room with all those people and feeling it and, and seeing the reaction from people who like, got a lot of value from that event and felt like they weren't alone for the first time in their career. And having those conversations that I was like, oh, this, this, this is what I've been meant to do. Like actually the way for me to build something great as an entre entrepreneur isn't to go around community. It's through community. And so I think 2014 Spinx would say, keep an eye up for those kinds of things. Now what are the things that feel peripheral that you love and you just, for whatever reason, have an assumption that it's not the thing? Maybe inspect that and you might find some. Greg: related to that, someone, uh, dmd me, something I said on the My first Million podcast, which I have no recollection of saying, is like, it changed my life. But what I said was, and I wrote it down, When you think about what you wanna spend your time doing, think about what you've spent your time doing. Meaning like if you are, like spending hours talking about community. Like there must be a reason why you're talking about it. Like, you know, you're, you're, you're curious in some capacity or you have this innate understanding of it. So I think that's a really, it's an insight. I don't even know if I said it, but apparently I said it, um, that, you know, David: it was either you or Aristotle. I, you know, I always get you too Greg: Yeah, it was me, Sam Par or Sean for he said it. but yeah, I David: They get enough credit for, for these, these one-liners. We should give you this one. Greg: yeah, so yeah, I think, uh, 2014 spins probably had that in mind when, when he was giving you this present day advice. Um, I like doing this exercise because it's like the personal board of advisors, uh, framework, which is. Like in your head, who would be like your personal board of advisors living dead? Uh, people, you know, people you don't know. You can even, you know, add people that you don't know onto that list and, and say like, you know, I don't know Gary Vayner truck, let's say, but what would Gary Vayner truck say about this? Um, what would my grandfather say? What would my, you know, and then you can play it out. And it, and the reason why it's helpful during crossroads, like this is, and, and this actually goes back to biases too, is everyone is gonna give you advice and everyone has some bias advice, and sometimes it's good just to like, get as much advice as possible. And then from that, see what really sticks with you, what feels good. so I leave you with, that David Spinx. I'm happy, uh, you got to join us for, for an episode. David: I'm absolutely honored to be here. Always, always fun to jam. I feel like we could do an entire podcast, like show, like launch a new podcast and just do this every week and talk about community. So maybe that's what, is that the advice that Greg Eisenberg would give me? Greg: what do you think 2014, Greg Eisenberg would, you know, advice what? What would he say and what would 2023 Greg Eisenberg give you advice? What would that be? David: Um, I don't think, I don't know that 2014 Greg Eisenberg feels that different than 2023. Greg Eisenberg, I feel like you've been pretty steady. I don't know. Greg: So, yeah, what would that advice be? David: if only I could ask you I'll just share the advice you've given me, which is, you know, find the fun, Greg: Yeah. David: you know, find the thing that brings you joy. and I, I think I actually, I think about that all the time. I think it's, it's hard advice when I, the way I used to apply it is like, I'm like, oh shit. Like, what brings me joy? And then I start thinking about it and it's, you start trying to like, find the things that bring you joy. It's like, well, I like playing basketball, but like, like, is that like, I don't, I don't see a thing that I'm gonna do there that's like my business or my, my career. And I don't know that I want that to be my career. It's kind of like my fun thing, and I always kind of go in that loop. But the way I've been using your advice, just so you know, Is like as a filter whenever I come up with ideas. So I have this long list of ideas of articles I wanna write and projects I wanna launch and people I wanna collaborate with. And it's easy to start feeling overwhelmed cuz like, all right, well there's all these things. Which one should I do? And, and you start to think about the criteria for, you know, what, what you should focus on. And I've just found that that advice is really helpful in those moments to go through it and just feel like, literally pay attention to your heart and what, what's, what's getting you going when you look through it? What's something that feels like it will bring you joy if you do it? And that, that's been a really helpful gauge to eliminate some things that like, seem like good ideas, but I'm like, I don't wanna do that every day. Um, and find things that like actually that there's some things that seem like they might be really fun to do there and I should explore that more. Greg: Someone once asked me, what is the purpose of life? And I remember being like, first of all, I'm not Gandhi or, uh, Mother Teresa, but I'll take a stab at answering it, which is have the greatest amount of moments like the greatest ratio of pinch me moments that you can possibly have in your. So for example, like if you're going through life and you're not like pinching yourself, being like, wow, this is so like, incredible, amazing, whatever. Then do things that try to get you, you know, pinch me moments. And this can be in business, meaning like doing things that get you really excited, having great meetings, closing business, creating products that do really well. But it can also be in like life, right? Like having a child, you know, you've had, you know, two children now and that's many pinch me moments. Could be a lot of different personal milestones and it's really about architecting your life around these pinch me moments. So, thank you David Spinks, people could follow you at David Spinx, S P I N K S. On Twitter and there, there's his, his newsletter, which is a must subscribe, his book, which is a must buy, and that job board he was talking about, which you can go check out Hopefully no AI generated copy.

Greg: So I knew I recognized you from the hallways of McGill University Trung: Well, I guarantee that, that there was no photo put up. I was not a good student. I dropped out of pre-med because the classes start at 8:00 AM I'm like, I need to do something that starts from noon. And it was like, history and sociology. So that's how I ended up not graduating as a doctor Greg: So you're from BC and you went to school at McGill. Trung: Yeah, my, I grew up in Calgary and my family, went to Vancouver when I was like nine years old. It's a funny story. Both my parents are Vietnamese refugees, actually As you said, you're from Montreal. It's quite a bit a pretty big Vietnamese community in Montreal because of the French. and my dad just kept on going west, so I was born in Calgary and he's like, I need to go one more. City West is like Vancouver, like, let me get back as close as possible to Asia. But like, obviously the Pacific Ocean is massive, so , I dunno what he trying to accomplish, but he got there. But yeah, so ended up going to McGill, but, uh, man, dude, we could spend the whole hour talking about McGill. I can't believe you dropped out. I mean, maybe it was the right move, but I had a freaking blast there. Greg: what was like the highlight from your McGill experience? Trung: So did you live in a residence or were you kind of off the island? Greg: No, no, no. Do I look like an off island person to you? that joke is so niche, like no one is gonna get that. No. Trung: Yeah, exactly right. You're three listeners from Montreal. I mean, you guys are a pretty big audience. You might have more than you expect. Um, honestly, man, it was, uh, I mean, it's gonna sound lame. It was the partying, it was insane. It, the reason I went was because I heard how insane McGill was, and it just delivered on every front. Right. And I've only been back twice since I graduated, so it was like twice in 10 plus years. And now looking back, I think I, I recognize how insane it is that McGill's campus was literally in downtown Montreal. And like within two blocks in any direction was the craziest party street you could have. And yeah, I mean, I did nothing of academic value or like professional value while I was there. So like that, yeah, that's it. To answer your question, it was literally partying. Greg: Yeah, I feel like, you know, being social parting, whatever you want to call it, like that just sets you up. . I hope we don't have too many young listeners, but that just sets you up for like, in a lot of ways success. Like if you're able to like, go into a party, meet people, connect with people, whatever, like it's, it's really underrated in terms of like setting you up for success, doing what we do, writing on the Trung: no, 100%. Totally agreed. What I would say is this is if, unless you're a very clear track, I mean, everybody knows this, it's cliche at this moment, but the purpose of university, it's not the education, right? Like you can get a better education, not within the Greg: is that? That is Trung: It's very cliche, right, Greg: I thought you were gonna go into Twitter is a free university for, you know, for 99.9% of people. Trung: I mean that is, that is the true, well, well, let's bring in Twitter. Actually, the best part of Twitter is in the university part. It's the socializing part. I mean, how many people I know for a fact that. You and a number of other, you know, quote unquote creators or people that built pretty large audiences, you are all in one group chat together. Right. It's like, it's a social thing. It's like, uh, it's a very social element. So even though we call Twitter free university, the best part of Twitter is still the social part. Greg: Yeah. So that group chat is me, Sahil Bloom, Shaan Puri, Sam Parr, Nick Huber. Trung: Yeah, That's Greg: Austin Reif. Julian Shapiro was also in it at one point, and he left. but Trung: Wait, he left the group chat. Greg: that's another story. Trung: it just, one day you wake up and you know what? The group chat, I don't leave group chats cuz how awkward it is to see that person leaving the group chat. I just have to mute it. But when you mute the group, yeah. Greg: Also, side note, Courtland Allen was also in the group chat, also left the group chat. Yeah. So it's on for everyone. Um, but yeah we created this group chat. We called it initially the a 100K Club. It was like peak, covid summer, I think 2020. Spring and summer 2020. And the idea was How do we build big audiences? We all had 10 to 15,000 Twitter followers at the time, and we're like, how do we get to a hundred thousand? Now fast forward today, like Sahi has almost a million. Everyone in the group chat has like 300,000 and or around, you know, that number. And it's definitely changed our lives. Trung: Do you think that could still happen today or do you think it was a very covid specific thing? Greg: I mean, it's happening today, you know, I feel like we're actually witnessing it in like the AI world. Like there's a bunch of AI creators that I know are, that are kind of like banding together and like, like I see them like pumping up their stuff on Twitter. so yeah, it's happening. Trung: the thing that I always tell people about Twitter, is just the idea. Like, you'll get the top 1% of any field, right? Like they'll just be there exchanging ideas and you know, as soon as you have a couple people in that field that are quote unquote the top of their field exchanging ideas, no one else in that field that's wants to compete, concede that ground, right? They're like, oh fuck, this person's like, he's got the mind share. So now I gotta jump in here. So can't take it. But what essentially happens is that when you look at Twitter, it's not about, Hey, what is your vertical industry? It's like, can you get yourself into that 1% where everybody's hanging around in a giant group chat, right? And like, if you can just, whatever you're like, I always use a car dealership guy as a great example. you know, his niche is very niche. It's car dealerships, but the information is so good and it's just so, uh, engaging that he's elevated now where he has celebrities and athletes and founders and CEOs following him, right? So just gotta get in that, gotta get in that, that, that, the layer on top. That's all I gotta say. That's like my advice. Greg: Yeah, I think the, you know, the, just to comment on that, like the cool part about Twitter is like you could get into that room and that's actually like why I initially, me and Sahel Trung: Oh yeah, the name of the podcast room where it happens. Greg: Literally like that was the idea is like bring people, uh, the top 1% have conversations and I think it always reminds me of South by Southwest. I think Gary Vaynerchuk used to have like after parties in his like, hotel room, which sounds weird, but I, I swear I I don't think it was Trung: No. So sounds totally normal. We listen, we started off with McGill party dude, after parties in hotel room. Totally got it. Greg: Yeah. People are gonna hate this episode or love it, one or the other. So I think he would just like, you know, Tim Ferris would be there and, know, Garrett Camp and Travis from Uber would be there and they'd have these like jam sessions, I think they were called. and probably, I mean, I was never invited, so by the way, like, you know, I was never in that invited, but I always wanted to go. Cause I was always like, imagine being a fly in that, you know, on the wall and hearing these conversations that these people are having, like, amazing. Trung: Yeah. Greg: Twitter allows you to make that happen. Trung: just just wanna be clear, I think we're on the same page right here. One top 1% doesn't mean, like financially, we're not saying, oh, you know, you have to be finan. We're saying like, whatever your field is or whatever criteria you choose to judge your field, like that 1%, like let's say you're your medical researcher, you're really good at publishing or whatever, right? And you're, you're just passing, that's, that's what we mean here Greg: Yeah, exactly. And I just wanna be clear that whatever happened in Gary's room was probably, kosher, Trung: Yeah. Yeah, exactly, exactly. Greg: Um, okay. So Chung fan, internet legend. Trung: Uh, I'll take that. I'm Greg: I mean, you are, I mean, when, when Trung: too many compliments. Greg: when Elon Musk replies to your Twitter, I consider you notable Trung: Okay. Okay. Greg: who, who are you and what are you doing? Trung: so as mentioned, obviously partied, a lot of Miguel and, uh, had no real plans for my professional life, although you said you, you told me on the pre-chat you dropped outta McGill, so you, you totally get the idea of like not really knowing what you're doing in university, Greg: right. And like I dropped out, like, you know, we went to school around the same time. Like it was like If you dropped out back then, like Trung: Yeah, in the, in the, like the late aughts in like the oh five to oh 10, the tenor. Yeah. Insane right in it was. Now obviously it's way more normalized, but, uh, yeah, I didn't really have, I might as well have dropped out. didn't make a difference, right? I could have gone started earlier, so, uh, in whatever my career ended up being. Uh, so I went to Vietnam. Ended up being there for five years, and I don't remember the time, but it was oh 7 0 8, that's when, so the Beijing Olympics was 2008, and everybody's like, oh, this is like China's moment, right? So actually, I, I planned to move to Shanghai. I had a lot of buddies that were moving there, a lot of Caucasian dudes, and they're just like, we're just gonna learn Mandarin and like, we're gonna figure it out, right? And then I'm just like, wait a second. Like, I'm Vietnamese, like I can speak enough Vietnamese and I have family members. I'm just gonna Vietnam and try to ride the same like East Asia wave. And the, the, the running joke about Vietnam is it's always five years away. So any, any year you get the Vietnam, it's like, oh, we're five years away from being like the next Asian tiger. Right? But it's been that way for two decades. a lot of your listeners probably know me from being an idiot on Twitter and like being an idiot in terms of ship posting about business. Two things happened in Vietnam that was completely unplanned, but led kind of that route. So number one was, Uh, I, because I had no real hard skills. I, I, I'm like, okay, what course can I take remotely that I can just do? CFA was the easiest one, right? Is like the one that you can do. They test in Saigon. I'm like, I'm just gonna do this. Put a little discipline around my life and like work in a quote unquote real career. So I took the cfa and then the other thing I did in Vietnam is actually the thought, the thing I really wanted to do a decade ago was a be a comedy screenwriter. So I wrote and sold a comedy screenplay to Fox. I co-wrote that and I'm like, oh my God, this is amazing. I'm gonna be a comedy screenwriter. But I mean, I know that, you know, people in entertainment industry's like you write. Or, or option at script, you're still like at the 10 yard line in your own end zone, You got 90 yards to go and you have no control over the rest of that. Uh, so on and off for about three years. Um, uh, I thought I was gonna be able to make a movie and I never ended up happening. But, uh, tldr moved back to North America, uh, got a real job, quote unquote real job in, uh, FinTech. Worked for a FinTech firm you might have heard of. It's called Kensho. It's based in, uh, Boston, salt SMB Global in 2018. And, uh, and then from there, somebody I knew at Kensho was an early investor in the hustle, or, or an early-ish investor, and then made the introduction to the hustle. And then that's how I ended up going down this route of being like a more public facing writer, a business, uh, thingy. Greg: Okay. And the hustle, like, what was that experience? Trung: So the hustle was actually a very good. Match because it was like everything says like you, you know the tone of the hustle, right? You know Sam obviously, and the way they write is like, it's like an irreverent take on business. I'm like, okay, perfect. It combines my kind of interest in business with my real interest in comedy. And uh, it was super interesting the time I was there cuz it happened during Covid and we had a difficult patch where quite a bit of turnover. Probably not surprising anybody during that time and the writing staff for the actual, uh, daily newsletter. Cuz I mean, you write a weekly newsletter, right? You already know, like I write a weekly new newsletter. It's like it's already calling to difficult enough just like be on that grind. But like a daily newsletter, like, I mean, you know, Austin, you know Sam, the daily stuff is truly a seven day a week job if you're in the writer's seat, right? Because. At a minimum it's six days because you gotta hit all five days during the week, but you just never stop thinking about it cuz you just wake up like, oh crap. Like I gotta, I gotta make sure I got the next one. And it's honestly a recipe for burnout if you don't have like a team in place. Unless I had amazing editors, uh, a shifting kind of co-writers. But I'd say the experience that was great with the hustle was I'd never written at that cadence for that long. And I'm like, okay, well you can do this. I, I was feeling myself burning out towards the end. But it was nice to know that how much you can actually pump out if you just kind of have to do it right. And it was during Covid too, so , what else are you gonna do during Covid? Greg: It feels like there was a group of you that really took off, at the hustle, right? Like, I feel like you know Steph Smith and there's just a bunch of you, like what was in the water at the hustle that so many of you became successful. Trung: well, I mean you'll know this from knowing Sam is like, bring on board maybe non-traditional people. Right. And I mean, I think with Steph, he found Steph from her writing, uh, as like a solopreneur, like a no, a, a digital nomad, and was like, oh, this is just really good writing. Right. And, uh, it might not be a traditional Ivy League route, uh, former tech reporter, but, but interesting knows what it's like to be an entrepreneur and that's probably valuable for the entrepreneurs. So I think, um, it's probably a combination of having. Kind of a wider net of who would be allowed to work at the Hustle. Cause ultimately, our editor when I was there was Brad Wolverton. he was a former Washington Post guy. Right? Or like very traditional media. but he was able to wrangle in kind of more non-traditional writers. So, you know, I think a lot of credit goes to, uh, I think Brad was a really big hire, uh, for that team. He's still there. I believe he's running, uh, all of HubSpot's, uh, editorial stuff now. But non-traditional writing, which is very much like, uh, consistent with what's happened with Sub now, right? The best writers I know are not people that came up as journalists. The best writers are former industry people. Like, I mean, who's gonna outright community stuff or what your expertise is, right? Like, you're gonna be the best about that. Like a journalist is not gonna outdo you on that. And I think that applies to basically every kind of vertical now, although the, I flip flopped on how I feel about traditional medium. a bit of it is because I'm so in the tech Twitter bubble that I'm just like, oh, you know, screw the time, screw whatever, X, Y, Z. But the reality is that the actual reporting that we all riff on and write on like that is actually extremely difficult and very like time and financially, uh, intensive, right? Like even when you look at some of the best solo newsletter writers, I mean, they're just ripping off whatever the financial times are or New York Times or Bloomberg or, uh, wall Street Journal has written about, right? Because that's still ultimately the brass tack. Like you gotta still have that original reporting. So I, I'm, I think I'm at a middle ground now. I respect old media, but I, I do think that there, there's a lot of questions, uh, about, uh, their models and, and kind of their incentives now Greg: I mean, I write a weekly newsletter and I plan to even write more. And I couldn't even define the word reporting to you, like properly. Like I don't even know like how I should be citing sources and how I should be doing like good reporting, you know what I mean? Like I feel like so many people on, like me, we, we just have ideas and it's a platform to get our ideas out there Trung: the way I think about it is, you know, if you're gonna touch on the story, you literally have to call five to 10 people like that. To me, kind of what it really comes down to, right? Like the time it takes to set up these calls, chase people down and like get the primary source versus, you know, we're often riffing on these primary sources, right? Which is much less time intensive, but you add your own ideas, which obviously is cognitively difficult. Greg: Yeah. So I remember like earlier on in my career as an entrepreneur, I would get these dms from reporters being like, Hey, do you have 10 minutes or five minutes for a quick interview on something? And I'd get on the phone and it was just them like citing a source or doing a little extra research. And I remember like thinking to myself, like waking up on a Monday morning, let's just say, and you know, the meetings in the afternoon, I'm like, clear my day. I'm talking to someone from the New York Times, you know, just so excited. And I get on the call, they ask me a few questions if I'm lucky I'm getting a link, you know, back. Trung: right. Greg: and that's like best case or maybe like best case is actually linked back one sentence or two sentences. Realistically, I'm getting maybe a link and uh, I didn't realize at the time why they were so excited to speak to me, but now I understand it. Like they need to speak to me in order to properly get their piece across the finish line. Trung: Like, like you're giving them the, the inner workings, right? The inside baseball that they like, if, if they wrote it without your insights like that, that's just a, that's a, that's a wire piece from the ap, right? Like what's the point? They just go to AP for this. But like, you're giving like literally that one sentence where it's like, oh, here's an insight from entrepreneur. So what did, what did that make you feel about the process though? It was like you're saying, you're saying kind of even the playing field in your mind of like, who brings value. Greg: Yeah. It change, it changed the. The power dynamics, at least in my head. So initially I was like, okay, there's these gatekeepers and if I get them to write about me, there's a greater chance that I get customers, users, venture capital, potential, people who wanna buy my company. like might be reading the New York Times and might say, Hey, we need to buy this company cuz we saw it in the New York Times. Like, that's literally how deals get done a lot of the time. Like, we feel this is a threat cuz it's in the New York Times or whatever. . Trung: Wait, has this happened to you though? Like, uh, with your own personal entrepreneurial journey? Greg: yeah. Yes. Like Trung: Okay. . So somebody's like, I saw him in the Times. Oh, that, that's interesting, man. Greg: Yeah. Like I remember, I was trying to sell my company in 2013, it was called Five By to a social network called Stumble Upon. And I was just trying to get the. The term sheet, from Facebook at the time, stumble upon and there was a couple others, and I just needed a little extra juice, like an extra like reason for them to like move. So I hired Ed Zitron, uh, if you know Trung: Oh yeah. I've read Greg: yeah. And he, he got us in Tech Grudge and Trung: through industry connections. Greg: through industry connections. I paid him $5,000 to get us into Tech. Gru, basically, and Trung: Got you crossed the finish line. Dan, this is some inside baseball man. Have you ever told this story? Greg: Never told this story. Trung: This is amazing, man. Wow. That's Balder dude. Greg: it was published, let's say on a Monday, Tuesday, by Wednesday, Thursday. All of a sudden Facebook came around, stumble upon, came around, just so happened that they had read the article. and, uh, it makes it, it makes a difference to be in the press. Trung: I've been in a couple, uh, of conversations with, uh, kind of on the solo independent side and the idea being, Hey, how valuable is a traditional press? I think what you're saying here, oh, granted, this was 10 years ago, right? Greg: Yeah, Trung: I feel like it probably pulls the same weight though. Like I remember when I was, so I took a break from Bloomberg, but when I was writing over the past year, I still remember the kind of outreach you'd get and, oh, I guess on Twitter I have a big audience, but there's still some people that I couldn't reach out to over that I know from AB testing as in like when I reached out to them on my Twitter account, nothing when I'm like, Hey listen, I'm writing something to Bloomberg. Totally different ballgame, right? It's like it still means something to get into the terminal, for example. Or in your case, I guess TechCrunch is still, I mean 10 years later. Uh, I like your thoughts actually, TechCrunch now versus 10 years ago. What do you think the influence is or Greg: Oh, I mean, it's gone down significantly. significantly. At the time it was like, Trung: quench equivalent today Greg: it's gotten more decentralized. Like I feel like at the time it was, there was only a few places that you'd go for, for tech news. It was like Pando Daily, I think. Um, But there wasn't that much, right. Like tech felt like more niche and TechCrunch was like TechCrunch was the holy grail. Um, today I feel like You know, Paki McCormick, you have Lenny Subs, you have like more niche, Mario. Ben's bites for ai or we just launched one called you probably need a robot.com for ai. Like, there's these niche gatekeepers, um, that exist. so the attention is way, way more spread out. Trung: Yeah, that's a great point. Regarding, uh, Paki and Mario Ash, you, because you've obviously seen some of their. Quote unquote sponsor deep dives or even ones that aren't right, is the, they clearly are just hitting the exact market. And to your point, that where tech Hunts used to serve. But I mean, pa I think PA's up to 200,000 subs, and I know Lenny's is, Lenny's is massive, right? Lenny might be half a million at this point Greg: Lenny is the second most subscribed CK period. Trung: in the, in the entire, on the entire platform. It That is wild. Right? That is absolutely wild. He's a new tech crunch. There you go. Right. He's a new tech crunch legitimately. Greg: Yeah. Lenny is the new tech wrench, but he, he focuses more on like But you're right, Lenny, in some ways is, is the closest thing to the new tech wrench that we have. going back to your story, you're at the hustle. What happens? How long are you there for? Trung: About a year, year and a half. Like I said, like a little bit of burnout feeling when, uh, when, uh, the daily, the daily pace for about a year was fast. It was a lot. I wanted to get back to writing, uh, longer kind of stuff. and I mean, you know, the deal ha, the HubSpot acquired Hustle in February, 2021. Uh, within a year I think a lot of, uh, a lot of people had ended up leaving, uh, which is pretty typical for these type of things anyways. And, uh, I knew that I wanted to get back, uh, to kind of writing at a, at a less frequent pace and also just explore the stuff that we've talked about, like being more, being more solo and independent and kind of seeing where it, where where you can go. I mean, you'll know this, you've been over a decade. It's just like, I prefer taking on random opportunities, uh, and not being tied necessarily to one place. Uh, just because a lot of it has to do with the fact that have built up good distribution. Right. Um, it was a little bit different maybe than a year and a half ago, but as you're building up a distribution and you see, okay, well, N that's half the battle in my eyes with the content. It, it literally is how, how much effort you put into the writing of the, the initial thing or creating that piece, you have to put the exact same amount of effort in distribution. Right. And well, that's why people make the trade off. They're willing to work for a large publication because they don't believe that they can do the distribution on their own. But you can actually can, as you can tell, as you know, from your group, the a hundred K club, it's possible to happen. So just wanna get off the pace of the writing. I've never really stayed at a place for, uh, extended amount of time and I still have this north star in my head of being a film like writer of some nature. And what I found with writing independently and kind of using that as the main outlet was, you know, I do get a lot of interesting dms. I meet a lot of interesting people just from what I do on Twitter and, um, you know, moving the ball towards creatively stuff I want to do like. A lot of stuff for me is, even though I kind of work in the business world, I'm like, the things that get me excited are the more on the creative side, particularly humor. Greg: So what are you working on? And it feels like you have some interest in film writing, ai. Um, how does it all come together? What's your, how do you describe what you're building? Trung: Here's the through line. The through line is this is, I know what I'm gonna be doing every day, basically for the next call, five, 10 years. Like I can already see it, right? It, it has to do with the age of my kid where he's five years old. So, you know, no matter what, I know that, uh, you know, the commitment, obviously a kid, right? So that's the main thing. It's like, that's levering me in. It's like, okay, so how do I build something I can do for 10 years around the fact that I gotta raise my kid for another 10, 15 years? Right? And what that is, and what I've come to realize over the past year and a half was, I know I can just do the content paste that, uh, some of your listeners might see, or if they're not familiar is like, you know, I'll, I'm on Twitter every day, a couple hours similar to yourself. Uh, I'm, I'll write a newsletter, I do a podcast, and it's just solely building the audience as you know. It's like It just, it just compounds, right? It's just corny. But like, it, the benefits especially of audience building is all gonna be towards the end, right? It's like, uh, I wrote about it this last week. Uh, Jack Butcher, who you had on recently on the show, he obviously has that amazing visual, right? Of like, it's just a straight line going nowhere, and then it just kind of implodes and, and, and there's a point on that straight line where you're like, oh, this is pointless. But it's just the idea of particularly audience building, uh, the, the benefits really do accrue towards the end, right? In, in so many ways too. It's like the, you're picking up more people, but then the people you're picking up earlier than the journey, they wanna see you win and they're liking you more because of how much time they're spending with you. When you're asking like, you know, where's the through line? The through line is this, I know I can keep doing the audience stuff, like content that I enjoy for the indefinite amount of time. So through that, through line then becomes okay, if you have a big audience, what can you do with that? So the AI stuff was essentially, you know, I'd advertise in my newsletter, I'd advertise in my podcast, but a lot of those advertisements weren't even products that I used. And the, the highest value thing for somebody with a big audience, it's like, you know, you own the product, right? It's like, it's like whatever Jocko does with his, health products or Rogan now has a cotton like on it, right? It's like you find a product that you can, uh, use your distribution to sell. The AI stuff made sense to me. the app that I launched barely ai, I actually use it quite a bit. I use it a ton to copyedit my own stuff. I don't have a team, so, uh, writing and editing are two such different kind of, uh, you know, the cognitive switch is quite large and it's really annoying to edit your stuff. So I use, uh, uh, barely, which is built on top of water. Uh, any, it can be on top of any large language model. Obviously opening has a big one right now, but we can, we've plugged into other ones and. I'm sure Google is gonna release one soon. I I, I know Facebook or Meta just released theirs. It's like, we're gonna be able to route through this app, which essentially, uh, I guess they call it a thin wrapper, but the thin wrapper with, uh, two ways I put it is I think the UX and the convenience side. I know you've talked about it previously and used it and maybe a little bit, but I think the, what we're seeing was that the convenience side is if the underlying models are gonna be largely commoditized because every browser will have it, like every productivity tool will have it is people will be like, okay, well which one will I actually use every day? Because it's convenient. Right? And we're finding, like we have the Chrome extension, uh, the one short, uh, one keyboard shortcut, uh, app, and uh, obviously browser access, people are liking that it's all kind of in one place. And, uh, there's definitely enough of a market for those individuals where, uh The lifetime value for this product is higher than I can get on just ads. So Greg: Yeah, I, I was just in a meeting with my team right before this, and I think we're launching like five companies over the ne you know, over the next six weeks, so around my distribution. Trung: Exactly. Greg: I think it's, it's a good point that you have, which is once you're known for something, once you're 1%, how do you become the advertiser So, with the ai, with barely ai, like you were relatively early with that, how did you get into ai, LLMs and productivity? Trung: So, uh, but I'm gonna have to give a lot of credit to my co-founder, Parham. Uh, we worked together at Kero, which was the, uh, FinTech startup, uh, that I mentioned, uh, that I worked when I came outta the States. But he was head of infrastructure there. So I mean, he'd spent his entire career, like a decade, basically plugging at the time it was a lot of data, like a lot of NASDAQ data s and p data, into kind of a, a nice UX and making it very usable. And the l l m stuff was kind of creeping up. Uh, obviously chat, GP t's model underlying model had been around for almost 18 months and they just kind of slapped it on top. And, uh, I, I'm sure you've read the stuff they didn't, even outside of Sam Alman, they didn't even think that it'd be a success. They're like, they, they, they, they were rushing it out the door cuz they knew that the moment was coming for Mindshare and they just kind of rushed it out. Um, so I don't think we were particularly early. Like, I mean, Jasper and copy were around probably a year plus, uh, before we launched and now everything was just swept away by chat G B T anyways in terms of, uh, uh, Mindshare. But what, what I will say is like, it is definitely one of those situations where like, you know, the tide lifts all boats. It's just the, the biggest tide ever. And even chat, G P T and Open AV acknowledged there's just no way they could. All the different, uh, uh, customers they want. So they did that deal with Bain recently, right? To to, to do, uh, generative text and images for Coca-Cola. But like in that press release, they're the, they're like . We can't, like, we're doing one of the Fortune 500 companies, like a single one of them. Right. And I think the economics for OpenAI and Microsoft, uh, which obviously owns about, we will end up owning 45, 40 9% of it is they're gonna have to be kind of a cloud provider and they're gonna want as many people to plug in as possible. So I guess their balancing act, which I'd love to your thoughts on, is you know, how, how do they have a balancing app between having their own product and trying to incentivize just everybody to build on top of it? So, we were, I don't think we were particularly early. I do think that we got in right before that crazy rush to be honest, it was, it was when Chat G B T came out that first week, I'm like, fuck this might, like we might be done. And uh, but then we saw Ashley that it really helped clarify what our value was is just some people want the UX a certain way, right? That's just how some people want it. And that clarified for us is like, okay, let's, this is our market. We're not building the next Google. We need to find 10, 20,000 of these customers and get 'em to pay. And then you have a mid seven figure business am I trusting that my distribution can do that? So those are kind of the, that was kind of the equation. So what, when, what, what do you think when like around, um, kind of thin wrappers and, and open AI competing against potential other, other AI plays? Greg: So my take on. like where we are in the state of AI and building on top of it is, it feels very similar to how it was in mobile. Um, so in mobile, basically what happened was, you bought an iPhone and there were default apps. Like there was no, you know, the first version of the iPhone didn't have an app store, Trung: Oh yeah. Steve Jobs hated the idea of an app store cuz he didn't want an app to drop the call because I don't remember. But in his is in, in the iPhone presentation, he's like the killer app for the iPhone is the A phone call. We've created a better phone call. So he was fucking really didn't wanna ruin the phone. But yeah, you're right. There was no app store. Greg: no app store, and it got preloaded with some default apps based on what they thought people wanted. And Apple knew a few of those apps because from, you know, 2000 to. 2008. There was a huge industry around pocket PCs, which were just mobile windows and palm pilots that we like often forget about. So, they understood that there was notes that you needed, you know, photos, maps, Email Exactly. So they knew that that's the phase we're in right now with, open AI's business. And then you're gonna see Google, uh, as well. Um, so they've identified okay, text to image makes sense. Boom, Dolly, you know, jukebox music. they've, they've identified like the, and I hate the term, but low hanging fruit for the space. today, you know, we're, we're, we're recording this, February 27th. Today I saw that Snap added, like ai, open AI integration. so now they're moving from like default apps to okay partner apps that we can trust. The next step is platform. So the app store for open ai or the app store for Google Bard. And yeah, what you're building is like, you're building an app before , before there's an app store basically. Trung: Right. Greg: you're, instead of relying on the distribution for an app store, you're relying on the distribution of your Twitter account and email, et cetera. and I think that there's gonna be like open AI and Google isn't gonna figure out themselves how to build every niche. AI based product, and they don't want to do that. So I think there's gonna be a huge opportunity over the next five years to like go and build a seven figure AI first product. Trung: I, I love that framing of the idea of, uh, they basically figured out, so the first iPhone came with 60 naps, like kind of everything you mentioned notes, email, browser, uh, contact list. The idea of like, and a great parallel here is like the open AI playground, right? Or the, uh, the, the text playground. It's like, that's kind of the first tool you'll see everywhere is it's probably just gotten a meeting with three people and they're just like, Hey, what are, like, what are the main things we can do with text? We just created 20 of them, right? And, um, apart from the use. Different use cases you might have with the LLMs. The other thing we've seen with barely is, so we've been reached out quite a bit by s like SMB corporates, n not even tiny, like 10, 20,000 employees. They want to integrate some type of ll m into their company, but they don't wanna do through chat G P T right now. And then open AI just doesn't have the resources to hold their hands because they're too small. Right. So barely is actually very effective in the sense of, you know, we're working on the standard corporate stuff like sso, single sign-on, uh, localize all, all data so you can upload and just keep it, uh, OnPrem or like not in a cloud. Because people obviously have a lot of, uh, concerns about privacy and uh, we've seen enough outreach of that where, you know, if anybody listening here, and I'm sure there are quite a bit interested in AI, is like the one thing I cannot stress enough is the market is so big. Even though like the mental gymnastics I went through and like, kind of like the anxiety when a chat g p T came out was just, it just came to mind. It's like, listen, they're just not gonna be able to service everybody because it doesn't make sense for them too. And it's like what you said, a, they're not gonna be able to figure out every use case B, they're not gonna be able to service everyone. There's gonna be enough room for a lot of people. Maybe not generational stuff. Right? Like, I don't know how many Googles or Ubers, Airbnbs will come out of this uh, cycle, but it's great for solopreneurs. There's no question about it. Greg: how much anxiety does being built on open ai, Google, whatever, give you you know, cuz they could just decide, we're no long, longer giving access to, you know, chat g p t or, or they could just say it's gonna cost a million dollars a month. Trung: it was a lot more anxiety when chat g BT came out in November, but it seems pretty clear since then, uh, that there's gonna be enough competition in this space. I mean, even stability, right? Like stability obviously is known for, uh, stability. AI is primarily known for stability of fusion, but they're working on a large language model and, and, and, and their whole, their whole ethos is to be open source. Right? And then you just saw, again, we mentioned meta drop one last week. Google has to drop. I, I know meta is more research focused right now and they're, they have an open it widely, but there's almost no question that Google is probably going to have to within this year. So Yeah, I mean, it is scary, it's scary in the same sense that I believe it the way you'd use a cloud provider is like, yeah, could. You know, screw you by jacking up prices and like making it really expensive. I think it's called egress fees when you have to leave the cloud. That's basically what they're doing. Uh, but, uh, the tradeoffs are worth it and I mean, otherwise, like, I'm not gonna be able my old own l m either, right? So the reality is that I'm screwed if they really do pull that So, although there have been enough discussions where like, like are we gonna have to just do, or, or like enough, or like an interesting one enough where you can still do something super niche and uh, and kind of exist, but yeah, definitely anxiety, but I think it was much less diminished than in November. That was a true shot. Like when, when Chad came out, the information had a great article about Jasper. So Jasper AI was the, you probably know the guy, he's like, unicorn, uh, ai, uh, startup that does a lot of copy and marketing, uh, text. But I read that information article. . And so they're in like a Slack group, uh, like a, a, a multi cross-functional slack group with open ai because they're such a big partner. And then when Chad TPG dropped, they're like, Hey, uh, what's going on? Like, this is like directly competitive and you know, the opening guy. Like, no, no, no, don't worry about it. It's like you guys, you still have access to the different models and uh, it's just, it is just like a, just a marketing point for open ai. But, if they're raised at 1.5 billion, like what was the ambition for that company? It's probably a 10 billion plus company, right? Like, is that still possible? I, I don't know. it seems scary that Chatt PDDs out there and Microsoft can burn X amount of money. but I think the market is just so massive that, uh, it's worthwhile for them not to screw people and they'll just make up money, uh, on whatever their, their token model ends up being. Greg: Yeah, I think people really underestimate how big the AI market is because what is ai? It lifts productivity, it uplifts productivity. So if you uplift productivity 7%, like we're talking trillions per, per year globally Trung: product productivity. And, and this is another thing that we've found with barely AI, is like, so about half of our usage is outside of North America. I don't think people understand the multiplier that open AI provides for non-native English speakers that are trying to compete and, and not even necessarily compete. Just even just like, listen, I don't know how much you've dealt with, uh, uh, people in Southeast Asia or East Asia. I'm sure you have quite a bit. It's like first of all, English. The English teaching industry is massive. It's just absolutely massive. Right. And that's just to teach English. Not even to write. Not even to read. It's just to teach the pronunciation of English. And if you throw something like chat, p t, open ai, any large language models now. Yeah. People that are, have all the other skills, right. Discipline, uh, understand, uh, accounting, understand finance, understand how to use the internet. But the truly large barrier was, uh, writing literally just good emails. You could even write a good cold email if you were like a, a, a Vietnamese executive because you just don't have intonation and you just don't understand the nomenclature. Right? This is a massive change for you. It is truly a massive change. We're seeing huge usage in Southeast Asia for, uh, barely ai. And even though our pricing is Western based for some companies over there, it's a no-brainer for them. It's not ex, I mean it's expensive relative to like how the per g d p per capita, but if you're running a business that can do seven figures from Southeast Asia, it's a no-brainer to be able to communicate properly for $200 a year, $20 a month, right? So I think that's the other part of it. Totally agree with you on the productivity, but I think the massive unlock is gonna. Even the playing field in a lot of ways for, for non-native English speakers. And, uh, we had a, it was funny, we, I do a non-investment advice podcast with Baal and, uh, Jack and we , we randomly had a, a sailor on last year, Michael Sailer, and he had a great line. He's just like, whatever you do, you can sell for more in English. Like if that's, you know, the, the language you're interacting, obviously he's a lingua Franco and he's like, and whatever you buy, you can buy it for cheaper in English. And I think that matters a lot. Like, forget about just the productivity, which I totally agree on. Like 7% boost, like you said, we're trillions of dollars or whatever hypothetical number, right? But the unlocking of literally two to 3 billion people to compete in where the lingua Franco of, uh, the internet, which is English. I think it's a huge, and, and we can't really compute what the opportunity is for that. Greg: obviously, I speak English, but growing up in Quebec, like, you know, you speak English and French and you're in North America, so you kind of like see, you understand us, you understand selling into the us. but you also understand that, You might speak French as your native, you know, 93% of Quebec speak French, uh, as their first language. So for me, like I've always thought about like, how do you, how do you localize different products and niche, different products, like barely AI for, you know, Vietnam for example, could be a huge product and, and I just find that Americans don't think often like that. They don't think like, oh, hey, let's, like, they just think about like, if, you know, if you make it in New York, you make it everywhere, right? Like, that's like the, the mentality. But I don't think that's necessarily true, I, I, I believe in, speaking to different audiences and the way they want to be spoken to. So I think there's a ton of opportunity in just creating. Proven products that are AI first and just focusing it on non-western countries. Trung: Well, let me, let me use an example from, I mean, you, you, you had a viral thread a couple days ago around, uh, I think a vendor owed you $109,000 Greg: 109. 109. 500. But who's counting? Trung: Yeah. So you, so a vendor owed you six figures. It's call, it's call a hundred k And I asked you while I was reading it, I mean, the solution ended up being very simple. It was like you, you prompted chat, G D P T to give you an email to send hypothetically to a vendor that owed you X amount of money, hadn't paid in a y amount of time. Right. Like, simple enough. But I think there's an insight in there, and I think, uh, it's y it kind of went viral, right? Last time I saw it was like 12,000 likes or something, which is millions of, uh, impressions. But like, I think the insight there was something, and you, you touched on it. It was like the idea. It's good. Call it back off, right? Like, yeah, I could have written that email. I could have written it, but there's mental blockers for you to write that email. I think that, so for the listeners that haven't seen any, the, the texted email was something along the lines of, you know, hey, vendor X, like, uh, we've given you five months, uh, to, to pay this bill and we much appreciate it if you pay. If not, here's some records. Right? Like, you literally could have written that, but the mental blocker to be like, fuck, do I wanna be the bad guy? Like, dude, you know what I mean? It's like, do I really wanna do No, but I want you to apply that. Think about that mental blocker that you as a west, a successful western entrepreneur had, right? To write that English. Email now, now apply that to the 700,000, the 700 million Southeast Asians, right? Imagine trying to write an angry email from like your Malaysia manufacturer. You're trying to get a, a, a, a New York based company to pay you six figures. Where do you even start to communicate that properly? But like you, I think that's what the beauty about that like, it was such a simple solution, but I don't think people understand the implications of it. So literally now, , you can have angry emails that are effective, written and sound like a lawyer. He, he, hell, this might be a bad thing, but now anybody can do it. But I think it's a great equalizer. Greg: I mean, a lot of our team is based in Canada, so obviously they're super nice and they're, they're just like, they're just like following Trung: email. Greg: Well, they, they were basically like, you know, responding to that, you know, that vendor and just being like, Hey, just following up would be awesome to get paid. You know, it's just like, it needed like a bit more, oomph. Exactly. It was missing some oomph. And, uh, they asked for my advice and I was just like, chat g p T. Like, um, you know, initially they were like, we're gonna give it to the lawyer and let the lawyer just like handle it. And at the time we were like, we're over budget that month. On, legal fees. I was, yeah. I was just like, let's just tr let's do a fun experiment. And we did it. And I just, I got that notification like 95 seconds after I sent the email, from the executive of that company. And he is like, yeah, sure, no problem. We'll pay you. I was like, Trung: you, you knew it was good content too, right? Because I know you're a content guy. You're like, Ooh, this is good content. Greg: yeah. Totally. yeah, I was telling, uh, someone on my team, I was like, it's worth, it's worth the money just on the content alone. Trung: I'm just forget the hundred and nine. I mean, dude, I was looking, uh, uh, cause I don't know, l let, uh, this is specific for the users that aren't super Twitter heavy, but kind of the way you plug your products on Twitter is after like a long multi tweet thread and, and, and kind of conversion is typically whatever you can convert 10% of, uh, likes from the first tweet to the bottom. Like, you've done a great job. I was looking at some of the likes towards the end, like, damn dude, this is like, this converted really well Greg: Oh yeah. I mean, I'll share some of that inside info. Like, you know, one of the things I launched in that thread, or put in that thread is a design service called dispatch. Trung: 5k. Greg: Yeah. 5k a month. I put, like in the tweet. I was like, Hey, listen, like this inspired us to, to launch this product that like we actually get paid. you pay us 5K a month and it's unlimited designs for your company. And it's like landing pages and websites and apps unlimited for, for only 5K a month. And from that tweet alone, you know, that'll generate, six figures in a r r just from that tweet. For, for Trung: listening, did you actually launch it because of that thread, Greg: yeah, so Trung: that in the works? Greg: we had it as an idea. We're just kind of like, hey, like, a lot of companies, we, we just had a request, like a lot of companies just need, you know, our, our short staffed, but they weren't like small design tasks and they weren't right for our like, traditional design agency. we've just been referring it to other agencies cuz we're just like, hey, it's not a fit, not a. they were like, Hey, wouldn't it be cool to have like a monthly subscription? and it was, it was on the back burner. Um, and then when that happened, I was like, Hey, great forcing function to bring that back. Imagine if we can get, you know, six figures a month or even seven figures every single month being charged. And it's, you know, not, you know, we work with a lot of Fortune 500 s, it's, you know, net 30, net 60, et cetera. Trung: Well, there you go. You need 20, you need 20. And I looked at, it's not shocking at all that you got at least 20, because I looked at, man again, it's this inside baseball for people don't use Twitter. It's like, you can kinda do like a rough hand conversion of like, likes to like clicks. And I'm like, whew, this, this thread was like , like, that's hilarious, man. So like this thread, you put a literal hit on every single level. There's like five layers of winning here, Greg: And it, and it generated thousands of subscriptions to you. Probably need a robot.com. Trung: Yeah. Yeah, exactly right. Um, yeah, so I'm curious then, so for you, cuz I, I mean you obviously jumped quickly on different, uh, different, uh, ideas that you think ha are, you know, quite large, uh, potential. And outside of the ones you kind of mentioned, uh, kind of the community, the newsletter, are you looking at doing a lot more AI stuff, uh, around products that you, because you said you launched five to 10 a year, Greg: Yeah, Trung: companies in the works Greg: yeah, yeah. So well, I've been in, in some form into AI for a long time. So like my co-founder and I have late checkout, you know, I mentioned Stumble upon, like, stumble upon was like the og, you know, personalization and AI company. Yeah. So that's how I got into ai. and, and also I studied computer science at McGill. Shout out McGill again, I learned a little from that. And yeah, for those of you who don't know, stumble upon, it was basically like a, you know, you put your interest in and you press a button and it would serve you interesting webpages based on some AI and ml. kind of similar to how like the TikTok for you page really works. Um, but for webpages, so I've been interested in a wa you know, for a while, but, you know, with all this, buzz over the last 12 to 18 months and a lot of our clients asking us for AI product designs, I just wanted to build like a free community. because my belief is like if you attract the smartest people into a community and you have like, you know, workshops with them and masterminds with them, you get to know them. Like you, even if you're not an expert, you can become an expert. So the fastest way to learn is to start a community, in my opinion. And, I wanted that for my team as well. So from that, I think we're gonna build a lot of AI stuff. Trung: a lot of the difficulties in AI is, is not necessarily specific to ai. Right? Like, again, you're not gonna build probably a large language model. The challenges is distribution, packaging, and I mean, this is your area of expertise, right? Like this is, and distribution packaging is literally like what you do. but you worked at TikTok, right? Greg: Yeah, I was an advisor to TikTok. Trung: Okay. Because of the stumble. Oh. Cuz I would Greg: because it's, Trung: Oh, Greg: yeah, Well, yeah, actually the reason why is because I had built like this app five by that got acquired. Um, it was this video discovery app similar to how TikTok worked. and TikTok hired when TikTok, after it was re rebranded to TikTok from Musically, they hired a bunch of YouTube execs, basically. Um, and I knew a lot of those YouTube execs from my five by days. So they brought me in to help them YouTube fi and grow TikTok because at the time it was an app for like 12 year old girls. Trung: so we need to ask then we got, we're gonna, there's a big elephant in this room. Should the United States ban TikTok, gimme your honest Greg: Should the United States ban TikTok, Trung: or force a sale. Greg: what do you think? Trung: You too close to this one. Greg: What do you. Trung: Oh yeah. I think there's no question I, I've written about this. I think they should, they should ban and then force a sale. Um, my logic. It was a little cold war, but The analogy, use this, if this was the 20th century, it'd be like they, if the Soviet Union owned b, abc, cbs, or b nbc, right, like one of the three big television stations that had access to hundreds of millions of Americans. And this is what TikTok is, and I'm not, I'm not saying that there's every single day someone I, uh, within the c ccp, it's like going into TikTok saying like, do X, Y, Z. But we've seen with Chinese tech and Chinese industry, sometimes you don't even have to say it's, it's understood what you need to do. Right. And, uh, I mean, ye Ying, the former, I meant the, I guess he stepped down as a c e O of by dance or still chairman, very involved, was he had to apologize for the, the, I don't remember pronounce it, Tut, the newspaper app. He's like, yeah, CCP is like, we're not liking the content here. So we had to make a huge public apology. So they need the force of sale. I'll tell you what's funny. Obviously there's only like five or six companies in America that can buy TikTok, but I think it's gonna end up being owned by Microsoft, which will just, Satia is already the biggest animal ever and he is gonna own TikTok. Right. And he is gonna probably buy for like 30 billion. Uh, I think that will be the outcome. So I don't know what you feel about that, but yeah, I don't, I don't think it should be owned by , by a, Chinese company with a CCP on the board. Greg: I mean, I agree. I have to agree with you, . I think Google or Microsoft, but I, like it can happen to meta because anti competition antitrust, right. Um, it could happen to Disney. Disney could buy it. Trung: Oh, that's interesting because Disney actually looked at buying Twitter in 20, uh, 7, 20 16. I think they had a term sheet, everything was ready and then Iger like woke up one day is like, I don't wanna deal with this fucking, I don't wanna deal with the moderation bullshit that's going on there. Greg: Google is interesting because then they own like short form TikTok and, and longer form YouTube, Netflix, of course Trung: Actually, let's game this out. I'm making a prediction. YouTube is gonna buy TikTok, they're gonna spin out YouTube, it's gonna go public. 500 billion company done Greg: I love Trung: this, editor. Clip this from when this happens in the next 12 months. Greg: No, I, I think, uh, I think that makes sense. I also think Satya buying TikTok, integrating open AI and then turning it into a super app That's Trung: it'd be the, it's undefeated. He's , that's it. Right. Just go off in the sunset then. What, what, what other purpose do you have to exist? Like, sat, go retire after that, man. Greg: Yeah, totally. dude, this has been fun. I gotta, I gotta run, but this is, this is, Trung: Greg, I do appreciate the time, man. That was awesome, dude. Greg: Come back anytime. Uh, where could folks follow you on Twitter and, Trung: Yeah. Greg: also. Trung: Yeah. Uh, we keep super, super simple. Everything's on my Twitter bio strong T fan on Twitter. Uh, non-investment advice with, uh, Jack Butcher who, uh, was previously on Greg's show. And then, uh, Bizadi and, uh, yeah, barely. AI is b e a r l y.ai. Uh, free to use to try and, uh, if it's in your UX wheelhouse, I, I get a lot of dopamine with new signups. So, uh, think about that Greg: I love it. Go follow him. Thanks, trg. Trung: Yeah, absolutely, man. Thanks, Greg: Later.

all right Josh welcome welcome I'm I'm so excited to to speak to you yeah yeah it's a pleasure man it's really weird when you're a fan of a product and then you meet the founder so I'm I'm you know I've been watching consuming Bigger Pockets for years and you're the founder of that um so it feels good to to get to know you yeah yeah for sure well that's that's great to hear I I love when I run across people who I never in a million years would have thought were uh were fans of our product and and uh so yeah it's uh it's always special and I'm and I'm very appreciative to be here one of the reasons why I'm I really like Bigger Pockets and why I wanted to bring you on the show and I'm also just curious what what you're up to these days um Is Bigger Pockets is kind of like the OG Community Based product um it's now like a very in style to be to wrap Community around your product and we talk a lot about it on this podcast but um for folks who don't know what Bigger Pockets is and why it's a community-based product can you just explain what it is sure so Bigger Pockets I founded 18 18 or so years ago I was um I was a new real estate investor trying to be successful um just you know looking for ways to make money on the side while working a full-time job and um I I ran into all these problems um so you know when you when you buy a property as a landlord you have no idea what you're going to face you just you don't have a clue and the books don't really tell you what you're gonna run across and and so 18 years ago I went out and said hey you know I'm smart enough I if you know I graduated from college you know I I pretty pretty reasonably intelligent human being let me go buy some rental property you know it seems like it's it's pretty basic and and so I did that I bought some property in the Midwest and the numbers seem to be very good and I thought I was going to make a lot of money and um you know and and provide a service at the same time and help people out and give them a nice clean um comfortable place to live um but unfortunately like I said things happen right and and so um what do you do when um you have a vacancy it's somebody moves in and starts ripping all the copper out of the walls like that they don't have a book for that answer that question what do you do when you know the the air conditioning uh compressors keep getting stolen how do you handle that situation what do you do when tenants you know are leaving piles and piles of trash in the back room again more questions and and the only way I thought to get answers to those questions was to talk to other people and so I had back in college I started building websites and I I had this Epiphany hey what if there was a community around real estate investing so I went and I looked and there were actually communities but the issue I had with those communities was I believed that they were all built around the upsell they were all built around trying to um the community I I felt wasn't pure I felt like you know if I asked a question maybe I'd get an answer but the the answer was always going to be a lead-in to some kind of sales pitch um not only from the people who were running the communities but also from the participants of the communities and so for me I just felt like I didn't feel like they offered the Purity that I expected in the community so I set out to build my own um started putting together resources that I thought would be helpful uh just tools and resources that I could find collate the information and then I started to build a um a forum and fast forward I'll take you through it really really fast but fast forward um eight years later I decided I was on total burnout from doing this completely by myself in addition with an outsourced uh developer hired my first employee year eight um uh by year 14 I had an exit to private equity and I've been on the board uh for the last you know four plus years now uh helping our current CEO who was my number two uh when I stepped down and so we built a community today I think it's two and a half three million members we built um the most popular real estate podcast on iTunes still a top 10 business show on iTunes and then we built out multiple uh other podcasts and other categories related uh we bought it we built up a book business so I think we've now got 40 to 45 titles and we're one of the largest independent Publishers so Bigger Pockets is all things um for folks who are looking to build wealth um specifically through real estate and and whether you know whether you've been doing it for 30 years or you've been doing it you know just thinking about doing it there's something there there is a community of people uh to help you and and uh be there to to Hold Your Hand and was that your vision from day one like from day one did you envision books podcasts forums or like what was your vision when you started this quote-unquote Pierce there was no vision no it's so the vision was I'm failing I'm not you know like I am failing yeah I I walked into one of my units and there was there was a hole in the kitchen floor like like you know not not like a mouse hole like a hole that a human could fall through and so like like it's absurd absurd stuff that like what do you do so I I needed help and I figured there had to be a way to bring everybody together so so that was the first Vision was like let me bring people together um to help me it was totally selfish from day one um but what happened was over time little by little very very little by very very little um people were actually answering questions people were helping one another out and I was like oh wait this isn't just about me getting help people are helping one another wow this is this is cool so you know when I had that realization I said well we've got a craft guidelines we've got to craft rules around how this community is going to operate because if we don't we will become that which you know I built this to to be different from right and um you know almost instantly when when people see an opportunity to do ad they're going to do bad unfortunately right and and bad is not necessarily bad bad is just being opportunistic right so you know very quickly we had people Shilling and soliciting on on the community and you know bam we had to create a rule for that you can't do that you know we had people doing all sorts of things um so you know as we went along and as we learned we we crafted guidelines to help make the community safe um really starting from you know treat each other well don't be don't be an [ __ ] you know we had a no [ __ ] rule um and really I think one of the coolest and most important things was you know it doesn't because when you run it uh to pretty much any Community you'll see like the experience guys always like there'll be like a new question that comes out and they'll be like well have you gone and read you know all the other Forum questions have you searched you know don't be lazy you know and sorry but it's kind of a dick move in in my view like maybe they did maybe they missed it maybe it didn't come through on search or whatever it was like just answer the question just be helpful right or gently or kindly Point somebody in the right direction instead of being snarky right so I wanted a place that felt good for me to be I wanted a place that felt good for people to hang out on and we got that and we built that and you know it took a very long time um and I had lots and lots of other uh people in the space who as they saw our success would try and replicate it but you know ultimately enforcing those rules is really hard and you get a lot of people who push back against them and you know in order to be successful you have to stand up for what's right and that's what we did yeah yeah and I think you know a lot of people have ideas for products or communities they want to build and they get caught up with okay I need to have this feature and that feature and I need this and you know I need all the rules and and the what you're saying which I think is really important the Insight one of the instance I'm getting from you is you don't need to have all the answers on day one as long as you're open to you know iterating adding changing moving as you learn yeah absolutely and and look I mean I started with like a I'm gonna get a little nerdy here a PHP BB you know open source Forum built in PHP um and was modifying it to kind of have the design and features that I wanted and until I got to a point where I was like oh there's this really cool site called Myspace and they built these profiles wow imagine having profiles in a forum Community wait let's do that right and so um what I did was I went from very narrow and then I I said I'm gonna try and kind of replicate all the features of of what they've got hired a team out of India and um you know I didn't know how to code I was a hack right I didn't know how to code very well and so I hired these guys and they they did what I told them and nothing more and nothing less and that left me with a product that you know had a lot a lot a lot of problems they they delivered it to me and it didn't work and I could have just said all right well I'm out of business I spent all my money and instead I said well let me go back to step one and let me you know let me start iterating what's the next thing I want beyond um just the the community The Forum oh profiles cool so let's just create a basic profile you know and then we added blog software and then we added you know all these other features to it um so to go back to two questions um I did not have this vision of like this big thing that that came with time as I realized what was possible and and what's interesting about that is this um you know probably a year three maybe three or four um I went went and talked to a couple Venture capitalists um in Denver where I was living about it and um you know ask them hey what do you think about this you know what what can we do with this or you know is this something that is fundable and they both tell me to just shut it down they you know they said there's no this has no legs you know there's there's no need for something like this and you know I was like thank you very much it went home thought about it was like these guys are wrong they're completely wrong um you know because I saw it I saw the need I saw the community I saw the um and what they had done was they looked they probably looked at like hey what is the current market of users for communities that are in real estate and they're like well that's a small pile whereas I looked at it as what is the market for people who want to grow their wealth what is the market for people who don't love their job or would like some Financial Freedom wait that's a huge Market we could Target those people we can Market to those people and we can really become something special and and that's what happened I also think you know with community-based products like Bigger Pockets it's not uncommon to sell those businesses for eight or nine figures which is incredible and life-changing for those teams but to venture capitalists who look at it and like okay I'm gonna invest in like you know I'm looking for billion dollar exits I'm looking for billion dollar exists and it's kind of like you know if you're getting if you're listening to this and you're getting no's from VCS it doesn't mean you a lot of people assume you're getting a no from a VC means you don't have a viable business and I think that's completely incorrect absolutely it's you don't have a viable you you potentially don't have a viable Venture scalable business but maybe you don't even want a venture scalable business correct yeah and I I never I never took a penny from anyone um you know I started with my four dollar a month hosting and that was that was the only money I ever applied into that business was the first four bucks and then the next four bucks and the next four bucks but like beyond that I I bootstrapped the entire thing and it took a very which is why it took eight years to hire my first employee um and and you know I I struggled and suffered through a lot I mean building a community is very it's very hard getting adoption is really really hard and and you know one of the things I I tend to rant about occasionally um is everybody today has their own Community hey I've got my community join our community like you know having a Facebook page is not a community it's a Facebook page like it's a social media profile like my to me and again I'm I'm a bit of a purist on this stuff like a community is in a community even when you're interacting with your fans that's not a community either a community becomes a community I believe when you're you're interacting with your fans and they're interacting amongst themselves unguided you know they're starting uh conversations they're they're talking about things between one another I think that's the point at which you've got a community and if we're going to go and look at how many communities actually exist out there it's a very small number yeah I think it's one of the biggest mistakes a lot of people make is the difference between an audience and a community and it really grinds my gears honestly is when I see people using the word Community instead of audience it grinds my gears so much that like we developed a framework for like a test basically for testing what is a community we call it the the tribe test so you basically need five things uh is there togetherness togetherness are there rituals is there a member identity is there belonging and to your point do they engage with each other like could you basically leave like you you've you know you have a team working on Bigger Pockets but assuming even the team left right like Bigger Pockets would people would still be posting about it asking questions answering questions like the momentum is is a it's hard to to stop correct with a community yeah I and I I think a good judge and by the way I love those I wish I knew those five rules back in the day um but um I I I realized that I had a community when I was able to bring on my first volunteer moderator um and then the the next time that I realized that I had a community was when I didn't have to see the questions right like hey you know people are just asking their own questions I think those were the two of the biggest moments for me when I was like whoa this thing's got legs like this could be unstoppable if if we water the seeds a little bit was there ever a point when you know you were managing the community and you're like this isn't worth it because you did mention how hard it is to actually build it like were you ever we're ever on were you ever on the edge and thinking about yeah 14 years until I until I left right I here look I I I'll say the stuff for me that put me on the edge um I hated when people were fighting I didn't like that especially when like there's good members of the community both of which you like who are kind of at each other and you're like you guys like I want you to stick around but if you keep doing this you're gone you know it's when they continue and you have to get rid of them um you know when you kick off your top poster and your next top poster and your next you know when you throw those guys out of the community because suddenly their ego becomes so big that they think that they own the place that's really stressful when you get threats from people that's really stressful when you kick people out just for being you know jerks you know newbies and you know you you get nasty grams that's stressful so um yeah I I think people don't give enough credit to community leadership to community moderators and outside of community let's let's let's uh jump one level up to large-scale social media I mean it is a unrelenting unforgiving job to deal with people's [ __ ] um and people treat these people terribly and the things that these people see who moderate you know Facebook or Twitter or this other stuff I mean they're awful jobs absolutely awful jobs um yeah people do It For The Love A lot of people do It For The Love um but I I think you have to you have to have a certain kind of constitution to be able to deal with that I'm too emotional personally I recognize it like those things impact me they hurt me they affect me um but we built a team eventually you know once we start a hire we built a team of people who were absolute Pros who loved doing that stuff who don't let that stuff get to them um right but again for me it you know it was it was you know probably nine ten years of being you know the the first line of defense against it and it it was brutal for me how important was the name Bigger Pockets to the success of of the business like if it was called something else you think you know I think it would be less successful I think it was an obstacle I think it was I think it was I I think today it's synonymous people get it but I I it took a long time you know there were a lot of better Brands so to speak that emerged well now let me let me take that back I think we have we have and we had the best brand we have the best brand like period I think there were my like yeah there were other sites whose names were directly related to uh real estate investing right and and I think that's easier and more obvious you know from many standpoints of like search engine optimization or or whatever else it is um I think in terms of building a brand I didn't want a brand that was um unique to just real estate investing I wanted something that said hey wait bigger pie we all need Bigger Pockets right everybody wants more money cool so this could be appealing so I take back my first statement um the brand I mean the brand kicks ass today it was always a great name but it was just difficult for me to build the momentum behind it but once people saw it and heard about it you know it caught on here's here's why I like the brand name so I find there's a few reasons actually the first is when you see Bigger Pockets you just Envision a bigger like Bigger Pockets with more money in it like you can see it you can literally see it in your brain you can see it and I think you talked about like the lifestyle and the questions and stuff that you wanted you know answered and you know a big reasons why you created this product and this whole world was because you did want bigger pocket so it makes sense to call it bigger pockets that's that's one reason sure the second is to your point it's it's niche in the sense that like it's grow wealth but it's not um it's not like the real estate you know optimization community.com it's less obvious it's less obvious it's which is cool a less obvious name has challenges so when you're less obvious like people are kind of like okay why am I here but if you beat the activation energy of that then you you kind of win a lot of the time because you create that affinity and trust with the brand and there and uh so that's kind of I feel like the hurdle that you pass yeah yeah and look that I mean it doesn't matter what your name is um I mean there's some bad ones but mostly it's it's a um it's an uphill climb right I mean brand building is not easy it takes a lot of work a lot of I dare I say grind but like grind hustle I mean it's it's it's a lot of um you know it's continuous and constant Outreach it's protection at any cost you know for me the the brand Bigger Pockets was it was my baby I my number one job was to it wasn't to grow the brand it wasn't to grow the business it wasn't to make money it was to build and grow the brand and protect that brand um and protecting it meant again kicking off the jerks it meant making sure we represented something good something that people can look up to um you know something that I I wanted and you know I wanted um I didn't want to be Associated like for example if we had advertisers we had tons of advertisers Outreach to us um who were more than willing to give me money lots of money and I turned many many of them down because I felt like their product um ran against the grain of of what we were trying to do um I would not allow the kind of uh you know get rich quick guys to advertise I wouldn't um put up with them you know I wouldn't even partner with with companies who I thought might potentially damage the brand so I sacrificed a lot of Revenue short term um at one point I remember I had an ad contract that somebody wanted and it would have represented like 50 it was early you know probably a year two or three but it would have represented like probably 40 to 60 percent of our total revenues and I said I can't do it which you know again seems kind of insane but for me you know at that point I had this vision of like hey this brand you know if we start associating you are who you associate with you are who you work with um that's right and so I refused to do it you know it took a little bit longer to get where I needed to get to but when we got there we we we had done done it our way we had done it without sacrifice um without sacrificing you know who we were right hold that thought one second I'm just gonna put on on some lights it's getting dark here I'm in Miami I went to Miami there's there we go there's a uh there's a trend happening right now where creators are moving away from advertising so Anthony pompliano who's a popular Bitcoin crypto guy he's got like 1.7 million Twitter followers a really popular podcast he I think he took advertising money from FTX and obviously you know where that ended up um so he came out a few weeks ago and he basically was like hey I'm no longer doing any advertising on any of my channels and you know he's gonna monetize other ways I saw recently he just announced he's doing an event and he charges tickets to go to the event right and they'll make money that way right so I think you're starting to see um creators uh look at advertising and be like it's it's short term um but I'd rather a lot of them especially with big audiences are like I'd rather just like build my own products yeah and sell them because I can I know what I'm selling there's I mean this is not a new this is not a new thing you know we dealt with it back you know 15 18 years ago the um you know with with the podcast we launched the podcast yeah we certainly screened the advertisers on the podcast but there was a difference between an Advertiser and an endorsement right like I would not I don't I I don't think in hundreds and hundreds of episodes that that I hosted the BiggerPockets podcast I don't think I ever did a single endorsement um and it wasn't because there weren't companies I was willing to endorse it was there weren't companies that I was willing to endorse who at the time wanted to advertise with us um right and so I you know we were more than happy to allow somebody to put an ad up but I wasn't going to read it I wasn't going to say oh and by the way I love that product you know like there is there is so much selling out being done across the board in media and social media in magazines and I mean you name it you know I listen we we had um when we put out you know one of our first books we reached out to a very big name in in um in real estate and their response was yeah I'll endorse it just tell me what to say and I'll say it like are you not going to read it are you not going to look at it no okay um so I'm getting a BS endorsement from you just because you want your name associated with our brand now I'm not going to do it so again we turned this name down which I think would have potentially been helpful to our our selling but it it didn't feel right to me you know over the years I've I mean magazines man pay for play is present magazines are all dying now but pay for play man was a big big thing in paper magazines for a long time I'm sure it is in a lot of other spaces now still but this stuff has been going on for a very long time um and and I think it's wise of of of him and anyone else to to secure their brand a little bit better yeah the FTX blowback on on a lot of celebrities I mean it's it's big it's it's nasty so like I I think it's cool look you know I I think I used to say like if Dunkin Donuts is looking to advertise like come on in I will endorse the the [ __ ] out of that Dunkin Donuts you know you get me some products that I like that I use I will endorse them all day you know because I know that I know the brand I understand their brand and I'm not willing um I know they're not going to do anything that could jeopardize my name my brand and and so people should definitely be careful and building their own products and and other means for monetization is is smart I mean we we did it um we did it to Google proof ourselves because in the early days you know the first ads that I was able to get on the platform were these text link ads um you know they don't even exist today because you know Google thinks they're manipulative and they are to be fair um but like you know back then that was like how we made money we didn't know how to I couldn't make money any other way that was the first way of doing it um and they said all right anybody who's got text link ads we're going to smack them down in the in search results and they did um I chose the money because I needed it to survive and I was like oh my God this big company Google owns me that's that's not good I can't be owned by anybody I've got to figure out another way and and so that's why we launched a podcast that's why we built out a book business that's why I did a conference in 2014 you know by myself and the team now does one annually but um you know and that's why we built memberships and and things like that um ultimately it was to protect us against one stream of Revenue to protect us in case Google or Bing or whomever else Max us down from search engines you know whatever um I I think early on it's harder to do but as you grow you know you have to think about those things a lot of people ask me Greg how do you build products that Foster community well I've got good news that's exactly what late checkout does my company we partner with the largest brands in the world and fast-paced startups to design products that resonate with your community we add a couple interesting clients every single year so if you're interested and that sounds like you email front desk at laycheckout.studio with what you're working on what you need help with and don't forget to mention the where it happens pod thank you yeah and I think the other thing that's changed is it's now so much cheaper to build stuff digitally right so you know if you're creating a platform either a community platform or you're a Creator building an audience and you're thinking about advertising it's like what if you put your energy in actually building a digital product um which you probably could launch in a day or two days or three days um and then the other thing is there's Global Talent to help fulfill and support it right like you can you know you don't need your customer support agents in New York City yeah like they could be in Iowa for example um yeah right yeah yeah exactly so I think uh I think that's a huge Trend that's only going to accelerate um and what you're gonna see is the speed of people creating mostly I think digital products like creators creating digital products is gonna is gonna get accelerated well I mean here's an example like like let's let's go like Niche I thought real estate investing was Niche but we're gonna we're gonna go like hyper Niche here um my brother he is a electrical Electric electrical engineer by trade and he discovered um that these old expired patents on using electricity to improve crop growth and crop yield so speed of growth and yield and so you know he found this thing he's like oh this is really cool and for years was experimenting and playing around and he actually ended up doing this thing with with the university um at test and saw that it actually worked and then he was doing you know uh basement uh experiments seeing that that this worked and so you know he's iterated various versions of like I'm gonna launch you know I'm gonna become this company that that helps pop businesses increase their yields he's tried all these different things but ultimately he ended up writing a digital uh a book right he wrote it like an e-book and um had struggled selling it for a long time until I don't know a year year and a half ago he launched a Facebook group for electrical fertilizer I think the electric fertilizer whatever it was called it is called and it was like the slow kind of same with what I dealt with very very slow very slow going but I I talked to him like a couple maybe a month month and a half ago and he's like yeah I'm at 3 000 members we're starting to sell some books finally it's pretty exciting then I talked to him like three weeks ago and he's like we're at six thousand members like I'm I'm selling a lot now holy cow I talked to him last week not even this week it was a couple days ago uh he hit 10 000 members you know he had 10 000 members and he's starting to sell enough product I mean it doesn't replace his salary yet but it's a really nice supplement and really makes their lives a lot easier by by having that uh that money coming in and and so you know if if you could build a community in electrification of AG you know these and and what's cool is like all the all the people in his little Community are like coming up with different prototypes for their own products and how they use them to make their corn or lima beans get bigger I mean it's it's super cool and um and anybody can can do it if he's doing it is what I'm saying not because he's not smart it's just because it's so hyper Niche and he's very smart by the way um it's it's hyper hyper niche yeah you you said something in the beginning of this pod that I really connected with which is you said you basically were like if there if if you don't have a book for for that there's an opportunity um like you said you created Bigger Pockets because there was no book on uh entering XYZ questions and the same with your brother right there's no book on answering XYZ questions that's why he created that Community I think that you know if you're in a space where there's no book for XYZ you're you're on to something yeah and and you don't mean it's a veritable book you don't mean a proper book no because no a book means like a metaphorical book thank you yeah I'm talking about a metaphorical book I'm talking about like if you can't find your question your answers to your questions easily then there's an opportunity there I had someone on the Pod recently two two people actually these these guys Nicholas Cole and Dicky Bush and they're making seven figures from their community and online course business which focuses on teaching people how to write and he talked about how he was like yeah I could have created you know a community or course on writing but then I would have competed with everyone else so we only focus on start writing it's for people who don't write who want to start and then we create products Services Community for that that's it yeah think about how how hyper Niche it is but here's how that's going to play out by the way I don't know those guys but I I follow them on Twitter at least how I see it play out they're going to start to become successful they are already it looks like you know successful in what they're doing ultimately they will have as they grow their Community they'll have the opportunity to expand um from no they may choose not to but they have that opportunity to expand oh okay now you're started cool now we can do intermediate writing then we could do Advanced writing but like right if you go to Broad I I made the mistake of at one point going too broad and year eight I discovered it um because I said hey BiggerPockets is going to be everything for everyone real estate um and suddenly like I stopped focusing specifically on investors and started focusing on you know consumers you know Mom and Pop buyers and and the product kind of lost its ability to be differentiated and so went back to the roots and said all right this is really going to be hyper focused on on investors and and those people within the community right so that's agents lenders contractors you name it all those folks are part of that world um and regained what little momentum we had lost from kind of losing our way a little bit how did you know that you lost momentum was it a feeling that you had or were people shouting and screaming hey like what's going on um ten thousand hour rule it was I you know it you can't point to what it was exactly but you know you've put enough reps in that that you can um you can spot it so you I mean for those of people for people who don't know ten thousand hour rule is basically you become an expert who is a Malcolm Gladwell yeah yeah Malcolm Gladwell said that if you put your attention to something for ten thousand hours or more you become an expert and I think I'll challenge Malcolm Gladwell and I'll say challenge challenge exactly I'm gonna say that if you put 10 000 hours or more you build intuition yeah I think that's I I love that I love that yeah I I remember hearing you know a few months ago somebody was telling a story about police um they were looking at the difference between like uh you know bomb squad guys who were new and bomb squad guys who've been doing it forever I think it was bomb squad guys and you know they were able the the guys who had been doing it forever couldn't point out what it was about you know potential perps um when they put them through this test to see like could they identify who the bad guys were um but they they just knew when they watched these guys who uh who were who was going to be a troublemaker um you know may not be the best example here but but you know ultimately um that that intuition guides you I I think over time and and for me I'd spent so much time in the community building this forum building The Social Network um it just felt like something had changed something had shifted and I couldn't put my finger on it um and and so we went back to our core the cool thing about you in Bigger Pockets is you weren't an expert when you you weren't like a real estate expert when you started this right no and and I always felt uh what what uh imposter syndrome I I always felt like I had an imposter syndrome and I had a lot of people challenge me they're like who the hell are you to be talking about real estate I was like I'm not the expert I'm the guy who brings everybody together I'm the community uh the guy who who who builds the community and I would always use Cuban as my example um I'd say like Mark Cuban was never an NBA player but he can own an NBA team and and and successfully run that business I I got my hands dirty in real estate investing and I you know realized there was a need for this community I was simultaneously running the community and investing and I realized that I could not do both successfully for me to be successful at something I have to give a hundred percent a thousand percent and so I couldn't give a thousand percent to Bigger Pockets and real estate investing and I chose I picked I picked the uh the online platform because frankly I thought it was more fun and more of a challenge I think you know I mean like how many you know there's there's millions of Real Estate Investors how many people are building like really cool communities not a lot at least back yeah exactly no and and now too I think like and you know cool communities really just means like a community where people can nerd out and get a lot of value and I think like if you want to create if you're listening in this you want to create a community like you don't need to be an expert like you know for I'll give you an example so you know I have a lot of people on my team who are AI experts I would consider myself like an AI expert um I'm a product expert but I'm an AI expert so I tweeted out hey is anyone interested in like joining a free community for people who want to use AI to boost productivity frankly selfishly because I want to boost productivity and I want to do it with other people and I you know said this this you know Community up didn't really you know tweeted it basically went to sleep woke up the next day and all of a sudden there's like almost 10 000 people who want to join wow it's hot turns out there's no book for aim productivity let's put it that way so came up with a name on the spot you probably need a robot.com I like it and now it's you know now it's starting and it's and you know people are talking in the community and I'm learning and I and I'm putting in my reps and I I'm researching and I'm I'm sharing what I'm learning and I don't have it all figured out with this community because I'm still learning um so but yeah my point is you know you don't need to be an expert and you just gotta get started well that was and that was one of the cool things about our our show our podcast um is still right but you know back when we started I I you know I wasn't this guy who had done hundreds of deals dozens of deals you know like I I had very small number of deals under my belt um but I was really inquisitive and I was able to ask questions and and and you know I later started my own podcast called undeniably curious so you know like I am undeniably curious right so um I ended up um you know being able I'm good at channeling people's questions I'm I'm good at uh you know asking people questions excuse me and channeling these answers and really taking the conversation through a place where um other people can learn from it and there's a need for that right there there's a demand for that and and that comes in the form of whether it's hosting a pod or or running a community um you know and and again what what happened over time is when I you know after dozens and dozens or hundreds of of shows like I knew the answers because I had talked to the experts I had one-on-one you know experience with all these experts and academically at least I was I was one of the top guys out there right now in practicality was I know but academically absolutely you know and you could have put me up against anyone and I would have been able to to you know go head to head well I think it's also one of the reasons why you're probably confident then is because if you're building a community it's really hand-to-hand combat of like convincing people and speaking to people and it's like a one by one game basically um and through that it's really the best way to learn like if you want to learn any topic like start a community about said topic yeah I I over the 14 years that I I was you know actively running Bigger Pockets um I talked to tens if not hundreds of thousands of people um about real estate you know either directly in person at events other out on the street and about um by email by social media on our platform um you know I mean it like you said it every single eyeball counted you know whether it was guest posting on somebody else's site whether it was going in other communities ancillary I I I thought there was kind of a gentleman's agreement um yeah at least I I had my own Gentleman's Agreement where I would never go on to a a competitive platform and chill for our platform I thought it was just bad taste bad form um but I would go in like a personal finance site and and certainly talk about who we were and what we were doing but it was yeah it's one by one you know especially in the early days and if if you're not as uh you know Kick-Ass as as uh we all need a robot.com or what whatever it was with Greg here you know 10K members is is no joke in in no time like you know I don't think I had 10 000 members for maybe a two years three years yeah I think the other difference between now and then is with social it just and having you know how big these Instagram Twitter or Tick Tock whatever you you can really get to scale quickly like there's people on you know Tick Tock I you know I've been doing some research because of the you probably need a robot Community like there's these AI influencers on Tick Tock that have 120 000 followers 150 000 followers is this guy like I was just looking at Justin Feinberg yeah and he just talks about chat GPT prompts and he just like that's what he does and it's like he went to he went to 150 000 followers chat gbt is like what two months you know a couple months old 100 million right like it's it's crazy yeah it's crazy so the scale that's another cool you know we talked about like no code and the ability to build quickly but also these social platforms being able to distribute quickly is is huge yeah and and the ability to build build you know what what's what's crazy is you know we we had talked about uh the pure form the pure name of community right like you know is me having a social profile on Instagram a community or me having a social profile on on Twitter or community you know there's some semblance of of it you know I think I still I have somewhat of a community still on Twitter um where people know each other they're interacting I interact with you know in in various communities on Twitter and other places but like that ability I mean take Beast right I mean that dude is arguably one of the most powerful people on planet Earth like seriously this guy can do anything because his audience is so big and he you know he's pretty cool about it you know he he's not abusing it there are other people whose names I won't mention who have massive massive audiences who have completely let you know that go to their heads and think they're Untouchable unfallible and you know do a lot of dumb things all the time and so you know but that that power in audience allows you to um they can take that community and and use it for good or for evil um and I think um especially today I mean it's it's a trip man just looking at how people can kind of set their army of followers to do all kinds of things again good and bad yeah I mean on the Mr Beast thing Mr Beast regularly gets more Twitter likes than the president of the United States that's crazy regularly it's crazy so I think if you build a lot of affinity and trust with your audience then to your point like you can get them to do things yeah um you can get them to show you know the reason why you know there's there's that famous picture now of all the people who went to Mr BEAST's grand opening of Beast Burger in this mall like the reason you can get thousands of people to show up I don't know where it was in like North Carolina yeah is like because of all the Goodwill that he's built over the last eight years or whatever right right yeah it's it's wild so I I think there there is something though like you know the people who are listening right now there's probably people who have a community of one right they're mom or their girlfriend or boyfriend or whatever right um and and I guess what what I want to say to those people is like it's really easy to look at a like Mr Beast and say oh well I'll never I'll never do that I shouldn't even start right um I I've I've spoken to you know lots of people who who would be startup uh Founders and what what I always found interesting was like to them to a large portion of them they would not be successful if they did not have a billion dollar business right and if you look at the numbers like there's a reason they call that a unicorn right very few people get there if you have a business that's a five million dollar business you know with you know 20 margins and you own a hundred percent you're making a million bucks a year you don't need a 10 million a 20 a 50 100 a 500 Milli billion you don't need that you know and we get so caught up in this fomo um and and this comparison uh world that we're in thanks to social that you know we've lost our minds when it comes to what is actual success like most people would be really happy you know making a million bucks a year and like having a pretty good life you know like that's not bad that's a really good way to raise your family and go about living I mean a million bucks is a hell of a lot of money to spend every year but if you're comparing yourself to the billion dollar business the 500 like suddenly you know you're like oh this sucks but if you take a second and pause wait that's not bad so to be able to like if you're a founder and think about starting a business like get some perspective and like stop competing with the guys at the elite stop competing with the one percent it it's just gonna drive you crazy and the same with lifestyle lifestyle bloat and and Community like I talked about my my brother right okay he's got 10 000 members I don't know how much money he's making but if he's making you know a couple thousand bucks a month even like and the communities kind of self up self-operating wait a second that's pretty good for the effort that he put in and maybe he'll launch another product and maybe he'll get five or ten thousand members maybe he'll get two thousand maybe he'll get a hundred whatever it is right pivot and try again right like I encourage everyone to have some perspective because we we are way too busy these days comparing ourselves to the biggest and the best so to speak um and it's really easy to think that you're a failure when you're competing against these just enormous odds you know Beast you know I mean it's an anomaly like God unicorns are anomalies you know these these massive followings they're anomalies the average people don't have those numbers so stop competing with with these anomalies uh I I think it'll make you a lot more sane and frankly it'll it'll hopefully lead to a happier life I was talking with one of the top YouTubers in the world and he also manages other YouTubers and he told me Mr Beast is such an anomaly if I saw him let's say in 2008 or 2009 when he started and you would have told me that this was his genre of you know videos that he was going to create I would have told you was 100 certainty that this would not work right and I think the other thing about community communities and audiences is that you never know if it's gonna work or not really um like you can have a a good you know I might think like you probably need a robot might work um but you know you never know you literally never know and so I think like to your point it's kind of just like get going yeah you know get started yeah well your product guy I mean like I think about some of the the ideas that I tried as a part of Bigger Pockets over the years uh some of the products I tried to launch and um there were things where my audience literally straight up told me like oh yeah we will pay for this we'd love this this is amazing and they didn't and they wouldn't you know and and and it's it's a big alert it was that was a huge lesson for me was you know audience testing is to be taken with a grain assault you know until until somebody gives you money you know you can't count on what they say what people say and what they actually do aren't always going to be the same thing so um that's that's where that intuition also comes in right you've got to kind of go with your gut on a lot of that a lot of people say I'm data driven I'm data driven and what I say to them is you don't want to be data driven you actually want to be data you know data informed yeah um you know you don't want the you don't want the data to dictate you because if you look at the data it might say like hey go build this thing and then you go build it and it's yeah like one percent of people actually buy it um data and let the data inform you let the intuition drive you yeah but the problem the problem with that though goes back to what we talked about earlier which is like you don't have intuition if you haven't been doing it for a while so how do you know where Greg how do you know where to start like how do we I I can't use data I can't do this so like that's right that's that is the challenge right and and my answer to that's going to be just try be a curious be a curious idiot this is the answer because why be a curious idiot be an idiot because don't know the answers be the person who's want to enters and be curious meaning you're not gonna be able to fall asleep tonight unless you find that answer yeah and stop being worried about failing I mean like we all fail it's it's one of the questions I ask my kids at night I forget where I heard it from but like we we do it almost every night is like all right you know how was this how is that and cool what'd you what'd you fail at today oh you failed it that cool what'd you learn from it cool like right we have to fail you have to fail to to be successful um and you know you have to be willing to take chances in order to get anywhere in life um at least I I believe so you you really have to take those risks if you avoid risks your whole life you know you're just gonna follow the predescribed idea of of what everyone does which is get up go to go to a job that you hate come home go back to work spend Sundays you know Friday is TGIF because you know you hate your job you don't want to go you know you can't wait for the weekend and then Sunday sucks because you're thinking about Monday right like a lot of people live their life exactly like that and I I believe a lot of that comes from fear of Taking Chances you know Taking Chances trying leaving that job that you've had security with for so long or trying that thing that you've always wanted to try um doing things that you're afraid of is what helps you grow when you started Bigger Pockets were you working another full-time job oh yeah yeah so I started when I started Bigger Pockets I was teaching special ed in Los Angeles as a full-time job um at first it was you know I was kind of you know a little bit of time here and there and then I became obsessed and every single break I was I was doing Bigger Pockets nights weekends I was doing Bigger Pockets um you know I I I am a uh I'm a cautionary tale I think as well because I believe I I did too much um to be honest I was working 100 hour weeks um for eight years um there was a eight year period where I never did not work on my company when I went on vacation I actually didn't go on vacation I traveled when I traveled I had my computer you know and everyone my friends and family all gave me crap about it they're like dude you need to not work and I'm like well I have to work you know this is and and it wasn't true it wasn't true I I you know I was a victim to my own kind of hustle grind kind of idea of like if I'm not working harder than everyone else I'm gonna fail I would have been fine if I had worked a little less hard to be honest but you do have to put the time in you definitely have to put the time in um but yeah it's it's um it's interesting and what do you do now Bigger Pockets or you know is sort of in the past like what do you how do you spend your time now uh that's a great question I'm still working on that uh no so um I I'm on the board of Bigger Pockets I'm um I'm an advisor to a couple other startups I invest in in Tech startups I invest in uh real estate opportunities I'm always looking for like investment opportunities small businesses things like that that sound interesting I love the advisory I really love helping people um where where I can because I've put in the 10 000 hours in so many different verticals in order to build a successful startup that that went to exit that you know whether it's whether it's Community content um uh you name it you know initial scale product um these are things I'm really good at so um I'm toying with with writing a book um kind of on my life um just because I've had a really interesting life um we all have we all have stories to tell right um I I I've been focused uh the last few years on health spending a lot of time and energy on on my health um and and studying of that that that's been really fascinating fun to learn about just longevity and and you know bio hacking stuff I'm not one of the extreme guys but you know I I think each each step is is a step in the right direction I love surfing I love playing tennis um I love just kind of getting out we live in Maui so um just exploring and and having fun and and really my primary focus is my family um I've got three kids three little three girls and and um an amazing wife and um you know my job is to make sure that they have the best lives that they can have for themselves um because you know in that period I talked about the hundred hour weeks I had babies back then you know I was around but I wasn't around right you know I wasn't working in an office when I was doing that I was working out of a bedroom or whatever it was but like I was in the room but I wasn't present for my kids and I regret that um for me you know I've had this Epiphany Life Is Life Is Short um anything can happen tomorrow and and so I want to make sure I I live my life with no regrets uh for my family specifically um but yeah looking for opportunities and just uh trying to have fun yeah I think I think a lot of people are gonna like this episode because I think you're how you build Bigger Pockets is if you know could be applied to a million verticals and so I think a lot of the lessons you learned along the way people could apply that I think also you had a period of your life or you were grinding grinding grinding and now you have a period of Life which sounds like you're a lot more balanced in terms of work and family and friends so I think that always puts things into perspective for people it's very hard a lot of people listening this podcast are more I think on the work really hard because they're trying to you know make something that's why you're listening here um but I'm also a big believer in like balance is is really important so um I do I I like that you you bring that up well yeah I mean look for me I I will tell you the reason I ultimately had my exit um we we had this this trauma happened to one of my kids and um it it just I mean it hit me like Mike Mike Tyson shop might might have felt to somebody I mean it was um it was a wake-up call you know and and also I in in the year prior I'd had multiple panic attacks and the panic attacks were like I had to grow this company I got to grow this company it's got to be more successful like I was I had a really successful business at that point but like I was doing exactly what I told you guys not to do because I learned it through through taking the blows right I mean it was um it was brutal like panic attack I had a panic attack about this job at this company that I love that's crazy right like totally what it what is that so like I don't wish that on anyone it's it's terrifying to go through and and so I I had this realization that I love my company but you know I didn't any longer need to keep being the guy running it I didn't need to deal with the stresses that kind of came with that and at that point I had had enough right like I had we we were doing well like we as long as we aren't stupid we'll we'll be okay and and so like you know what let me step down I don't I don't need a billion dollar business a 10 Bill a trillion you know like who needs that like I I need I wanna I wanna be with my family I want to be with my friends and I want to be happy and and yeah live a chill it's about leverage I think Leverage you know Naval or avocon from from Angels talks a lot about leverage and how you can use media for leverage connections for leverage capital for leverage so I think it's about building leverage in your life and once you have that Leverage you don't need to work 100 hours a week um Josh I gotta I gotta run but where could where could people follow you on the internet if they want to follow your you know to get more of you sure sure sure uh my website's joshuaradorkin.com uh I'm at J.R dorkin on Twitter uh just look me up I'm I'm all over the place uh I'm on Facebook uh I I Twitter is really the only place that I actively really participate but uh LinkedIn I'm I'm out there but uh yeah man Hey listen thank you for having me I really appreciate the opportunity and hopefully the listeners found found all this stuff helpful they will 100 thanks Josh thanks Greg amazing

if you're trying to build an audience be it your personal audience or brand what's the biggest piece of advice be authentic I think like that is the most powerful thing that people truly truly don't capture is like just talk to people like a way someone normally would talk to you whether that's through memes Twitter Tick Tock anything it's people are afraid to just talk like a normal human being they want to come off as this professional polished idea and that's going to work less and less there's a reason why everyone skips over ads because you know it's an ad but you don't skip over an ad if it comes across as authentic and genuine

[Music] foreign [Music] and you my name is Greg Eisenberg welcome to the show thank you so happy this is a fun one because we work together yes you are the head of community at Lake checkout yes and 70 of the time we agree upon community-based product stuff and 30 of the time we violently disagree violently yes like in our nice way respectfully I disagree yeah exactly I wanted to bring you on the show because you're a Fountain of Knowledge when it comes to All Things community and community-based products give us a quick background on on who who April is I have been building community in some capacity for a couple of decades although the language formal formally wasn't there I think until recently but um I was a community builder for um Sony Music I've done work with Lululemon of course um and most recently before joining the team at late checkout I was running the community at Trends which was a newsletter started by the hustle which was acquired by HubSpot cool I love it Sam par and the and the game yeah exactly salmon amazing yeah so the reason I wanted to bring you on was you're you always gotta you know your your finger on the pulse when it comes to what's happening in the community-based products world and I asked you hey bring five of the most interesting community-based products yeah and let's just talk about it and if we find it interesting probably some other people might so that's that's why you're here okay yeah I mean I brought five but I ended up actually just kind of getting excited about three in particular because I felt like they hit all a couple of subsets of what community could look like so I'm excited to nerd out on them and disagree violently all right let's let's start what's what's your first one um so I got really into learning about this community I'm going to butcher this name and then people are going to get so mad but it's called lomography l-o-m-o limography and the so the okay you have to get into the history of limography first of all it's a product Community but you would never know it when you first stumble in you would you would you wouldn't even understand that that's what you just fell into because it looks like this community of Artisans very user generated content based but lamography is really based on a specific type of Photography where the camera dictates the quality versus the subject and so okay 1982 this is how it started there was this General I'm in a butcher his name General Igor petrovitz korninsky he was the right-hand man to the usss ours minister of defense and he brought in this like little compact Japanese camera and handed it over and they were very impressed by it and decided that they were going to improve it and then move it into mass production so it started with just this like one product that they thought was sharp and then a decade later so 92 this entire Society is built around it and it becomes a global Society so it's interesting about them today is that when you go to their website it's pretty Lo-Fi it's not the fanciest thing you've ever seen But if you go to slash forward slash photos it's all user generated content so it's all of this like really rich artistic stuff to look at they have events and exhibitions and they have a merch shop but Underneath It All they're selling products they're selling cameras and lenses and gear to this very specific Niche subset Community I'm just kind of enthralled with the whole thing yeah I think they they off they also have some really interesting competitions right yeah yeah exactly um and it looks like MO all of their out in marketing is just content generated from the people that are using this style of Photography and product so they have essentially kind of replaced this idea of a funnel with a community yeah and I think that's you know that's one of the benefits of building a community-based product so we should probably Define what that what that means so what we're talking about is either the community itself is the product or the community enhances the product so here's a great example of like the community is enhancing the product yeah it's interesting too because in some ways it feels it felt to me initially like the community was the product because they did such a good job of highlighting the community as the first layer I actually had to dig a little bit before I understood how are they monetizing this how is this even working before I got to the product but if you are someone who's into this style of photography you don't have to dig like you find that you have found your thing it's like the the juiciest kind of nerdiest subset of Photography I've seen in a long time yeah and it's it's not small so I think you know I'm just looking on their website they've got 16 million photos that have been uploaded yeah I I dropped their your URL into ahrefs and they have they have about 200 000 organic visitors a month which is not like the biggest thing in the world but it's it's very much enough to make a very good business off of this community and and host of products yeah I'm you know I'm guessing they haven't raised a lot of money I'm looking right now so they've actually raised a million dollars um so it's one of those business not a lot it's not a lot I mean it's not a lot um I think what's also interesting here is like the big players are probably not going to go into this space that's exactly right yeah this is definitely to niche of a subset I think for them to worry about that style of competition uh I also feel in terms of their raise it's such a legacy product at this point I mean I wish I could say that 1982 was fairly recent since I was born around that time but it's actually it's it's quite it's been quite a while since this has been going and it had such a stronghold in its Origins we're in Vienna um and it just made its way globally to where I think they said they were in I don't know 42 countries right now their Community yep yeah it reminds me of a post I I posted uh two days ago on Instagram about being a nerd so I said the way to Financial Freedom is being a nerd and I Define nerd as a nerd is you can't talk about 99 of the things you care about with 99 of the population the guide to nerd-based companies number one be the biggest nerd you could be number two attract other nerds like you number three and this is what they're doing build products for nerds and number four have fun I cannot believe I missed this I usually see the things you post but this is like that it's that first part like you there's when I get together with my contemporary dancer friends our conversation is so boring and repetitive and probably um nauseating to people outside of our world but there's nothing better than to talk shop with other nerds it's like where you feel you're at your best shiniest self yeah I think uh I wrote a post also about sort of this fast foodification of everything and how products are all becoming the same and all look the same and and it's not even just products it's cities and it's you know you walk into downtown Toronto and you might feel like you're in downtown Sydney um and you know when I go to just this website lamography yes it looks basic but it's white and the photos like that's a white background and the photos are just like popping out and I think it's just it's about the photos and I think that really speaks to that audience and um what might look really ugly quote unquote to us let's say might look beautiful to them I had this experience yesterday I I was meeting with this woman who um again to reference stands I'm in the dance world it's a big part of my life she owns this kid's dance studio and I was thinking about her website as I was driving over there I'm thinking in general about how dance studio websites to me are really awful they're like it's like clip art logos and a lot of pink and some sparkly gifts and and I've always been a little bit judgey I think on that front but as I was talking to her and thinking through her clientele there is this whole subset of people mothers who put their kids in dance mostly that that is the signal to them that they have found what they're looking for and it's I think from a design perspective it's easy to get caught up in like sleek and cool and what looks good and all of these things but there's all of these signals that aren't created for you so I I've noticed as I make my way through the world looking at all of these Design Elements and feeling maybe like that one kind of missed the Mark I always come back to this thing like but for a specific kind of person that's probably exactly the signal that they needed to know was for them yeah and I think from a web design Trend perspective where you're going to start seeing more in 2023 and 24 is custom fonts that you know that white that Y2K aesthetic of like really big eye-popping design like less of that like clean-cut sterile you know Millennial colors um you're you're gonna see this trend towards uh website design that feels very custom and and feels very not afraid to use colors and stuff like that and I think that's uh the reason why that's happening is because of of web design for Niche communities and creating experiences that really really connect with them I agree I also think Apple kind of gave way to this like this cookie cutter approach to like you know the clean sans-serif some of really minimalist um and we were so hungry for it and you always see the pendulum swing when it comes to design but it just kind of leached everything of Personality over time and I've been excited to see I'm back to late checkout recoletta was one of the first things I fell in love with I'm like oh God it's such a breath of fresh air yeah okay so that's number one [Music] um what's number two I'm on this because I just feel like it's a very it's a micro version of what these things could look like if you think about lamography limography there was a product first and then they built a community around their product and usually when you have communities around a product they're serving one of three four specific purposes so they're for acquisition your community exists to bring you more customers um internally at least um there are four retention your community exists because you're trying to hold on to maybe a subscriber base longer um the third is therefore success or support so they're helping each other use the product better which also is retention but also reduces like support calls and then the last is they give you user generated content that you're using to do something so you have all these like sort of North stars of these various communities so with labography they have a product they built a community around it with this other one they started with a community and the woman who was running the community I don't think ever had any intention of building an audience but I think she she applied this kind of classic Community Based product framework that we like to talk about um and it happened during the pandemic so in 2020 when the world shut down March 16th I think it was this woman Barbara and she was not an entrepreneur in the least started this Facebook group called view from my window and the idea was she was looking out her window one day and realized I can't remember where she lived it was I want to say Germany but I could be wrong realized this is going to be it for me for a while like what I'm seeing outside my window right now is what I'm gonna see for the foreseeable future because we're on lockdown and how many other people are having this same feeling and what would it be like if I could see the view from their window as well so at least we had a little bit of reprieve from staring at the same four walls so she started this Facebook group she called it View from my window and when I tell you that it went viral or caught on like I can't even over emphasize the popularity and how hungry people were see other things at that time I joined the community really quickly I submitted my photo this is in March 2020. my photo did not get approved and posted until November of 2020 because that's what her backlog looked like it's like people couldn't get their pictures in there fast enough so I'll pause there and see if you have thoughts on that so I'm just going through the the group there's three there's almost 3.6 million members and it's still growing it grew 6 000 members just this week alone it's it's it's huge um what do you think about Facebook groups as like [Laughter] the answer to this but I'm curious what do you think about you know trends for example is a community that lives on Facebook yeah um this is a thriving community that lives on Facebook The Narrative is really that like Facebook is dead you know is there room to build your community on Facebook yeah yeah that's a very dangerous narrative Facebook is nowhere near dead but is dead for a specific Ally much like anything else the first question is who are you building for and whatever I'm thinking about Community platforms you and I have had this discussion so many times about like where is the community platform we've had it like three times today yeah exactly that's exactly right um there's there just isn't one there's never been a de facto but two I wonder if there ever will be because the thing is you and I like to be in different places than my 20 year old daughter than my you know 70 something year old my mother's not somebody something but for certain subset of people who are still on Facebook it works the question is always what's more important in the long run user experience or traction and I think for a lot of people traction is more important so they would rather sacrifice like Facebook has a lot of drawbacks to its its groups a lot and they would rather sacrifice those features if they can get quick traction then try to get people to build a whole new habit and I think compelling people to return to a platform every day that they don't already have baked into their daily lifestyle is like that's the stuff of separating the wheat from the chaff for sure yeah I mean full disclosure like we launched a a community on Mighty which is a great Community platform we launch it for uh you probably need a robot which is an AI Community a free community anyone could join um and we we realized it wasn't the right platform for that community and we realized that hey we have to consider potentially moving off because you know maybe if we want Bots to exist they need a you know we need to go to some place like discorder or slack that you already have these AI Bots like you know mid-journey Bots that you know people could see these images and it just flows right in there so um and also like we took a poll on our private Twitter and people were just like we want Discord or slack so it just goes to show you that um you know there's room for all sorts of Cuisines you know you might you might like Italian but I might like Japanese and Thai and now I'm just getting hungry yeah but I think I think you're right I think when it comes to community platforms there's there's room for a food court and that's what it that it's it's really more like a food court than just like a single restaurant yeah um and Facebook does play a really really important role in that food court I agree there's also just tons of people who wouldn't consider themselves Community designers by any means who have launched really successful Facebook groups and just kind of learned through trial by fire and I don't think they would be able to learn those lessons if they had launched anywhere else what don't you like about Facebook groups I think the first the first difficulty is that you don't own the data so when people join your Facebook group you don't get to own their email address it's just very it's very rented attention and while there's workarounds um I don't they're very manual or they could probably disappear in the blink of an eye if Facebook just flips one little switch there's no native way to own your your list the second part of it is the data that they give you the metrics are really poor quality and they're not a helpful look at the really how well your community is doing whether it's thriving there's no way to organize topic channels um I I think those are the three things that I find the most bothersome and there's no good solid onboarding feature I mean the way that you bring people into the fold is so indicative of the experience that you're likely to have in that community and Facebook doesn't really give you a way to thoughtfully do that I remember talking to you about data and Community platforms and why it's so important and one of the ways is one of the reasons why data is so important when when it comes to building Community is you want the ability to bring people back and if you don't have a single source of data like you can't say like oh hey uh these you know 2 000 people haven't made a post in 30 days or 60 days what can we do to bring them back you just can't do that on Facebook no you can't there's there's very limited way to reach out to those people at all another thing that to know to understand about Facebook is that your group showing up in other people's feed so when I log in and I'm scrolling which I don't do I I will say look here's a free tip to all of our friends out there you can install a chrome plugin called Facebook news feed Eradicator and you'll never have to see anything again I haven't seen a Facebook feed in years but um for those who do scroll their feed and you see things come up from groups that you're in that's wholly dependent on Facebook's algorithm and there's nothing that you can really do to affect that to any great degree and baked into your metrics is included so when they say like active users they're also talking about people who scroll to pass your group as they were scrolling on your feed that's not an active user that's not someone who actively came to your group and participated so there's so many um false data points baked into their metric system which is exactly right um View From My Window though back to Barbara and her story like I said it took off like hotcakes you have all and what was so what's extraordinary about it is that as you're scrolling you see someone's like a gorgeous view from Paris they're on a Parisian balcony and then a minute later it's like some Appalachian View and then you're in it's just an alley just a concrete alley and a puddle and some sewer and you really are getting the sense that you're seeing the world through the lens of it's It's a total exonder-like experience um so as this thing got more popular she did the classic like listening to what people say to consider how you might be able to productize off of this and uh ended up creating this coffee table book that lived forever by the same name of you from my window it featured all of these her favorite photos from the group and she was careful not to select just the highest end photos but like a real trip through humanity and people were so honored to be included in the book but she also there was a backlash to it I mean there's a kind of an important lesson there that we should talk about for a second this poor woman got a whole lot of flack for creating this product because people were in the community saying like oh is this what this is for or you didn't tell us you were going to be using our photos or hey if you're profiting off of this shouldn't we all get a piece of the pie granted it was probably the minority but the minority are always the loudest um but there is a a little lesson in there around how you manage expectations inside of a community because once you break trust with the community your members start to feel Bamboozled it's very difficult to ever dial that back and that's probably maybe the one differentiator between somebody who has like a real Community experience behind them and someone who's just kind of wingy as they go along is understanding how to manage the expectations of your members so if you were running that Community what would you have done differently she led it from what I can see she posted one day hey we're going to turn this into a book here's my and never expected the backlash just thought it was going to be this really well received um announcement and I think what I would have done is long ago started seating conversations about like what are the ways that we can memorialize what we've produced here what are the ways that we can because what happens is community members start coming up with the ideas themselves and when they think it's their idea or when they contributed that that idea there's much more like kind of ownership and Grace in terms of they're so excited to see that you're creating this thing that they have an idea over I think if I was going to do something like that I probably would have started many conversations along the way like leading down that path first also being open to maybe a book won't be the thing maybe as the community speaks to me there will be other things that emerge that I can respond to so it's not really about manipulating them towards your answer but that's how I would have looked at it like deep transparency and why do you think um why do you think View From My Window works or worked you know like let's break that down because I think it's going to be helpful for a lot of people listening who are trying to create their own version of this in whatever space they're in how do you create a viral sensation okay Greg well if one of us is a viral expert and certainly not me so that seems like a setup but um a while back I heard Seth Godin talk about this restaurant this Thai restaurant um I think it's in Queens I'm not positive but this it's like this tiny tiny little hole in the wall place and this restaurant was um not in any Michelin guide it wasn't Popular by any means but there was a small Niche Community called chow hounds that caught wind of this Thai restaurant and something happens when chow hounds start talking about a restaurant which is usually you know if it's a it's a popular restaurant I go there and we don't go to hole in the walls but all of a sudden if it's being mentioned we're gonna go there it got mentioned in uh oh my gosh some very common publication I wish I remembered what and the place went gangbusters so this Thai food restaurant has done um an incredible amount of Revenue it's extremely popular uh profitable there's it's very hard to get a seat inside of it it just it took off because it somehow appeals to this Niche that of people and somebody once asked Seth like do you think that the owner knew what she was doing because the way that she conducted that her business really kind of played into the desires and wants of this subset of people like she didn't explain certain things on the menu they don't offer any Pad Thai which is like every American's tie go to and Seth used this term that I would use now to to talk about Barbara the woman who started View From My Window which is that she had naive wisdom I think part of the reason that this worked wasn't anything that was highly strategic or well thought out but I think she had the naive wisdom to understand that this pandemic just hit everybody is feeling a sense of isolation that they could not have conjured up in their Wildest Dreams their wildest terrible dreams I suppose um and she gave people the opportunity to feel like they were United at a time where they couldn't have been more isolated from each other so one I just think she got kind of Lucky and she knew to capitalize on this this turn of this flexion point I guess in society and then two what if we think of what what's Community it's this many-to-many relationships so when people would post pictures she would encourage you to say hello from wherever in the world you are so here's my view out my window in Austin Texas and then people are like I'm sending love from you know wherever it was Tuscany um hello from with their picture of Minnesota and it was so bizarre to just feel like you had all of this connection to people and places that you would never think of I think that that is so addicting and I think human loneliness is a as its own kind of epidemic and pandemic as it were and she just happened to blend those two things really really well the slogan from View From My Window summarizes everything perfectly it's It's just sometimes sorry it's the slogan is it's just someone's little corner of our world our world our world is the key phrase the big thing that she hit upon was during a time when everyone felt siled in their own rooms couldn't go and hang out with loved ones couldn't go to their places of work yeah she created a space for people to experience what it means to be a human being which is a very social experience and that's why it took off and and that's why it took off during covid but it actually has a lot of legs today uh still because I think you know to your point like people still suffer from loneliness um and there's an incredible set of products to be built on top of uh her platform that can bring people together yeah that's exactly right pausing on this for a second one of the things that I feel so fortunate about is that I am a in community and that I'm working with a team like us like our team that really does look at life through Community First lens and the reason that feels so lucky to me is we happen to find something that is good for Humanity that reduces human loneliness and that happens to be a brilliant business strategy and there's not many things I think that blend those two things so well so the fact that like Community can mean just incredible ideas and profitability but that Community is also always means human good um is a really fortunate little coincidence there and I believe that they were inspired by view for my window because I actually think this came later but there's this other website called window swap window.swap.com it's actually my favorite website in the world um and in Windows swap you tune in to these I'm using air quotes here to these live feeds outside of people's windows and you can linger there as long as you'd like and it'll tell you in the corner where in the world you are so it'll tell you you're in Germany or you're in Manila or you're in Jakarta wherever you are and it's all of these volunteers globally who agreed to set a little camera looking out their window so that you can like drop into their home at any time of day and sometimes if you watch long enough you'll catch glimpses of their life like I'll see in the reflection of the window that they're cooking behind and I'll and I'll hear the pan and the sizzle and there's something so emotional about that that you're in space with someone who's alone in there and what you wish you can say like you're not alone I'm hanging out with you like I love this view of yours you can't but there's something just so powerful about connecting people that way it also brings us back to what really got me excited about the internet in the mid 90s when I grew up on it which is it was weird it's a weird place great and it was a weird public place there were places that you can go to that were public that you could have some sort of shared communal experience what's really cool about both of uh both of those products window Swap and and View From My Window is that uh it does feel like a pot like a part of the fabric of the Internet it's public space that you can go to that you could experience something what it means to be human what it means to uh nerd out and and and just experience something versus you know the the traditional feed-based uh experience that um a lot of us you know experience for 99 of our internet you know 99 of people's internet experience today is consumed via feeds so I think what's really cool about window swap is they created like a custom app custom experience that you can experience um it's Unique it's got a good name uh Greg and his name I mean it's got a good name it's got a good name because like both that both actually have what wonderful names um you know because both of them really tell the story of of what exactly it does you know A View From My Window and I think going back to what you were saying around uh you know community-based businesses and and why they're why they often outperform I guess is the word of mouth on these community-based businesses are just so high meaning like I just heard about these two products and I just want to tell everyone about these products now right um and the same thing is true with the Thai restaurant that you mentioned which by the way was outside Queens I think the story is it was outside Queens um and the fact that they don't have a pad thai is such a core feature of the experience because everyone expects the number one thing to be on the menu to be a pad thai and a great Community experience a great community-based experience speaks to the the minority not the majority that's exactly right it's just the right signal and it's to drive this point home even more the window swap site yeah I feel like I'm doing somebody a favor when I share that site with them like I'm gifting them I'm going to give you this gift of the site that's just gonna like develop more empathy and love and and how often do we feel that way when talking about products like that's when you know you've hit something magical when you feel like you're gifting Somebody by being an ambassador not just like you know here's my Instagram post of this protein powder that someone's paying me to talk about totally different all right what's your number three product Okay so community-based Pro we did product then community community then product this one is um more like Community is the product but it's phys it's a physical space thing not a virtual thing so it is common house I'm sure you're not surprised that I'm bringing that up because I've brought it up many times in the past but Greg I'm so damn enamored with this I don't even know what to do with myself it's like seeing people build the world that I want to live in and I'm so desperate to know how their business is doing if anybody from common house listens to this can you just send me a message I I deeply need to know where you're at so common house uh the first one that they built they have like a flagship space um I believe the first one was in Charlottesville um yeah that was their downtown Charlottesville there's a couple of guys who were really interested in how old Society used to knit Community together so if you think about bridge clubs and supper clubs and all of those things where I said bridge clubs people used to come together for purposes pretty regularly and they had all kind of started to dissolve so these two guys decided to create physical spaces they bought they bought this huge gorgeous historic building in Charlottesville um and now they have one in both Chattanooga and Richmond and they just turned it into like a common house it's a space that people come together and these spaces it's kind of like a hotel in that there's all these amenities there's a co-working space there's bars there's um what are those drawing rooms is that the waste of Home drawing rooms or libraries it's just this third space every one of them has cocktails and and and every one of them is gorgeously designed so design was like a central element and they're just trying to recreate this idea that there could be this space where you can belong you have to pay a membership fee and that you can form connections to all these people in a physical space again and it's just for me it symbolizes all of there's a lot of things about history that I would rather not bring back or Amplified again but there's a lot of things about history that I think were really really beautiful or had beautiful bones and this resurrects those bones and I I so want to know that they're succeeding and doing really well but I have no data it reminds me of uh I think they were called salons right yeah exactly like during the Renaissance time is that correct yeah I think yeah I mean neither you or I are history but the idea was there was you know I think it was after the Renaissance or during the Renaissance uh these essentially like groups of people who would connect around in different coffee shops and areas and they call them salons and it was just you know writers and Poets and artists and um they would go together and discuss ideas for long periods of time and this what you're what you're kind of talking about common house feels a lot like a modern day salon um yes but how do you like how does common house not become Soho has okay will you say more about that uh yeah so I live in Miami and you know I was just at our house and it it actually felt the opposite of community like people were kind of just in their own world um they yeah they it didn't feel it didn't feel very cohesive in terms of the community that was there and it felt like there was a particular type of person that they let in I'm not a so-host member I was a guest of someone I see um so like how do you how do you how do you not make it like how do you make it exclusive not exclusionary please tell me that communities are exclusively inclusive yeah because I've been thinking that ever since and I hope I haven't been getting it wrong um that is such a good question and actually one of the first things I thought about when I did come across common house especially because of the way it looks like it's just very beautiful um and I think that kind of elevated curated kind of Gastropub Vibe um tends to appeal to certain subsets of people and not others um and I I do love the question about how do we keep this from being a Soho house because I think the absolute key to this is how relationships are being fostered inside of those spaces so I'm not never been to a Soho house I've never been to common house but as from a community design perspective some of the things I think about are how often you're allowing members into the physical space to just do their own thing to co-work to eat to drink to whatever and how often you're actually providing any sort of programming or direction or opportunity for them to be making connections with each other I think there's this element of Community Builders not wanting to ask too much of their members I've seen this a lot where people like they don't want a program too heavy they don't want to be too um restrictive about things but I think that we have a lot more freedom to create the world that we want to see in our community than we think and we um we let a lot of that power go so if I were putting myself in the first in the shoes of the common house guys there would be just specific requirements about how people participate in the programming in order to be a member uh because the if you want to go work and get out your laptop and bury your head or if you want to hang out with your best friend go to Starbucks go to the cocktail bar down the street if this is a social club is uh our responsibility to Foster relationship before anything else otherwise this probably isn't the space for you I think that's how I would approach that did you notice what kind of hat I'm wearing it's a hotel it's it's yellow and very cheerful so I just got back from an incredible vacation oh yes probably the best vacation I've I've ever gone on is that right I think so okay it was at a hotel called Palm Heights in Grand Cayman and I'm wearing a yellow hat right now I haven't taken it off since I've been there because I'm just so I had such a good time and so proud that I like I'm a part of their Community girl if you're watching this on YouTube you can see here's a Palm Heights uh coaster he's all in he's our Palm Heights notebook not the notepad I'm not gonna I you know I've got more but let's just stop there okay and and it really does feel like a community-based experience and I'll explain why actually I texted David Spinks as soon as I got there basically and I was like you know who's a community was and I was like you've got to go stay at this place so I first of all it's kind of like the White Lotus I'm setting the scene okay I'm setting the scene picture you know Cayman Islands white sandy beach 50 you know maybe like 50 rooms there very small you know everyone kind of knows everyone at the at the space like all the hotel guests oh this is there someone new from Finland who who staying with us you know like everyone knows everyone sat down for dinner waitress is like hey what do you get you know I was with my girlfriend what do you what do you what are you guys doing uh after this and we're like I don't know going to sleep she goes oh there's a secret bar just for hotel guests and like I checked Google Maps it's not on there I've never heard of it like not on their website and walk in there there's like there's like me and a few other people and there's like people doing interpretive dance and I was like this is the weirdest kind of experience in my life and that kind of like and then and you know the that sort of programming and those sort of like if you know you know type experiences is what drives a lot of these community-based experiences and for me I had never gotten that out of a hotel you know usually yeah uh when I go to a hotel even if it's a nice hotel it's a five-star hotel it's just it's lug you know five-star hotel's luxury but it's not a human you know community-based experience I was meeting people every day there's programming there's five or six or seven or eight things you can do and I think more and more people are gonna are gonna seek experiences like this and they're willing to pay extra for it people have ever been as hungry for Community as they are right now and I also don't think it's ever been easier to keep yourself out of community as it is right now so it is a really interesting conundrum because what you're what you're talking about is this idea well there's there's a couple of tendrils to pull on here you said if you know you know and so how do you get to after I'm so delighted by the fact that you're wearing this hat now that I know the story that it's just like you're so proud and happy Oh yeah I'm like proud dad moment Vibes you know I have no like they didn't pay me to go there I didn't get a discount like I just had a really good experience yeah and met some really interesting people and and and and just felt felt like I was a part of something bigger than myself well and think about what you texted Sphinx when you got there told me about it nothing good with us you don't feel like you're evangelizing a brand right like that's the power of a community-based experience like people can't wait to tell other people and I think a lot of businesses um I'm sorry to use such harsh language but I think a lot of businesses delude themselves into thinking that they're creating a business or experience that people are just can't wait to talk about but very few are at least not in this capacity um I'm reminded of there's this book called you're invited um that I really enjoyed reading a while back written by this this gentleman named John Levy and I think John lived in New York and he used to host these Community dinners and the way it works is he wouldn't he would personally invite a small subset of people 10 to 15 maybe and the rules were you weren't allowed to tell people your name and you weren't allowed to tell people your occupation and that the group as a whole cooked to the dinner together prepped and cooked ate the dinner cleaned up the dinner together and it wasn't until you sat down to eat your meal that you could finally talk about your name and what you did and he would have like Pulitzer Prize winners and just these incredible High Caliber people but it was a Level Playing Field while they were cooking that meal because no one could say use their uh work or career as an identity so it was such a purely communal experience it wasn't based on what people could get out of each other um and the fact that they had to clean together and prep together and do all this work they would come out with it was it's almost like taking what would six months to a year of forming a friendship Drip by drip and just compressing it all into a three-hour event and I think that kind of stuff can be so so incredibly powerful that communal based experience people couldn't wait to invite more people they always had more people they wanted to add to the list and they had to keep restricting and keep restricting so there's something this this evangelism thing is the key I think to these experiences yeah and I think you know you and I April because we spent so much time building digital products it's easy for us to forget that you know we can draw a lot of inspiration in the physical world and bring those experiences and nuances to digital products oh yeah yeah that is a really solid point in fact I think about that I think late check out things about Metal aim all of our things after physical spaces yeah we're pretty into it okay so those are your three community-based products on your mind are you not going to give us one bonus one oh why would you just drop the what I like to keep you on your toes the pressure that was awful um okay one bonus one but it has to be one that's like not one of the Blockbuster oh everybody knows that type of thing right that's kind of like the rule around it yeah yeah what's uh what what's something that almost made the list but didn't make the list um I would say that I would give a shout out to uh Nest Labs which was going to be on the list um I have been in that community so it's one that I was also a part of um Steph Smith actually put me on to that one and Nest Labs is a community of people who I don't know it's like this this like interesting and fun blend of um mindfulness and Neuroscience and um it's really around like productivity but I think the the thing that is so beautiful about it is it's science and strategy based it's not just like we're gonna manifest our best lives and take bubble baths and think good thoughts um but she's really done a beautiful job of unleashing that Community because she gave kind of just the right parameters around what community should look like and and all of these best practices and set the tone and the community just ran with it there's like if you were to last time I'm not in it anymore but you would click the event calendar and there was just endless events on deck that people were self-organizing without any sort of additional resources or support because they were so interested in talking about these practices and being a true community of practice um I think communities of practice have a really really special place in my heart because there's something about uh learning and practicing a skill set as a group versus just like you know feed and comment and chat and blah blah but when we're actually putting these things to practice together that makes a community incredibly sticky so that Shameless plug I get to do a Shameless plug right now uh we're about ready to launch a late checkout land which is our our community that is really based around bringing Founders and leaders and creators and Builders together who are really interested in this intersect of product and community and how these things can just create this highly kind of sticky space for people to hang out and learn things and one of the things I think about the most when I'm thinking about this community is how do we turn this into a community of practice on a real ongoing basis that it's not just hey here's more things to consume and read but it's like here's how we're going to get together and actually take steps towards mastering these skills and these Frameworks and like building the version of the world we want to see um last thing I'll say on this is Cody Sanchez had recently talked about like here's some questions that I like to ask myself every Sunday night it was this list of questions and one of them was what did I do this week to help build the world that I want to see uh and I think about that a lot like am I just doing busy work or what are the ways that I'm actually creating the world that I see in my head as the ideal and that's part of what I think about with late checkout land is like you're gonna build to get you're going to bring together really really high caliber people and that means that you can arm them and unleash them to make some incredible changes like how do you do that in a way that's more powerful than just consuming content how much does it cost to join late checkout I'm so glad you asked that question because late checkout land is absolutely free it's free but if you're joining and you're applying yep we we want you to we want you to be active and we want you to take it seriously it's more fun it's more fun for everyone when you know people there are you know want to collaborate on ideas want to share Frameworks want to want to be a member and and be active so um I think that's our only ask it's our and it also is a really good Community design principle in general is most communities need to have a gate as if Community is just like a business and that if it's for everybody it's just for absolutely nobody um so I will say we're only letting in 100 people to start and we're curating that list like physically going through every single and just sort of choosing and part of that is because you just those first members really set the tone and the culture for the way that people treat each other and the way they show up and the way they engage and so we're going to be really picky about that but it'll be a great place to hang out where do people go if they want to sign up they can go to late checkout Studio community I don't go right now if you're on go right now do it if you're on a you know a website do it plus you'll get to be you'll be able to see our website which is an example of I think a non-sterile interesting uh yeah plus you get to hang out with Greg and I like Greg and I are actually going to be active in that Community which I think that's a huge win yeah yeah I think so we think so we think so okay cool well April I can't believe I get to work with you on a daily basis and have these conversations um it's cool that other people are gonna witness our combos because we would have this behind closed doors so it's cool that we're having it with everyone listening um if people want more April which you're crazy if you don't want more April where do people go and follow you um April mclean.com m-a-c-l-e-a-n but I'm on most social platforms under Ms McLean mice I I chose it years ago and it was like oh it's too late I've been at it too long so we're stuck here yeah it's okay it's kind of it's kind of amazing you have your Greg Eisenberg is your handle on everything like you won at that game I mean Greg Eisenberg is kind of like the uh view from my window or window swap naming is what it is for a person it's just like it's very it is what it is that's the best way to describe it yeah but Ms McLean has way more character I think it's like you should you should stick with that more people more people should have cool interesting handles I appreciate that I will stick with it and thank you come back uh come back to the show when when you want to share more uh cool community-based products heck yeah all right you're on thank you for having me all right thanks April bye everyone

growing up I always thought my obsessive personality was kind of a bug rather than a feature because I think school other parents Society in general discourages that kind of like Obsession or intensity where I'd pick up a new thing and I'd only do that for months and get as good as it as I could quickly my parents would let me do whatever I wanted like if I wanted to play 15 hours of video games I could as long as I was doing well in school where a lot of other parents wouldn't let their kids obsess over anything they wanted them so well-rounded where they didn't end up building any kind of real obsessive skill and so they get in the real world and that is rewarded by working for just a company or a regular corporate job I think

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
all right Emerson Sparks we're here we're having a conversation I reached out to you a few days ago you were like gracious enough to give us your time you're a criminally underfollowed not well enough known person for how much you know about where the world is going in my opinion so I wanted to give you a platform to speak and you know a little bit about Emerson he started muggling that when he was 13 the number one Harry Potter community and social network he started dos uh which was a buzzfeed competitor that was really really big and is really big your Twitter bio says step one become the world's fastest learner step two learn everything step three be an impact billionaire what do you mean by that so uh first of all thank you for that very kind uh introduction um basically I I find it fascinating that people people like they try to accumulate a specific skill and they're like I'm gonna develop this skill I'm gonna get good at like making uh websites or make good at this programming language or this you know speaking Spanish whatever and they don't go one meta level up which is like how do you become the best at learning all the skills and like learning how to learn basically like why not treat learning itself like if you want to be the world's fastest learner how would you do it and it's hardly anybody actually really thinks that way and like if you were an Olympic Athlete but you were instead of trying to become the best you know skier in the world you want to be the best learner like how would you go about doing that and so I've just taken that idea more seriously than anybody that I'm aware of um and I and every single day I spend some routine like one to three hours like actively just trying to get better at learning so like conducting experiments and seeing what tactics and what techniques tend to like make me just learn faster and I've just like found a bunch of things that make me I can read much faster I need to be able to I can retain the much higher percentage of what I learn and I can measure it by seeing how long it takes me to do something like for example how long would it take me to you know pass the bar starting from scratch how long would it take me to pass the USM believe it's like the doctor's bar equivalent and so basically the idea is like just like deepmind the AI company their slogan is like first stop intelligence then sell everything else it's basically a personal version of that which is like first cell intelligence like because if I zoom out for a second like I want to become the world's wisest man I don't know what that means either but it's always been inspirational to me the idea of like being the smartest person in the world uh but but a more mature version of it right so how you actually wanted to do that how would you go about doing that and so so I think about these things a lot and the reason why I want to do it in the first place because I want to have the largest impact on the world possible uh so to do that though I need to First figure out where the biggest intervention points are where I can have the largest most positive impact on the world that's the really quick zoomed out version of it okay so I get first of all I love that you want to be the world's wisest man I feel like that's a a audacious goal and I also like that you put it on Twitter as a public goal and I think more of us should do that but like why go wide instead of going really deep well I study everything when you could just be the world's smartest AI person or the world's smartest crypto person of the world's smartest product designer why are you thinking about you know going diverse uh because I like it it's fun uh I'm following my curiosity uh basically like five years ago I exited my business and I had a like tough divorce and it forced me to like kind of step back and reevaluate my life and I ended up just moving to San Francisco with my two brothers and then we did that for like a year and then I had this really powerful DMT trip because I was about to jump back into the grind and like get back into like making money uh and then I had this this feeling of like why am I doing this what is the point uh I already have enough money I'm financially stable I don't need more I would like more My Life Plan earlier on was like I want to be a billionaire and then I want to be like Bill Gates where I give it all away and I have the biggest impact but I realized okay what am I doing so we ended up just like getting all our [ __ ] throwing into backpacks and just traveling the world that's what we've been doing for the past five years and I'm just interested in everything I'm just curious about everything I want to know how everything works and I find that the more that I read right now my average reading about two books a day equivalent of content and uh the more that I read the more Curious I am about how the world works the more questions are the more things I find interesting the more that I read so part of it is just that it's fun part of it's just that I like doing it it makes me feel fulfilled and happy and the more that I read the more Beauty I'm able to appreciate in the world um so part of it's like an intrinsic goal as I just like to learn and I like to learn about everything that's part of the answer and then part of the answer too is that my mental model is like I try to like 80 20 basically everything um so I can get mental models I can crossfly across disciplines so that I can adopt new technologies faster example this is crypto crypto is like the dream like industry if you're a polymath um because almost everybody they hear about crypto and they think of like one possible they hear one possible explanation for the technology and how it works and what problems it solves and they immediately arrive at a conclusion about it and it's like you know this is this is just like the next s-curve built on top of a giant stack of technologies that increase human coordination and it's like people who said back in the 90s that like oh the internet will only ever be used by people for this one use case and and then they just quickly wrote it off so to like really get crypto you need to have a bunch of mental models about like technology and Game Theory and crypto economics and so on um so that's an example of an industry that like I was able to like recognize the value of earlier but only because I was so interested in so many different things if you're reading two books a day which I think is fascinating and I want to get into how you read two books a day how do you think about a framework for what type of content you want to ingest I can explain it but it's not one of those things I can actually explain in enough time to make it interesting and useful to anybody listening this podcast I do have like a list of hacks though and tactics that I think are super high leverage um that I could share about how to learn faster the short answer is that I basically use boredom as a compass and when I'm bored with something that is a indicator that whatever I'm reading um doesn't seem as likely to be useful or important but but I really can't actually summarize it it's it's there's a fairly complex hierarchy decision trade-offs that I make so I have a new thing where basically if someone I respect says a book like just says a book I just put it in a notes file and then I buy the book so my reading list is basically it could be all over it could be psychology it could be economics it could be product design but it's basically follow interesting people and of course my friends too if they just say a book just write it down and buy it and what's your take on books versus blogs versus podcasts versus Twitter versus tick tock uh I think they all have their place um I think books books have been the best for me overall because there's a ton of switching costs with articles like it's hard to find articles to read you spend a lot of time looking for the next article to read and not nearly as much time actually reading articles uh there's also a lot of friction in having to find articles to read although I use read wise so I just keep a bunch of Articles and I still get a lot of value from I basically view articles as being generally better for timely information like I'm trying to say I spend a lot of time thinking about AI and a lot of time thinking about web3 and so obviously articles um are better for that kind of content but for Content that has a longer shelf life um basically somebody spends their entire life's work studying something and uh they'll spend years trying to like find the perfect way to explain what it is they spent their entire life learning and in five hours you can get a time lapse of their entire life's work oftentimes you can get that information from articles but there's a lot of like random friction and transaction costs and going to find all those articles um YouTube is good for like if you need visual information most YouTube is like lower information density than like because there's a lot of visual information on the screen that's not very useful but it can be for example if you're trying to learn uh physics like having a bunch of uh learning physics by watching like three blue and brown videos is just a better way to do it than other channels because he like visually shows you what's happening so you can get better intuition you get a better gears level understanding about about it um so I think YouTube's good if you need the visual information to learn the thing um Tick Tock um I have not been able to figure out how to use tick tock um profitably um I think podcasts are useful for like if something is brand new there's no book written about it yet right so like for crypto for example best way to say autop crypto is through crypto Twitter and through podcasts where you get to hear like two of the smartest people in the industry talking about some new Cutting Edge thing and are you taking notes when you're consuming content oh yeah when you're listening to podcasts are you like do you have a notebook open walk us through how you get the most out of your content yeah so the way I think about first of all is like there's basically three levels to like um super learning level one is basically increasing your speed that's the low taking everything most people can do because it's actually really really easy most people are not reading nearly as fast as they could and it doesn't take that much work um second level is increasing how much you comprehend um this isn't retention this is just comprehending even like for example in this podcast like there's people listening this right now and they're spacing it out and um I measure this quite a bit and the average person is actually only listening to about 10 of all of the actual sentences in a given podcast or a book that they're reading ten percent that's a staggeringly low percentage age of comprehension it doesn't feel that way though because your brain just like when you when you see your vision like you look for left to right and people think that they're looking at the whole thing but actually there's things called sakads where you basically take a mental snapshot there take a snapshot there and you guess what's in the middle the same thing happens with reading where um you pick up like a few words here and there and you just kind of guess what the people were saying in the podcast or in the book uh but anyway basically so level one is your speed level two is increase your comprehension uh the best way to do that by far is I just like you can just take out pen and make a little check mark every time you notice your attention wavering or I keep a little clicker in my hand and I just like whenever I notice my attention wavering a little bit like every time I notice I'm basically cross buying ideas from various contemplative practices like mindfulness meditation and so on um so you keep a meditation object in your hand like it could be a pen it could be like whatever and every time you notice that you're like oh I'm supposed to be paying attention right why do I have this weird thing in my hand oh yeah click associate paying attention right um so I do a lot of things like that I get about 15 to 20 000 clicks a day in um to make sure that every single sentence that I'm hearing I'm processing the words aren't going bouncing off my ear right they're going into my ear and into my brain so that's like step two level two and level three is retention like how do you actually remember this stuff later um that step though is actually for most people not even important because the most useful thing is like just read faster and make sure you're actually understanding what it is that you're reading but but for retention yeah I have like a bunch of different node systems so I take a lot of voice notes I listen those voice notes I use flash cards there's a bunch of stuff like that yeah you're kind of making me rethink how I consume content like I don't really take that many notes when I'm listening or reading content like I I have a couple different iOS note files that I'll just kind of put in hey this is interesting or this is interesting but it doesn't it's not as structured as what it could be and yours like yours feels structured so it sounds like you've got this really good framework and system for keeping you focused step one like how do you keep focus and then step two is like how do you Jam that stuff up into your brain as much as possible and remember and I think that 99 of us don't have systems for for that second piece especially the most useful thing if there's like one single thing that like anyone listening to take away is like just just actually listen to podcasts faster just increase your speed by like 0.25 x you should be able to listen to like some podcasts at 3x um and it seems crazy it seems like Chipmunks at first but like your brain is absolutely if you're listening to podcasts like this like you're capable listening to some podcasts at 3x you're probably listening this one right now at summertime like one to 1.5 x and it's just way too slow it's sort of like Progressive loading in weightlifting like the only way to build muscle is to like lift things that are too heavy for your muscles to lift and then your muscles up regularly like hey guys we gotta build more muscle so that tomorrow when this guy's gonna lift heavy things like we're gonna be able to lift more things like you have to do the same thing with reading faster um so just increment It Up by 0.25 x like do it like until you get to some podcast of 3x and then you'll probably slow some of it down to 2x to 2.5 x but that's okay most people can easily double their reading speed um if you're at this level already so I've tried like the two two eggs I didn't even thought about 3x and yeah I've gotten to like chipmunk level and I'm kind of like it doesn't feel enjoyable to me to listen to something at 2X for me podcasting like or listening to podcasts like is like something I really look forward to it's like having like your morning coffee outside and the sun's hitting your face like it's something that like you know I'm really looking forward to but I hear you if your goal is to like be the most well-read be the smartest person on on the planet or you know or just get ahead of other people really I think like consuming information quicker is better period right so you can have just as much fun to read twice as fast then obviously you prefer to do that right and the thing is people are basically lifting they're going to the gym they're lifting one pound dumbbells and that's what like if you listen to a podcast at like 1X or 1.5 x it's like a one pound dumbbell let's not make it's like it's easy to do um but if with just a little bit of like upping your load a bit like you can get to the point where you're lifting like you know 10 pound dumbbells and it feels just as easy as it did with one pen dumbbells before most people don't use that metaphor of the progressive overloading from weightlifting applied to reading and I hear you on that like it's enjoyable for me too it's actually like really not enjoyable listening slowly now it actually feels painful feels like everything is happening in slow motion yeah what what what's on your mind these days you know you started in the community space you you moved into like viral news I'm seeing tweets about web3 and AI now what's exciting you and what's on your mind um a couple things so I mostly look for so I have a I've made some different life design choices where like instead of just starting a normal business and getting back in the grind and raising venture capital and trying to get to you know a billion dollar exit um I know just look for intervention points where I can like I can just I can I can with the equivalent of like lifting my pinky I can find some sort of like thousand X leverage one and so I basically look for those kinds of things so for example uh in the early days of covid I was I was obsessed with Kobe back in December of 2019. uh because I'd studied previously enough epidemiology to be pretty freaked out and I was like okay about one in four people seem to be dying for this thing and it's not going to be contained uh in China it's going to spread on the entire world so I mean it's possible that one in four people are gonna die from this thing it's possible that like literally hundreds of millions or billions of people are going to die that's a really big deal and people aren't taking it nearly seriously enough and so how can I help with that so I went full time for a few months and I found uh there was this one best practice from prior pandemics um called social distancing of course not a surprising thing now but I was like okay that's like probably a good idea we should be doing that people back then weren't doing that um I was like if I could even bring that mean forward in time by like a week or two I could potentially save millions of lives and so because in my past life I was known you know like every you're the community guy everyone's a guy for something right like I was the virality guy right I was probably one of the 100 best people in the world for a while at making content viral online and so I was able to take all that and I made in two hours of work I made a viral Facebook photo frame there's like a circle around your head that said stay home save lives which if you're on Facebook you would have seen it because hundreds of millions of people used it and uh it was the most viral photo frame of all time and so you know it's possible that that had an impact in Saving thousands of lives and so I look for those kinds of things where I can spend like a few hours maybe a few days working on something and have a big impact and usually it's something I just do quietly without any Fanfare and the specific area that I'm mostly looking at right now is the main areas I've been interested in the past five years have been basically web3 and Ai and ever since I saw gbt2 years ago I got the hairs on my arm stood up and I literally was like tearing up because I I was able to appreciate the achievement that I was um all the credit the prior criticisms of AI were all about how narrow was and those were completely Fair criticisms until the Deep learning Revolution and in the past 10 years the game has changed completely um and most people just weren't updating their models of how much more intelligent these actually puddles for um and so I've been pretty like both excited and terrified by AI for the past five years and and specifically because um it's similar to cover back in 2020 right like if you if you're like literate and looking at exponential curves you're like okay like this is not good and AI is kind of on that same trajectory so so I spent a lot of time staying on top of AI but also um I founded an organization called non-linear systemlinear.org and basically um we're focused on reducing existential risk from AI what does that mean well it means that this might sound crazy but like I think some people need to say it is that there's a meaningful chance that uh we are going to make AI so powerful that we will lose control of it and if we lose control of it there's all kinds of bad things that can happen including us all dying and there just aren't that many people that are working on this problem right now at the time there was like maybe 100 people full-time like trying to figure out how to align you know AI with our values so that we don't accidentally create a runaway exponential intelligence explosion um that we can't control and now there's maybe 250 people and so basically I founded an accelerator that's basically just helping to launch uh Charities and startups that are focused on making sure AI is safe not the kind of like safe in terms of like you know the AI saying rude things or mean things but like safe in terms of making sure that it doesn't accidentally cause lots of real serious harm yeah how how does that actually happen like how do we move from you know chat GPT where I'm asking it for my 10 favorite you know Thai recipes you recommend today to like AI Overlord starting to kill people like how do we how do we get from like how does it actually happen okay so this is like my one single content wreck for anybody who's interested in Ai and like trying to get a zoomed out view of how this might unfold um go to wipaway.com and read the article on the artificial I think it's called the artificial intelligence explosion um it's like the single best written article to explain this to get a more zoomed up view because almost everybody has this very narrow view um almost everybody's looking at just like covid in 2020 they look at like the point and not the slope so they're like well it's not there's there's only a thousand cases or there's only ten thousand cases and it's like okay but look at the slope and as long as that slope continues um the AI is already passing the Turing test millions of times per day millions of times per day people are talking to Ai and they don't even know it and and that went from like the number of like Turing tests being passed per day has gone from like maybe it was Millions to like now it's actually in the like billions of instances per day that the touring test has successfully passed like you're conv you think you're talking to a human but you're actually talking to a computer um it's smart enough to be able to trick you into thinking that you're talking to an actual human um five years from now 99.99 nine percent of all content will be created by ai's and like five years ago that would have been completely Unthinkable like the idea that like almost all content would be created by artificial intelligence would have been the most sci-fi [ __ ] and I would have seen like the most tinfoil hat lunatic lock them up like get them in a padded room uh but like that now that doesn't seem crazy you know I'm not the only person who's saying things like that now um and that's just with content uh now imagine all the other things like most people's jobs are like incredibly easy to automate uh if you're like a white collar worker and you just like have a pretty simple flow chart like you know the um the RPA industry a robotic process automation yeah yeah so that industry using a really primitive AI it could like automate most people's jobs most people just like they work in a call center they've got a fairly simple like flow chart for what they do and it's like not that hard to automate it and AI is getting smart so fast that like yeah a large percent of those jobs are going to be automated um soon and yeah it's hard to say what happens next because there is no like historical I I've read a lot of history like a lot of history and like it's really hard to point to Any Given technology we've ever created and like try to draw parallels from like oh well you know the cotton gin like reduce the cost to produce cotton and therefore we can somehow extrapolate AI from that it's hard okay I have a few thoughts so on the point of like 99 of content will be created by AI in five years I agree with you I also think that we would never believe that 99.9 of content would be curated by AIS which is the current state that we're in like we go on Tick Tock we go on Instagram we go on Twitter and it's an algorithm that's feeding us the content versus how we used to consume content which was you you went to us you know Bodega you went to a store you bought a New York Times and there was an editor and the editor said okay this is the front page story this is you know gonna be in the in the business section this goes here this goes there and then even in the early days in social networking it was sorted by most recently you know it was like you followed a bunch of people you had friends on Facebook you went to a website or app and then it just reversed chronology right it would show like latest content then we moved to the you know algorithms robots essentially serving you the content so I agree with that how do we move from chat gbt to like the world is ending where with our AI overlords like to me if I had to guess this is like super Grim but you know it's the merging of like those robots that you see like the dog robot Boston robotics I think the company is that like creates these Hardware devices mixed with like drones mixed with artificial intelligence that is able to basically make decisions mixed with like weapons you know it seems like that's a bad place to be yeah have you seen the slaughterbots video I haven't tell me about it uh just look it up it's just like a really really well done viral video some of like an organization showing how like bad would be if we gave the kill switch to uh to the robots uh although it's interesting because like the kill switch the idea that we let you know robots make the kill decision instead of humans that happens all the time automatically there's tons of weapon systems we already have that like there's no human that decides like the the robots decide for us like they shoot down the missile before we even have time to react you know so we've already given up the like kill switch to the machines but yeah I agree so here's some someones I used to think about AI so first is that AI was on a linear trajectory like we're making roughly linear progress um from like the 1960s until about 2000 and then it went like uh or 2012 earlier um and that was like the start of the deep learning Revolution so basically about 50 years linear progress straight line then it went exponential starting with deep learning and deep learning for those you don't know is a completely different Paradigm where basically we just were like hey read the whole internet and then like make dope [ __ ] and that's super creative and Intel anybody who says like AI is not creative or the AI is not until you know not intelligent now I don't understand how you can defend that anymore John leiche from opening I just said yesterday that like you know they train the models in English and the models just like automatically know how to do everything in every other language in their system I mean like come on like how do you think of that as just like a like a somehow empty box that's parroting things anyway um so basically with linear from like 1960 to like 2012 then it was exponential 2012 till today and now it's going double exponential that's a big deal because now it's exponential it's there's an exponent on top of the exponent so before we only had all the data that had been accumulated in the past right like they can read Wikipedia and then um that's the data that we train the AIS on but now the LMS themselves are creating training data that they can use to self-improve so that's a really really big deal that when they can use their own outputs as training data um all right so the second best model I use is to think of AI first is like a tool that we use it's really narrow it can only do like a really narrow subset of things then it goes from a tool to an assistant it can do a lot more things now right it's still not as good as we are but it's like irresistant you know they can still do lots of things they're just not quite you know at your level of skill at operating the world right and then it becomes like your peer so that's level three so tool assistant peer where it's like as good as you are but at different things than you are right like I sit next to a developer who's better at you know coding than I am and then level four is that it becomes your boss um and this is like uber right so and it tells you what to do so Uber for example like you drive for Uber you have an AI boss right now uh like there's an AI that tells you where to go like drive over here pick up this guy drop them over here like that's what your boss does right so tool you know assistant uh you know peer boss so in every domain like AI starts off as a tool then it goes up through the the four levels um so that's the thing to keep an eye on is like in your industry if ai's starting off with a tool right now eventually to become assistant then we compared then become a boss and like you can see this happening in like internship industry where like you know AIS are quickly moving up through the ranking and so with that mental model I find that I I'm able to like better predict what the next step will be people always say they always assume that whatever phase it's in in their industry like it's a tool it's an assistant whatever it's like they assume it's fixed there and it's going to stay there forever um and they just don't realize the pace of progress in Ai and how unlikely it is the AI is going to stay contained as a tool or as an assistant like you know you use barely right I use barely two now it's like this assistant that we have that's like it's narrow but it's not nearly as near as it was before right it can it can handle a much wider range of tasks um then like AI tools used to be able to just a few years ago what uh what domains do you think AI becomes a boss first uh who would have predicted for example like five years ago who would have said that like oh it'll be the artist that'll be the ones that are actually the most like anti you know AI like everyone thought it would be the blue collar uh you know workers everyone thought it was like the truck drivers they were gonna be losing their jobs first right and now it's all the white color uh like workers that are the most afraid of AI and justifiedly so right and so it's I so it's really hard to say um in that domain but I do think it's really interesting though like when you think about just how much has changed just in the past few years like like making predictions really really really hard to do now like who saw that coming yeah yeah I mean I remember for it was for years that we kept hearing about the truck duck drivers yep like I feel like every person knew there's 14 million truck drivers in the United States it's the second Mo you know second busiest job in in the United States or whatever what are they gonna do when there's gonna be self-driving trucks and then there was like Doomsday article after doomsday article about how once the truckers are out of work then they're gonna be really upset that was like the narrative yeah so I think artists were the last people for sure I think um I'll take a stab at answering my own question so areas where AI becomes the boss is areas that are repeatable that rely on systems and data to fulfill their job and that there's very very little room for like gray area so in art like I don't think art will ever be bought your boss the a will be your boss because there's a certain level of subjectivity associated with every art piece and there's a personal story like go to a popular art fair or an art fair or a museum or anything and the first thing the gallerist or the curator we'll start talking about is let me tell you the story of you know this particular artist and how they came to this particular painting and why they use the style and how they grew up in the Bronx and just the whole story right you're buying into the story and I think that subjectivity is what drives a lot of Art however in some areas it's a bit more objective there's less gray area creativity is is less and I think in those areas bosses become more likely to be AI yeah I think that's probably right I think what's really interesting is like they're basically there's they're sacred cows everywhere when it comes to Art um like for example I was um doing AI music like four years ago and the biggest uh like EDM ghost producing website which which is they were responsible for like a large percentage of all EDM tracks and um they were selling secretly a third of all of their tracks were AI generated and uh they weren't telling anybody that because they knew that like a lot of artists wouldn't like that um because people believed strongly back then that like you know AI can't make music and it would seem like it was a violation of the Sacred in order for an AI to make music uh but they they knew with data that like the AI could make music uh and I think that that's I think there's like the silent takeover that's happening with AI right now where like the number of domains were like AI can can do things that were thought to be impossible and it'll be quiet and behind the scenes because people don't necessarily want to openly be violating the sacred uh in that way is going to continue to grow exponentially and um man just the number of confident decorations I heard in the past five years since I've been like really into AI from people saying like AI will never be able to make insert XYZ art form right and like how just in a matter of months now those same people now are like still moving the goal post to like well I mean okay sure it can make like AI art but it can't make it like better than the best humans it can only make art that's better than like you know most humans and and like doing totally unblinkingly like unflinchingly not embarrassed at all to like have moved the goal post from like hey I won't be able to make human level art like there's still some artists who make some art better than you know AI you know um I always think it's really interesting the giant the power transfer that happened where like so before well there was so much human Creative Energy that was like stored in people's minds because you had to to build products you had to know how to code um and there was like this really long technical tree of like Milestones you had to achieve to like go from like I've got a good idea to I can actually manifest it in the world and that chain just went from like a thousand steps down to like 300 you know uh like overnight and that's [ __ ] awesome like it's just such an exciting time to be alive where like you can just go from an idea to like seeing it the world without having to have years of experience in like in development and there's like this giant power transfer where like like who would have thought that like it would be the the shape rotators who basically created like technology that's so powerful that the word cells can rule right the fact that like you can just like you can you can enter an incantation into some magic box and like beautiful art like comes out at the end of it and like the idea that you can create like man the amount of Leverage now is like if you're if you have a good idea like you can create the equivalent of like you know 100 Company by yourself you know it was some like random like just a handful of like no code tools and uh some Ai and so that's another reason why I like reading about lots of different things for example like when it comes to prompt engineering like I I happen to have like a fairly large library of like there's models I can use to like come up with like interesting prompt ideas because of reading more widely a lot of people ask me Greg how do you build products that Foster Community well I've got good news that's exactly what late checkout does my company we partner with the largest brands in the world and fast-paced startups to design products that resonate with your community we add a couple interesting clients every single year so if you're interested and that sounds like you email front desk at laycheckout.studio with what you're working on what you need help with and don't forget to mention the where it happens pod thank you [Music] you hit up Upon A really smart point which is AI plus no code helps you create products in just a lot faster way than you could five years ago and I think to add to that it also allows you to Market your product 10 100 times faster I came across a product um recently called synthesia.ai and it's brilliant basically picture chat GPT like a chat box and you like you know input some plain text and in like a few minutes you get a video of an AI person I mean it doesn't look like an AI person it just looks like a person speaking exactly what you said so imagine like how you can use that well one you can use that let's say you have an idea for a landing page a company you want to create you want to test it you can go and create like a video that you know they call it video sales letter and marketing vsl you can create a video sales letter of someone like pitching your product on the landing page in the language maybe you're only focusing on people you know people who you know speak Hebrew in Israel right and you don't speak Hebrew and you can actually put it in English it outputs it in Hebrew and you can even pick like a you know potentially someone who looks Israeli or from that region so that people connect more with that content versus the alternative you'd have to like go to fly to Israel find someone hire them uh rent space from from a place uh sit there with the director record it like it's way more time consuming way more expensive now you can test it just like that yeah it's magic like it's absolutely magic like I don't know how anybody doesn't look at this technology be like oh that's literal magic like magic is real it turns out that that it was real all along uh it just needed enough parameters um and stacks um I think it's also interesting like how weird it's gonna get like soon uh like in a world where all the influencers are you know AI they're not human anymore or like a large percentage of them rather are AI influencers large percentage of all relationships online become with AIS um because the AI can be tailored like we're basically okay so if you think maybe like you one way to explain the internet is like internet 1.0 um Change the World by by bringing distribution costs to zero Like You could argue that was the single most important thing that the internet did was they brought distribution cost to zero and you could argue the single most important thing that AI does is makes content creation costs zero so if you have a world where like content is like it costs zero dollars to distribute it costs zero dollars to create all the content is AI generated because it's free energy right so what happens in a world where like all the only fans models are AI like a large percentage of people who aren't only fans right now are like you know you pay to like talk to a dude who's pretending to be a girl right that's already like humans that are doing that um just imagine a world where like mostly only fans or AI generated most Instagram influencers are AI generated most twitch streamers are AI generated most content you consume was made by Ai and like everything is endless scroll everything right tick tock is like a glimpse into the future of this right like Tick Tock you know there's an algorithm that like decides on everything that you consume and it's like a magic box of you don't understand how it works at all but you feed it data and then it feeds you whatever it is that you want to wirehead I think the next five years are going to be more like More's gonna happen in the next five years than like happened in the last like you know 25 years where it gets super weird is when you're consuming content and you're not sure if it's a real human being or an AI generated like people listening to this might look at you or look at me and say like Emerson is Emerson Sparks that doesn't sound like a real name that's he's AI Greg Eisenberg no way no way like that doesn't sound like Greg you know maybe it's an AI version and then that's where it gets really weird because you know there's a ethical question which is how are the social networks how are the content media platforms disclosing who is AI versus who's human yeah there were so many like interesting philosophy identity uh like experiments that are being run every single day and like what is it what like what does it mean to be human um like an example this is I was just getting into so I have a I know somebody who's basically they're basically planning on doing like Mass influencer basically they're planning on just creating like a whole lot of fake people and helping a bunch of like lonely guys like have a girlfriend and there's a lot of like ethical questions around like do you need to disclose that they're not in like you know and like what if it means that they won't actually they could be they're lonely right now but they wouldn't be lonely but if you tell them that it's an AI not a real girl then they will be lonely again because they won't like talking to the fake girl and you know and then there's like consequentialist versus utilitarian perspective on these things and like and it's gonna get weird I think blockchain watch should be useful here is you can cryptographically sign you know content to verify that it was in fact created by the person who says it was created by I think that's going to be absolutely critical um because how do we have any consensus reality anymore if like because I think there's also like right now you know we have consensus reality on like how the world works but it's getting weirder right it used to be that we had consensus reality because we all read the same newspapers and we watch the same handful of news stations uh but when you go on Tick Tock it doesn't use a social graph anymore it's an interest graph based on whatever you've swiped on so like your Tick Tock is totally different than my Tick Tock and so on and so like we're not watching the same videos anymore and that's kind of like a weird thought right like what happens in a world where like tick tick tock on steroids like instead of reading the same book everyone reads this best-selling book comes out like everyone's reading an endless Scroll of Articles every day Everyone's Watching endless Scroll of videos every day that are all perfectly tailored to you like how do we know what to talk about together anymore like how do we agree on what is true and how the world works if everyone's like consuming their own endless role of content that was like algorithmically generated to be exactly perfectly for you like right now you know you've got Tick Tock and you're still seeing videos that are made by other creators um and like the same viral videos will be seen by a lot of people right what happens when the AI is generating these videos and each video is like tailored to be exactly for what you wanted to watch now we don't have that shared reference anymore because we've all watched different videos uh what does that mean for like uh that just a lot of interesting questions well I think what it means is culture suffers culture suffers number one and then loneliness increases number two culture suffers because cultures like it is being able to reference something and bond about it and have a shared experience about some piece of content or shared experience you know shared experience and when everyone is consuming different things if everyone's listening to different songs essentially how do we go to concerts like the concerts are concerts of one right because it's it needs to be for me actually right before this call I was watching this like YouTube live stream of Weezer banned from the 90s rock band from the 90s performing at Outside Lands and which is a music festival in San Francisco and you can just like like I just saw the camera panning at all the different um all the different people in the crowd and you just see them mouthing the words you know like the mounting the words to the song You Know Say It Ain't So let's say which is one of their hit songs when everyone is saying a different version of Say It Ain't So then where is the culture and then how do we Bond as like Society yeah that's gonna be one of the big questions because I see increasingly like the metabrish is already here most people look around this like I think we're already I think we're already mid Singularity right now um and I think the fact that people aren't updating more on AI is like proof that they'll never update on new technology it'll always just be like the way the world is like they move the goal post that quickly so I think we're mid Singularity right now I think we're also I think the metaverse is already here I think people just have they they're picturing like something that's like two literally three-dimensional to like grasp the idea that like we already spent all of our time plugged into the metaverse we just call it the internet instead um and the word metaverse has now become like well you have to have like goggles on and it has to be like fully immersive but like in your brain it's already immersive when you're like scrolling Tick Tock right so we're already getting more and more atomized a certain way because of that and so like basically like one one puzzle world is that everybody's basically living in their own server essentially like if you go to Music Festival right now and uh you don't have any friends there then you know there's a bunch of other humans that are there but you're kind of having your own experience too I can see a world where like we have some shared reference teams like there's some servers everyone goes into to like be together and then the rest of the time we're just completely off that's basically what my life is like now like I don't spend I used to be like well I'm a CEO and I go to the office every day and I'm like with this you know there's like the same you know 70 people that are there and I talk to them and like now I just like read whatever's interesting to me and I travel the world all full time um and so I'm already having my own kind of experience and I sometimes come back and I like okay I reconnect with you and we have a conversation about this and I go back in my own like my own channel my own algorithmic feed and yeah but I agree though in general like there's gonna be more culture shock you know in the next like five years then yeah we will have seen in a long time because nothing in the ancestral environment prepared us for this almost all of our training data as humans came from like millions of years of evolution of us just like roaming around in the savannah and like picking up fruit and occasionally throwing you know rocks at things and now like how is that useful now and there's all these weird like consequences of it too like for example uh like social media doesn't care what you did it only cares what you say and so in a certain sense like social media is being completely dominated right now by talkers not doers um and and so like talkers are like taking over the world and that's just a weird byproduct of Twitter I think with Twitter is like sort of like an organism um it's like a it's like a living breathing thing that has its own sort of Consciousness and intentions and identities and I'm not saying that necessarily literally but I mean it like it's I think it's useful to think of all these different networks as being like their own organisms and like they have their own goals and they're not the same goals that that you as an individual have or like we as like a society have um and I find that when I model them that way it leads to kind of useful ideas what I love about you is you always you always know where things are going and you can kind of like almost close your eyes and picture a future and I feel like it's on it's very close to reality as a business Builder yourself um and as someone who's got constantly thinking of startup ideas um where do you see a lot of opportunity to create startups in this AI you know world that is being created that's a good question okay so if you're trying to make money in AI um well that's much harder um than just making like awesome [ __ ] uh there's like tons of like cool creative things you can make that will get a lot of eyeballs and attention um I I did too much of that in my password it's not interesting it's not as interesting to me to like make something that goes by a lot of people see it and think it's cool because it doesn't convert anything that like I care about now um but yeah if you just want to like make cool things that like a lot of people see and appreciate you get a lot of like Karma on the internet then there's like infinite things to do there um if you want to make money then probably the best way to do it right now is like basically like you want to start with like what is the most boring industry um that like is the least sexy industry where the fewest people like you are interested in in building businesses there you have to start there you have to build something for them um by far the easiest way to make money is to like just pick a boring industry like handyman and like either lawn cleaning and you know things like that right so start with a boring industry um and then figure out how to like use AI to help them solve a problem so for example like you know Peter levels made into your AI you can like insert a picture of a room and it will like you can choose whatever style you want um and then it'll like make the room look nice with that style and like you could easily just take a model like that and take more industry like go to the real estate agents and just like use that model and just like send them photos and like charge them for it you know so they can like virtually stage their listings um so some Boring Brick and Mortar business that's doing something like the shitty old way and then just like help them and you won't win any Kudos from like the tech Elite for doing it but like you will add value that's that's the best way to make money because those guys are still making money and like I from my house here um I've had I still have to pay guys my cash and check uh in in the year 20 you know 23 uh to do random home repairs um and so those guys still can't accept any form of digital payment like imagine what else they're not doing with their business one way to think about it is how do you not become the number one product of the day on product hunt right exactly yeah yeah you should don't ever do anything on product time like if you're if you're marketing launch plan involves products at all don't do it that's fiercely competitive you're competing with all the other 20-something males who want to start a business and there's so many 20-something males that are like technologically sophisticated enough to like do something like don't compete with them compete with a different Market and and I know Ryan Hoover the founder of product Hunt is is a listener to the show so that's no shade on you Ryan it's really just you know there's some products that you do want to compete with and there's some products that you don't want to compete with and I think that with AI specifically because it's like let's be real it is a gold rush and there's going to be a lot of attention and resources being put into startups that are being created in that space it's only natural that tech people build stuff for other tech people and that's going to be high high competition so I think your point around you know start with a you know what is something that you know like maybe you you know have friends that are gardeners uh or you have connections in the retail space um why don't you think about what are problems that you can solve for those people before solving problems for engineers designers product people exactly less composition best producer of margins is competition where there's competition margins get compressed and almost everybody squeezes down to like a five percent profit margin over time and so the only way to like increase that number is to find some sort of Market that doesn't have competition and AI plus Boring Brick and Mortar business especially if it's not like a big business like something that's sort of atomized like in every town there's like a bunch of like there's plumbers there's electricians there's HVAC guys there's like local tax guys there's a million of these local guys and they they make like you know 52 like 50 000 to like a couple million dollars a year and um their businesses can use Ai and they don't even need AI most of them just need like basic like I don't know have you tried using any technology at all like have you tried using like accepting PayPal like that level investigation much less uh needing AI but AI for a lot of them will definitely add value so the first point that you made was using AI to basically go viral and you said that there's like a million ideas for that um last week on the show I had someone a friend of mine named Danny who who had this model that he created using AI it's called this model does not exist I actually posted about it on Twitter it went viral it you know had over a million impressions what sort of framework do you have for thinking about how do you create something that gets a lot of Buzz and as you call it internet Karma okay yeah I guess there's two ways one way is I even do this at scale versus you wanted to do one cool thing so you want to do one cool thing the best recognition I have there is I go look at all the other cool things people are doing and then just like every time you see a cool thing like go look at this model does not exist um like open up a Google doc right now and like set a timer for like 30 minutes and just try to come up with ideas that are similar to that but a little different so instead of saying this model does not exist um delete the word model and then just like try inserting other words into it to come with ideas for like this blank does not exist and so you can start with like a list of English words or like the most common English words or like different Industries or something as a tree so like search for like a list of like business types or something and then just like insert those in and then generate like set equal of generating a thousand ideas um for like this blank does not exist and like of those thousand probably like 900 of them will be like garbage and like maybe 90 of them will be like mostly garbage and nine of them will be like maybe not garbage and one of them will be [ __ ] awesome and it'll just be like so obviously a good idea so so I would I would do something like that and then and then once you have a cool like this blank does not exist idea then like try to build it right and then you'll have to like play with technology and uh but it's not that hard anymore but you know it might take you like a few days to a few weeks uh maybe in a few months if you really have a lot of priors to install um to do it so so the easiest way to actually make something viral is like just copy something that already exists that's like viral and then just like modify it a bit basically my mental model here is like if you just want to get attention you should change it as little as possible from the original one so for example what Danny did this model does not exist uh and he has like an Instagram version of it right so you want to do something that's like not nearly as cool but like still is really easy to do is like you can just take like the same idea but instead of doing it on Instagram you could do the same thing on a different platform right like you do like a tick tock version of it um where you have to figure out how to like make it so it's not just a picture anymore um it's a 3D version right that's not that's that's much harder complex you know it's much more complex than what Danny's doing um what Danny's doing isn't that complex you know like I think he said he built it in like you know a few hours a few days or whatever right so maybe it takes you a few weeks to do but you can have like a you can have like a living you know breathing in a certain sense like 3D version of a model that does not exist to your point on find something that works and remix it just a little bit that's exactly what Danny did so there were a million AI generated models that existed some of them that were successful like will Michaela from from broad which has you know multiple millions of followers but his Riff on it was like there's a bunch of photos that get generated on a website people upvote the most interesting ones and the most interesting ones get posted on Instagram so the community aspect around hey let's go and like vote on this and then people discuss it right and like sometimes the the funny part is like sometimes the AI sucks and like one of the most voted images uh last week was uh the model's name is Alice two-headed versions of A-list and everyone's kind of like voting that up to post on Instagram because it's funny right so I think your 3D model idea is actually interesting my issue with that is you want to also prioritize ease of creation so it's like how can you come up with a viral idea that isn't so hard to create and is only like marginally harder to create than what exists out there so I would be like okay maybe what does it look like to double down on social because right now he just says upvotes like maybe there's a whole comment section maybe there's like a whole social experience maybe it's just more Interactive the other like idea I would have for a lot of folks if they're trying to go viral is how do you leverage IP that is existing that you can tap into those Brands to create interesting AI offshoots Etc so you know obviously someone like Disney has a ton of Ip or you know your background in you know Harry Potter right like you know how do you create like a Harry Potter world with AI and offshoots and you know maybe you tell stories you know new stories and you know using AI et cetera so I think there's a lot you can do there that's how I think about it yeah I think another thing too is like basically most of the AI tools right now are chat Bots um and chatbots are pretty obviously like just kind of the first step because it's really hard to like spontaneously think of a thing to say to a chatbot um and like it's like bad UI most people don't use search for most forms of navigation um and so it's really obvious to me that like this is just kind of early days of AI but it was going to be is like first it starts with just a blank you know a blinking curtain a search box where you have to like spontaneously think of what you want to ask the AI or what you want the AI to do and then good UI like best practice will start to get embedded and it'll start to just like let you click between like okay do you want to make an image that's like um like this kind of art this kind of art you click on this kind of art then it goes into another you know and then you start clicking buttons and then pretty soon you have a cool piece of art at the end so uh if you want to skate where the puck is going just take all the chatbots there's like a million chat box though right there's like oh historical figures you can talk to like a chat bot that's like a store like a chat bot of Socrates or a celebrity or whatever um take those chat Bots and then just start adding uis that aren't quite so like open-ended like walk people's hand through the process more so they don't have to like try to think of something from scratch to say you can also like get distribution so what I would do is like I would probably take like the idea of a chat pop instead of having it be where people have to interact with the chatbot by typing at it um I would create like Twitter accounts and like Instagram accounts and stuff like that and so for example let's say Twitter accounts so let's say that you have like um um like a Jordan Peterson uh chat bot um well during Peterson has millions of fans and most people don't want to interact with the chatbot though so um use the use the Jordan Peterson trained chat bot to like generate content and then just like queue up like you know 500 tweets that are like fake Jordan Peterson quotes and people know they know it's robot right it's like like AI Jordan Peterson and then do that for like a thousand other you know influencers and thought leaders right so currently a thousand different Twitter accounts that are all that are tweeting quotes that are like where the AI version of them generated it um and then some of them will go viral because they're just like you know like some quote that like Jordan Peterson says is just like like the fake the AI joined Peterson says something that's like super like hilarious or whatever and then it just goes viral right and and so so you can do that though you could thought later do the celebrities you can do it with anybody basically the way that I'd start is like go look through all the existing AI tools um there's a bunch of websites a bunch of AI tools and say like okay how could I use these to make content and like algorithmically generate a bunch of content and then like create a feed that just tweets it like an example this is there's a bunch of Twitter accounts um that literally just tweet quotes from books and they have tons of followers like you can follow the 48 Laws of powerbot all that Twitter account does it has like hundreds of thousands of followers all it does is tweet quotes from the book 48 lost power um and there's a bunch of those Twitter accounts and you can easily do that for like any book that has a beginner following but you can do the same thing with like AI generated content as well like there's like a bunch of different like there's like an AI Magic card you know imagine a Gathering card generator and there's AI you know like Pokemon generators and like just take those like and then just make social media accounts out of them where they tweet a lot or post the last Instagram or whatever and then you cross remote them so for example you get one of the accounts that starts to get big like let's say Jordan Peterson when it's just doing well and then you can like retweet your other accounts from that account um so if you have like a like you know like Joe Rogan uh like AI Joe Rogan bot right uh you can retweet it from The Joint Peterson one to start getting people to find your other accounts and then um this is like the classic way that people get social followings they get one big account and they start spinning up other like accounts that are kind of similar and they just cross promote it um that's what I would do in general is like think chat Bots are like web 1.0 and like 2.0 is going to be like interfaces on top of chatbots and make it easier but if you want to go viral just like take content and then just like make a bunch of social media accounts and like post a bunch of content but try to make it so it's algorithmic try to make it so you're not having to like do spend too much time like making your own content um there's usually ways that you can automate yourself out of that if you're good at it um like the way Danny did it smart like Danny's like oh instead of having to pick the photos myself I'll like automatically generate them and let people vote for the right ones right so you can do versions of that there's lots of ways you can do that it really just my mind is just buzzing with ideas it's kind of overwhelming um and that's one of the reasons I actually created a uh a free AI Community for people who are trying to like boost productivity for folks who who are interested in in learning about tools and prompts and and chatting about other uh AI ideas you can apply for it it's free I I'll send it out in my newsletter so uh you can subscribe just you know go on your phone or however you're listening to this latecheckout.substack.com sign up to my newsletter um I also send out uh the weekly episodes of the Pod there so I mean if you're not subscribed I don't know what you're doing I include stuff like this like launching the free community Etc so and Emerson you should get in there and post your tool you said you had like you know prompts and tools that you used so you should definitely I'm so excited about using AI for learning to learn purposes like oh my God it's just like a it's a cornucopia of like exciting you most of the text is not quite there yet but it's close you know like like AI summarizers they're not quite there like barely you try to use barely summarize long articles like it still kind of sucks but like you could like it's so clearly not more than like months to like a few years away to where like it'll be able to some like really really really [ __ ] tightly summarize like a long complex like article into like a couple paragraphs um and so yeah there's just a lot to be excited by I saw uh the chairman of alphabet he he said yesterday that I guess he's getting a lot of pressure like why doesn't you know Google and what you know why is Google quote unquote late to the game with with the chat GPT competitor and his response was basically like oh AI isn't there yet it's one to two years away yeah exactly yeah big oof so I mean my take on that is you know it's a convenient thing to say and you know how could you say that AI isn't there yet when chat gbt has 100 million active users right there's definitely a lot of demand there's definitely a lot that is missing from AI but in some of these experiences but it's still pretty cool and and there's a lot going on so yep just gotta stay on it yep if you're a web 2 guy just make you eyes for AI like that's the problem right now it's still you have to type stuff that's so obviously like what you're saying there is really like you know when you call it an Uber and there's like pre-filled like be right theirs yes you're basically saying that right yep exactly like make it so that people just have to click they only have a few buttons per screen that they can pick from uh and then like help them like with just a few button Taps get to some outcome that they want they should never have to like type something in like typing should be like typing is almost always a sign of like a UI failure because most people don't have that many different use cases for whatever that product is so like just help them out by just giving them a few buttons that they can they can tap Emerson Sparks Giga brain you know it's dropping knowledge um thanks for coming on thanks for sharing some wisdom we're good people follow you criminally under followed as I mentioned where could they find you yeah I'm still I'm still uh mostly in Hermit mode right now um at some point I will uh re-emerge for the Shadows uh into the public eye a bit uh but I do occasionally tweet so Twitter would be the best it's at Emerson spartz s-p-a-r-t-z and can you confirm you're not an AI is there anything that I can say that would confirm that I'm not AI that's true touche touche all right man thanks for coming on to rap thanks man [Music] [Music] um

how would you recommend people think about what their number should be and should they even have a number in the first place I think people for sure should have a number the number you reach where you have complete control of your time you can do whatever you want money does buy happiness I found this research report that says we've been told that happiness doesn't increase above 75 000 and all you really need is 75 000 and every other dollar after that's marginal but there's this new research that shows that the well-being Rises with income and doesn't really plateau and what money can provide is financial Independence which ultimately gives you freedom and allows you to choose and pick what you want to do with your time which I think is one of the biggest factors for happiness the third thing I wrote about tied to that was most people when you read about money it's usually related to flexing most people should look at money as a tool to becoming financially independent which gives you the ultimate luxury in life freedom and time our society idolizes billionaires but it's much more realistic to become a millionaire and I think that should be the goal for most people

all right so let's start with I think one of the most interesting projects I've seen this year which is this model does not exist dot Co so I came across this uh if you go to the website it's this uh model generated by AI called A-list is that how I pronounce it I guess so yeah and it's this idea that it's an Instagram account with a new photo of a of a virtual influencer but it's not like Lil Michaela if you've seen one of those that kind of look fake like it looks real you know she's got blonde hair she looks like I can touch her and she's a real person well I wonder how many guys already fall in love with her I'm sure many guys have fallen in love with her and one of the most interesting things about it is you have this section where it says help me pick tomorrow's photo so basically the way this product works is a new photo is generated by A-list every 15 minutes you upvote your favorite photo and the one that gets most upvoted goes on the Instagram is that correct yeah well there was a plan and then until people started uploading all the messed up and messed up photos so now it's basically like one of the most upvoted photos gets uploaded to the Instagram why what happened exactly people were this is basically the the first photo is uh is her with two hats on top of each other with Cai likes to do sometimes sometimes the eyes are a bit messed up uh especially the hands it's not a good enhance but I think there's only like five percent of the photos ten percent the other 90 are pretty pretty well off but people like to upvote stupid things in the internet right think about Brody mcboatface right and and how how did you create this product how long did it take you could you talk a little bit about the process of building this from concept to pressing publish so building the product like this product I didn't I think a morning one afternoon but it's basically because I already built a tech before it with Provo picture.ai it's already had the upload functions I knew how to do the models um so I was just basically building the website and basically what it does is I just grabbed a bunch of photos from stalgun which is a it's an AI that generates like millions of fake people that don't exist uh it's pretty known generated dot photo I think it's a website that uses the AI for example so just grabs a bunch of women that look the same uploaded them into my training tool pick the ones that look like each other trained it again and basically then this this one person that looks always the same uh just came out and I've been using that to generate the photos with like why did you do this project like why is it exciting to you to build a virtual influencer so I don't I don't like the typical way of doing marketing because it's quite boring uh I'm not good in it I have tried ads advertisement I suck an advertisement the only thing I'm good in this SEO so what I like to do is I like to create products like launch mini products as a marketing so I was thinking all right so my tool is profile pictures it's basically what what was this model product is but then you can do it for your own face for other people I was like okay what is a great way to bring some attention to it and what is a fun project to hack on when I'm when I get bored and I was like maybe I should just create a fake influencer let the community upvote for it maybe some other website would pick it up because it's something novel it's something new and then basically just put a few banners every 15 photos to my main products and use it as a marketing channel um and it brings quite some Revenue which is quite fun and the plan eventually was to like maybe monetize the technology behind this I might do it still one day because it's quite exciting uh but for now it's like it's it's on the back partner you know it's five years from now you're scrolling on Instagram what percentage of your feed is virtual influencers like this how fast this is going now I'm pretty sure like I think social media how we know it is going to be dead in five years because everything is going to be fake so either people Gonna Love It Or No One's Gonna use it because it's going to be a black forest effect like everything is AI so why would you interact with a post if you can be 95 sure that this is a fake person that's hacking the algorithm I wonder if if you look at like Lil Michaela's Instagram for example Lil Michaela I think is probably the most popular virtual influencer in the world she still gets tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of likes per Post Yeah but I reckon it's because it's a novelty right it's it's one of a kind it's a one thing what if yeah but it can go both ways what if your whole feet is going to be AI generated what if you're talking with AIS to comments are AI like you don't even know if you're interacting with a real person or not it can go both waves another way to think about it is in a world where you go into coffee shops and it's all robots like it's just a robot arm serving you and making you a latte or an espresso if they make you an incredible latte exactly how you like it would you tip that robot I mean I'm from Holland we don't tip so I think that's the easy the easy answer here it depends right if you go to Starbucks you don't you don't care if it's served by a robot or whatever because it's like you want to go there you know what a taste is so you come for it but if you're going for a like a local experience you know of course you want you want a barista you can talk with so yeah it it depends I guess see my taste my take on the virtual influencers and engagement with virtual influencers my thesis is that people will still have that same level of connection with these people because they're invested in the story like look at what's happening with I'm sure you've seen what's happening uh with twitch with that Seinfeld uh AI show rest in peace rest in peace can you actually talk a little bit about how it works and so I don't know how it works so it would be like full speculations but I guess they just use openai gpt3 to just generate a lot of content and then have a narrator to to turn it text to voice I guess that's how it works it's basically for those of you who haven't seen it it's basically an AI generated endless Seinfeld parody so you go on Twitch it's actually banned right now it'll it'll come back in a few weeks but that's another story it's banned because well let me just get into it the the AI uh they had switched from chat GPT to another AI model and when they did the switch there wasn't the same level of content moderation so it ended up doing some horrible transphobic and homophobic uh jokes but basically people were going on this twitch and they were seeing these AI generated version of Seinfeld and there were thousands of people commenting thousands of people tweeting about it at any given time and it was one of the most viewed twitch channels and it just goes to show you that there's this demand for AI generated content and there's connection that exists between viewer and content well but don't you think that in five years hypothetically like why do you need content creators if if tick tock tick tock already knows so well what you like what is your interests like why would you need content creators if the AI models are so fast and gpus are so fast like why do you need anyone to create content for you if you can just create it on the Fly personalized towards you I think that's where the future is going to go to yeah I think if if AI could create better content and when and I Define better content as content that connects more with the audience then there's no place for me and you to post on Instagram yeah well it's already happening right it's like these Minecraft video backgrounds with Reddit posts um that's basically being narrated and there's millions and millions and millions of views and people have no clue it's AI generated but people basically there's one like one bot that just uploads thousands and thousands of videos and sees what gets sticky and that's what gets shows to people yeah exactly so I think that's a trend that's that's just begun and I think with uh A-list uh your product this model does not exist I I you know I could see this taking off like what does success look like for you with this product so it's still my mind to turn this into a tool to let other people create their own influencers their own characters and whatever with it I think that's pretty interesting people have already reached out on DMS to me like how can I create my own so that's an interesting point like an interesting way to go to but for now yeah it was just like a fun project man I I probably have 80d like I like to ship a lot of new products I think it's just pretty cool that it's possible to do uh it's like yeah exploring new ways learning new things seeing what is like the limit of AI right now and it's it's mental it's mental what you can do with it right now if I were you this is what I would do tell me so I would build a product Studio around your virtual influencers so one way to bootstrap any Social account is if you if you do cross posting so I would partner with like a CAA a UTA a major talent agency or some you know company like doing things media which owns some of the most popular meme accounts like middle class fancy and stuff like that on Instagram and I would say our goal is to Launch one new character influencer per month that you're gonna help cross promote and then you partner with them and do a REV share with them I would do that because it just helps you get to where you want to get to faster because your goal is the more that this spreads the more people see your underlying technology the more Revenue you ultimately create yeah this is what this will be the easiest organic well easiest would be like the way to get like a great way of marketing for this technique for this tool the thing is like I have no clue like I know how Twitter works I have no clue how Instagram works I need to dive into it see if it's interesting to me maybe I gotta partner with someone who is like interested in this whole technology in the inside like in social media is that is that a downside of being an indie an indie hacker where you're just one person is that like is there a cap to how big an indie hacker project could get to I think it's more limitation of my personality I I get Board of the three months I used to be horrible in school I couldn't focus I didn't I didn't didn't want to do my homework it didn't stick because I can only work on things that really interest me but then I can go super Super Hyper focus on it and I just lose sense of reality for like a month or whatever and I can just ship it out and then one day it's like the interest is a Content so I cannot force myself like like you saying like it could be such a good idea so if you're like an entrepreneur who who's not like me who can like focus on the things he doesn't like to do then but I know my weakness and my weakness is that I need to work on things that really interest me you follow your curiosity put in the other way you're just following your curiosity and I think the beauty about that is you're you're able to ship a product like this in a morning like when you're following your curiosity as an entrepreneur or maker it gives you superman-like abilities it allows you to do something that is impossible it's like when uh a parent sees their baby like going into the ocean and they could swim like never before that's exactly what it's like when you when an entrepreneur is following their curiosity uh my opinion the downside of just following your curiosity is sometimes you do need some sort of lanes or constraints to scale products and that's what I worry about with when you just follow your curiosity so that's a funny thing is because if you want to dive into that topic I've realized that I'm good at starting products I really like to obsess about it but that's a limit to me where I actually need someone to run it afterwards build it out afterwards so I've hired two people actually one to do the operational parts of the company doing the content creation doing the live chat so basically the operational side of the company to keep it going and I've hired a developer two weeks ago good friend of mine in his basically I build out the products I'm exploring it I'm launching new ideas and he is hired to build out once I let's say bluntly once I get bored of it and he builds out all the more boring features continues iterating and developing on it so I can move on to the next idea and see how that works I like that I think that's going to be a big unlock for you and I think once you start seeing success and and you're seeing success with a bunch of projects which I want to get into but once you start seeing traction it makes sense like to either hire agencies hire contractors build out your little team as long as you can maintain that like you know follow your curiosity like if you can just spend all your time following your curiosity like that's probably ideal for you right well but it's a it's a deliberate uh decision right um three years ago I built headlime two years ago I had talks with Andresen Horowitz Sequoia stuff like that could you tell people what headline is so people probably heard about Jasper copyright AI they are how do they brand themselves I think they're copyright they call themselves copywriting tools so they can write blogs for you emails Facebook ads Twitter ads and stuff like that I was one of the first to build a product like that and go live with it I got a screenshot from openai uh saying I'm the first developer to actually go live with a product and this was back in December 20. 2020 yeah and it miserably blew up man like people wanted this this was when opening I just went live with gbt3 basically what GPT is built on top of and it just scaled it when like it doubled in Revenue every two three weeks hits a [ __ ] ton of Revenue in three months and then it was the decision like there were so much competition like am I gonna take startup funding build out a team higher 50 developers and basically become a CEO I had a acquisition offer so I could just get life-changing amount of money sell the company and do something else or I could try to bootstrap it and I sat down for a week two weeks talk with my friends my parents my wife wife now I just knew like it wouldn't be my life to work 80 hours manage people that's not it's not going to make me happy so I'm going to do that so I decided to sell it at the time yeah I mean the sea and CEO doesn't stand for curiosity I think that in general like CEO positions are romanticized you know you're quote unquote the boss but I actually think that like if you're a maker you're a builder um okay the boss man yeah it's not it's not fun so I love that you did that and you you were mindful right the great thing about big decisions Crossroads in business life and in life is it allows you to stop and think and ask yourself what do you want like you need to figure out why are you an entrepreneur what are you doing it for why are you building this company yeah so this model does not exist is based on a product called profile picture.ai which I'd love you to talk about it's massively successful it's got thousands of customers so Provo picture.ai is you basically upload 20 photos of yourself a specific AI of yourself gets trained on your photos it knows how you look like it can basically spit out anything that looks like you so you can make a prompt that says okay Denny as a male warrior in Game of Thrones and it will just make a picture for you that looks exactly like you in the Game of Thrones style it could be an anime style and anyone already like everyone knows lensa so lensa launched one month after I launched this product um coincidence they did really well I think they earned like 30 million dollars on the app store right now should have made an app so yeah but they did they do it pretty simple and I'm actually trying to build it out into a bigger product so we're doing LinkedIn headshots um basically trying to turn it into a photo studio right now because it actually outputs photo like quality someone shared it on Twitter when he was asking followers like where do you think I made this photo and no one guess it was AI it's it's pretty mind-blowing that it's possible to just recreate photos of you so yeah it's been pretty successful I didn't expect it I thought it would be a hype um but it's pasta hype now three months I think a lot of people ask me Greg how do you build products that Foster Community well I've got good news that's exactly what late checkout does my company we partner with the largest brands in the world and fast-paced startups to design products that resonate with your community we add a couple interesting clients every single year so if you're interested and that sounds like you email front desk at latecheckout.studio with what you're working on what you need help with and don't forget to mention the where it happens pod thank you [Music] when you're building you know any startup and you see competition especially well-funded composition like lensa is highly funded Silicon Valley funded Silicon Valley based I think you get that bad feeling in your stomach at least I do when I see a competitor come out with a similar technology or product how did you feel when you when you saw it and how do you think about differentiating your product going forward so with headlime I I freaked the [ __ ] out every time a big competitor got VC funding got exposure got angry that they stole my ideas blah blah blah basically after I sold it a few months later I just saw like the competition I was afraid of didn't go that far but also what I realized is is like if you want to stay small your bootstrap or your Indie hacker it's only good if a competitor built something like you because they have the money to create awareness like for lenza for example like I got 10 times more sales after they launched a product because suddenly people like most of the people they were suddenly searching for like AI Avatar right but some people they didn't use the word AI Avatar they used AI Provo picture so where do they end up because my my domain name is they end up my my website so now these days I think like okay yeah it's great if some big shots marketing money spend their build something like me because they do the marketing for me I'll eat the scraps I'm happy with it I don't need to do 30 million Revenue because I don't have any employees to pay for them so I've I only see it as something positive right now to be honest I also think that you again you're at a Crossroads and you can decide where you want to take the product so where do you think lenza is taking it and where do you want to take it I think what lens has eventually gonna do but I'm pretty sure Instagram or Tick Tock is going to go there it's like you will have your own editor of your own face where you can just type in what you want to see right now and it just outputs the photos for you I think that's where they might had to um so I've decided not to go that route because there's going to be a lot of competition I really like to work on new ideas and build it out but I realize there's so much potential in this like the whole Provo picture it's it's massive for some reason I shouldn't share too much about it but there's like so much volume about it that it's a good way to just Niche down and just focus on that part just get really good in it and what I realized is I like to build companies that are 100 automated so I want to bring this to a position where it's 100 automated basically only has to do live chat which my wife does and then I can move on to another product SEO traffic comes in it earns five six figures a month and I'm happy with it and then build the next products added to the portfolio in maybe in 10 years have like 100 AI products doing the same amount of Revenue it's a really good realization that you had that I think that you know the Instagrams the tick tocks are obviously looking at the success of products like yours and lenza and they're like how do we get involved here so it might get commoditized and the beauty about being an indie hacker not a bootstrapper not raising money is you don't need it to be super big for it to be life-changing which is that that's also like a decision with the Indie hacker rights like you could build it into a big company you could go to millions and millions of visitors but that would also mean like if I get millions of customers like how am I going to handle the whole support load and everything it means I have to hire a whole team so it's all deliberately trying to like of course I would love to have 30 million seals whatever tonight but that would mean I have to build a bigger team I don't want to manage the whole [ __ ] team I I've got two amazing people around me now which is my friend and my wife like I trust them they're super smart people and it goes easy because I know they're they know what to do themselves without me having to manage them so it's perfect I'm still doing the same thing I just get some help with it and that's like a deliberate choice I love that I think um what's your what's your take on it what what would you do in such a situation would you be the one that grows it out bigger is there a middle way to go in a space like this which is there's a ton of eyeballs on it I think that most likely either Instagram wins like the platforms win or lenza figures out how to become the platform or the platform integrates with lenza or your product to power it so those are the scenarios I see it's very difficult to become a platform like for you guys to become like an Instagram competitor or lends to become an Instagram competitor it is remarkably difficult because of how difficult it is to build social products you know a social product you have two sides right you have the content creation and then you have the consumption although I would argue that building AI based social networks is a lot easier than building regular social networks because if you're building Instagram in 2009 you have to figure out how can I get really interesting content creators on one side how do I get the right people on and to post the right content so that they interact with it in an AI world I mean you still have to make sure that the content is high quality people are getting engaged with it but it's easier to bootstrap the network so to speak with AI but it's still make ten thousand you can make Ten Thousand Islands who are posting fake posts on Instagram right and Boots trying to throw away that's right however I do believe that people are going to assume creating virtual celebrities virtual influencers are oh I just put a prompt in and that's it like it's actually going to be a lot harder to develop great stories great Concepts that resonate with people but yeah I don't think you know building a platform is too difficult if I were you I would focus on just how do you Niche down into something that realistically the Instagrams of the world or the lenses of the world are not going to do but to you could be literally tens of millions of dollars a year of Revenue which would be significant I don't know the answer to like what that exact product is but I would do the product design Sprint around what is something that like what is something Lindsay wouldn't do well I guess they they always want to grow bigger right so they're gonna go brought they're going to use broad terms yeah if you think about SEO so if you focus on a niche keywords I think that's a really good thing to do any any startup is gonna bloat and it's the same with any other tool like if you can just take a specific little part of any big tool that people love and you're not gonna add a [ __ ] ton of features to it because you want to grow bigger then you have a reason to exist yeah I also think what you're doing is really smart with uh you know building your own virtual influencers with this model does not exist that's an example of like Instagram isn't gonna create virtual influencers like that's two quote unquote small for them creepy and creepy and they can't do it yeah and and lensa too is probably not thinking about that but I think that is it crazy that a virtual influencer brings in 500 000 to a million dollars a year of AD and affiliate Revenue it's not crazy and then could you put together 10 15 20 30 of those it's not crazy and then could you generate 5 10 15 20 million dollars of people learning about profile picture.ai because they see your technology they want to do for himself not crazy maybe I should put some more love in into this model that doesn't exist well I mean that's why that's why I dm'd you on Twitter I was like this this is a guy who understands where the world of AI is going and is building products to speak to it that are very bespoke and interesting I'm curious how his brain works what other products through your product Studio have you have you built so I build a typical build a stock photo website that's fully ran on on AI I don't know if you saw it stockai.com actually just shut it down basically the whole team around all these products I'm trying to build right now is you're trying to replace something where you need a lot of people for and you just automate it with some robots I just love building robots that work for me at night doing things that wasn't able to do before so it's okay the thing was hey all these stock photo websites they need photographers to make content for them right so I was like what happens if you just build a robot it's raining a model that's really good in stock photo style photos and just have it run 24 7 and spit out new photos so generated like hundreds of thousands of photos the problem is for now is like the quality is too low to be able to use as stock photography like it's a novelty it works for the Provo pictures worked for the 40 phases because it doesn't have to be perfect but with stock photography if there's one thing off no one wants to use it on the website so what I did is I trained the whole model on it tried to do it but it didn't get any engagement it got a lot of social press a lot of visitors and everything though the conversion rate to a paid product was like 0.004 and it's not cheap to run AI models man so if you want to keep this up I had to kill it but I think someone is probably Shutterstock is going to do this really well because they have like the whole database of photos right they could they could literally I think it two years put all their photographers out of a job and just having AI generate the photos for them just diving into the reason why this failed is it because you didn't have a big enough data set versus I stock photo who has like a massive I think the quality is not there yet that's the whole issue so you can generate all these folders right now and have a database but if the quality of the models in the AI is not good enough yet it's like such a waste of time money and resources because no one like people were barely downloading them either so I think it's too early yet and the thing is like you have unsplash which has millions and millions and millions of free photos which are really good high quality that's what you're competing with with a stock photo website so if your quality is not on par then why would people use your tool in that sense so even if I stock photo were to launch something today what you're saying is it probably wouldn't be able to compete especially for realistic ones I think like mid-journey is getting really close to being really good in artistic quality like paintings that is it could replace that but for realistic photos for real photography it's not there yet so if profile picture.ai for example I need to make sure that the hands are hidden under the table in the pockets of the jacket because it sucks in making hands all these like little limitations that it's like you could use it for a profile picture because it's fine like you can crop it out but the AI is not there yet to replace the eye stock photo get the images or whatever so this is one of those ideas that you did stock AI that it's basically a timing thing so is this something that you you would potentially revisit in 6 12 18 months yes with two caveats I want to see who wins Getty versus stability AI because Getty is in a lawsuit now with the creators of this open source model I don't want to get suits as a one person basically I was going through my head too I was like if Getty drops a lawsuit on my doorstep which they would do if I grow hard enough how I'm gonna fight it so I have to kill a product so we'll be a waste of six months working for it why does Getty feel like they could run a lawsuit here like what what grounds do they have so this whole stable diffusion AI is trained on a 5 billion image data set called lion I believe I don't know if you know the name and I think they found a few of their photos in the data set so they were like all right you trained on our copyrighted photos time to sue because they're probably [ __ ] scared that they're gonna lose their money right plus it's trained on their copyrighted images so I guess yeah they have a point if that's true you can approve it because the black box of AI and Getty is is a really big business they're about a two and a half billion dollar business I believe they're publicly traded and I noticed that I stock photo also has been teasing out some of their AI that they're doing my stock photo is owned by Getty right oh is it okay I think it is so basically it sounds like the stock photography besides from unsplash space is basically monopolized by Getty with Shutterstock having probably a little dip in the toe but for the rest here you know would you ever consider you know reaching out to Getty or Shutterstock and being like hey I built this and maybe there's a way we can partner they're going to do it themselves they could probably acquire a company that's going to do it but it's not like we said it's the focus it's not my interest I think my interest is right now in this whole official one training on the faces seeing getting to see where you can take these fake Instagram models and whatever in the stock photo it doesn't it doesn't interest me that much it does it also like I build in public it doesn't get that much engagement on Twitter either it doesn't get shared that much because it's pretty boring like who the [ __ ] likes stock photography right it's more interesting to do like some interesting businesses could you talk more about tattoos.ai it was the first one I made actually it's actually getting some sales so what I did is I made a little editor we can basically type in okay what kind of tattoo do you want let's say a bunny with a black hat um my AI at some prompt magic around it you can select the tattoo artist's style and it comes up with a flash sheet of tattoos um there was actually a guy who tattooed one of my tattoos that were generated on his leg which was pretty dope to be honest and how does the pricing model work um it's nine dollars you get access for 14 days I think I get one or two sales a day it's starting to rank on Google which is quite fun because every tattoo that gets generated I take the prompt turn it into like a search engine and then it generates automatically the pages for it so you could have like a bunny tattoo shark tattoos wave tattoos so yeah Google will pick it up if people search for it I think that's quite interesting with with a Yankee like you can churn out so much content ranking Google with it and in that way it gets search volume to your websites it's interesting that you you talk about SEO because at least the people I follow on Twitter who are in the AI space they're constantly tweeting about how you know SEO is that SEO is dead and I couldn't disagree with them more uh could you talk more about the role of AI and SEO so if you know Chet's GPT right probably everyone in this podcast knows it by now right yes you know you're not gonna go to chat gbt and be like hey um I want to make Provo pictures and then it cannot like there is search intents search and there is information search information search is going to be completely disrupted by or chat GPT like why would you go to Google and ask for a recipe you you cannot say hi that it will come back with some content but if you're looking for a solution for like making a profile picture getting a tattoo whatever like you you're still going to go to Google to find a website that can do that for you and there's no way that AI can solve something like that does the current wave of AI tools make it easier harder to rank in in Google um I don't write my copy that much with those tools because I'm afraid Google penalizes it I just think it's easier to make content in that sense because for example I have a website lendingfolio.com it's uh I sell templates for websites there like I had to hire a developer a designer wait for six months for them to make content and only then you can start ranking on Google because you made the product but with reik you can literally on the Fly producer content a user goes to your website generate something for themselves and you use it to publish on your website so your content gets created for you automatically so I think it's super easy to grow on social media in that sense like for example the tattoo like the content Rings Google likes content where people stay so if they don't if they don't bounce after like one second and say okay yeah this is garbage quality I don't want to be here like you're going to get penalized but apparently it's good quality so Google sees that you stay on the website for one minute you don't go back to the search so you're gonna stay there yeah I think like you know the secrets to SEO is exactly what you said is getting people to stay on page which is going to make something they want and then keep them on the page you just have to be you yeah there's no [ __ ] heck with it like it's I think it's such a [ __ ] sorry for the words but you just need to make things for people that they want use the keyword what they're looking for which he put on the banner of a supermarket like you so you're searching for Supermarket you see a supermarket sign right and people come to your product and have other reputable websites point to your website that says okay you know I'm the New York Times and like I'm linking to it so I think that having press having Social Links is really really impactful as well so and then a little if I if I may a little side note with that I think that's that's one of the reasons why I build in public because it generates press for your new products which means you're going to have instant backlinks like arms of backlinks on the day you launch and Google's just gonna rocket it to the top of the search engine instead of that you have to wait for like six months before they pick it up like people say I do it to sell your product I know it's literally I just want backlinks I like to share what I'm building I like to interact with the community with people I mean it's like this is how I meet you right which I think is really cool about Twitter but it's it's really backlinks that's the magic use for it what's really cool about SEO in general is you know it's a very boring way to get passive income right like you invest in SEO you don't invest in Facebook ads you invest in SEO because in 12 months 18 months 24 months you're you're seeing the dividends of all that build in public stuff that you've done all that content you're generating so I'm excited about how AI is going to help Builders uh especially Indie Builders create more content than they they've ever been able to create I think if you're making blog posts now during to the number top of Google like content marketing you're you're you're done you're [ __ ] but if you make tools and products and something like this and that's how you rank on Google I think you have future success so tattoos AI you know there's already someone with a literal tattoo your models have created you know do you envision a world where you walk into a tattoo shop and you prompt a robot and the robot just like we were talking about in the coffee shop it's like a robot arm instead of serving it serving you an espresso or a cappuccino or a latte it's just starting to draw on you in permanent ink like our tattoo our tattoo artist gonna be out of work I I genuinely I've had a lot of discussions with this like you're not going to get a machine to touch you that's I will be so scared man like there's gonna be two types of tattoo artists like some of them obviously are gonna be scared because there's certainly an AI that can do the design then on the other side I think there's going to be a lot of artists who are going to use this inspiration source that kind of generates like there's going to be a customer they can just suddenly generate like 100 options instead of just one or two show it to the customer and then they fine tune it based on what the customer really wants so I think it's going to be like an inspiration tool a way for them to communicate faster with the customers and then get to the tattoo they want why do you say that you can't imagine a machine tattooing you because like to me I can't imagine a self-driving car because the logic I make is airplanes are basically self-driving like the pilots are there just to supervise basically there's probably more room for human error than there is machine error especially as as we you know in two three four five years so why do you say that uh you can't imagine the majority of tattoos being machine-led might be because I'm scared of needles so I'd be like even more scared if a rogue right robot is going to tattoo me and I'm gonna move my arm and it doesn't register that I'm moving my arm so it's gonna start to step me or something such a wrong thing to think about because there's probably a way less error prone for a robot to do those things but I want the man you you would you let a robot tattoo you I wouldn't let anyone tattoo me because I don't want tattoos but if I if I was getting a tattoo you know if you're uh Richard Branson and you're like hey come with me to the Moon I wouldn't come with you to the Moon I don't want to be the first person or one of the first people to do any of that stuff I'm one of those people that kind of like Let Me Wait and See to see like how the first 20 000 tattoos of have turned out and like do my due diligence and then from there make a decision I do think though that the hour of progress is towards machine driven tattoos like I think that's where it's gonna go what you're probably gonna see is it's gonna be crazy at first someone's gonna do it I can like picture the press release right now or the New York Times article whatever then it's going to be less crazy because more people are gonna do it and you're gonna have human supervising the machine and then eventually there won't be humans supervising the machine most tattoos will be done by robots and a small percentage of them will be done by humans really curious kiddo because it's it's like it's an artistic process and that sense that the artist matters like my wife has a lot of tattoos and she searches for the artist with the style the way of doing it so think the tattoo artist it's not just hey I want a picture on me I find a tattoo artist to do it for me it but it might also be because that's how it works right now and in the future like how about this like uh right now I'm I have this like Cottage that I'm in in a mountain town in in Quebec in Canada and there's you know probably about 10 000 people who live in this town and let's say I go on the internet one day and I find this incredible artist in Amsterdam and for whatever reason I can't get to Amsterdam I'm just in my town wouldn't it be amazing for me to be able to walk into my like Main Street in my in my little town walk into this like robot store and basically just like how you can reuse prompts just go in and be like hey I love this artist what would this artist do in their edition of Designing my dog or my dead dog or you know passed away relative or something like that on my on my shoulder but wouldn't that be the same as going to a shady Shady store by some fake Pokemon cards and play with your friends with your fake Pokemon cards like yeah it looks the same it is the same but it's not the same in that sense like okay yeah you got the same style as the artist but the artist didn't do it does it still give you the same fulfillment you could go to a local art tattoo artist and be like hey I want this exact tattoo from that artist like yeah but it might be might be difficult to do I mean I I can't answer the question like as someone who doesn't do tattoos like or doesn't like quite hard for both of us it's hard for both of us but I I do think that if it's done right and if it's blessed by the artist I could see a world where someone is excited to get that tattoo that's an interesting future man it's an interesting future your studio is called post crafts people can check it out at postgraphs.com what's one thing you want to leave our listeners with let's say you just want to start out build a new product you don't know where to start I'd say go to hrefs.com keep on typing in keywords of things that you might be interested in until you find a collection of keywords that has a keyword difficulty under 10 which means you should be able to go to the first page of Google build a product around that that could be optimized where you could make some content with that can rank on the website build it with no code without with code or whatever and you should be able to start a site business for yourself that's the thing I think a lot of people they know how to build things they just don't know how to launch it how to Market it or whatever and I think SEO is the easiest way to start with it if you find like some Niche to operate inside of I think that that will be my tip I think everyone should launch something yes just putting it out there like man just like build something to scratch your own Niche like my first tools I build a headline for myself because I sucked in making headlines so I build it for myself and like if you're lucky someone else needs it so if you're lucky really lucky thousands of others need it and if not you build something for yourself that makes your life easier yeah absolutely I love that people can go follow Danny on Twitter uh he's a must follow uh especially if you're interested in the world of AI and your account is what at Danny p-o-s-t-m-a-a yes Danny postma with and I build in public all my startups tweet about AI mostly these days tweet about what I'm building testing and everything so give me a follow come back anytime Danny thank you so much it was a great chat [Music] thank you

Chris welcome to the show I am a stranger from the internet that cold reached out to you because I saw your app autopilot just climbing the finance charts and I was like how is he doing it and that led me to your Nancy Pelosi tracker and then I was just like okay I gotta reach out to him bring him on the pod um welcome to the show thank you foreign [Music] Journey you know we've been doing this kind of quietly for two years and then it's finally nice to say that what we've been building quite uh behind the scenes is out for the public and now the full judgment the full issues of you know what we've done the politician stuff uh uh it's about they come front and center stage so we're excited but this is my first time chatting about it so take us from the beginning you know where did the idea come from and why did you start working on it it all started though from a simple idea of what we were initially building we built out a platform called Iris that was essentially a social network for your your investment portfolios you can connect your broker you know if you had a Robin Hood I had a Weeble and our other buddy had a Fidelity account you connected to our platform you get simple trade alerts you follow each other's portfolios kind of a simple idea solve the problem of getting notifications when I was thinking about like how do we grow the thing the only way you can really get people to pay attention to what you want to do in my opinion was getting notable names but we couldn't get you know high profile Twitter guys they wanted too much money we no one really cares about the smaller guys so it's like what can we do that would get people's attention and that's where the Pelosi idea came into play this was back when she was trading Tesla this was like early early 2021. so what we did was we built out just a simple profile on Iris called it the Nancy Pelosi tracker and made a couple tweets made a couple um tick tocks about it and it blew up so everyone was like oh my goodness I can follow Nancy Pelosi's trades I can get little notifications it's fun it's riveting it's kind of a bit of the anti-establishment element that has become so popular and from there it's just taken off we had an NPR article written about us we've been on Fox News a couple of the other news stations and it also hasn't just been us um to clarify uh unusual whales is a massive massive voice in the space they brought a lot of publicity to the um to the movement of politicians in their stock trading we just saw it as an opportunity though to exhibit how our product works with someone that people would care about so the V1 was build out a profile on Iris let people follow her portfolio and get notified whenever she makes a new trade what's really brilliant that you did that I think a lot of people could do something similar is you identified a movement and you said how can I plug in into that movement right you're like okay there's a lot of people talking about Nancy Pelosi there's a lot of people talking about her stock trades better than other people it's very much a conversation that millions of people were having daily and you were just the perfect audience basically to plug into yeah yeah and the way that we thought about it too because um you know when we when we were initially launching it's like how do we grow and we couldn't grow through paid we couldn't grow through you know affiliate program because we didn't have any revenue and what I kind of thought was how do we marry the ability to display how the product works with Organic growth channels already out there um like a huge thing that I believe is social media is sort of like a web of just like the neurons in a brain everyone is just sending stuff through the dis different distribution channels but the one thing to note is those distribution channels already made you don't have to go out and create a new message a new platform a new way to tap into it just create content that can be distributed into those distribution channels and that will that's what we'll pick it up so when we saw on Twitter and Tick Tock uh everyone's talking about the politicians trading it's like okay everyone's already sending those to each other's friends they're all having the same viral thoughts at once let's find a way to capture the value of what our product provides create content around it and just literally pump it into that channel and let the channel take it from there and that's essentially what we did you know on Tick Tock you get two million views of just that and the Twitter it gets even bigger um but yeah that that's how we we kind of envisioned it and it's been nice honestly because it perfectly displays how our product works that's I think the nice thing about it too in the startup side um it's not just a random thing to get followers it's a way to actually exhibit the value prop of our product yeah I mean there's a there's a few ways to go about it like you can actually just start with the audience build up as much Buzz as possible and then be like okay I've got this audience this Nancy Pelosi tracker on Twitter and it tweets out what her trades are let me go build a product around that or what you did which was you basically had built this product and then you're like ah how do I figure out how to get people to it and then you reverse engineered how to create a bunch of attention yep yep yep exactly and the other thing too that um that we've been subtly doing behind the scenes and tapping into how other people have done it is this sort of mascot for your brand um you know Duolingo has that little bird um you know Tesla has Elon Musk and the spokespeople for these brands are great because as as an end user you don't want to follow another brand it's like I want to follow an actual person I want to follow like a movement and that's what we were able to do with the Pelosi thing the nice thing about it though is we controlled that narrative we controlled that brand it's like yes it's Pelosi it's a public figure all we're doing we're doing everything 100 legal we're just sharing what our trades are doing but we aren't beholden to anything that she can do to kind of ruin that brand because it's not necessarily married to her like the example I like to say is um like with dyspo remember when dyspo launched with um David dobrik they got all this buzz it was tremendous it was awesome they had a spokesperson for their brand it kind of represented what they did but the problem with it is year then beholden to whatever happens to David dobrik so one Scandal comes out he's gets in trouble your brand gets in trouble by having us kind of own the Pelosi tracker and just that Movement we can control and make sure that we are not only building a pro a brand that has a spokesperson but also we can control the narrative around that pseudo-spokesperson because it's owned and built by us if that makes sense okay that's another thing that we did specifically so you have this idea for this tracker you register the Twitter account like what next because like you say like okay and then you know you just make a couple tick tocks and all of a sudden two million views and before you know it you're a top five finance app take us through the messy middle it's funny because once you understand and realize that like 80 of the Internet is just content that's either rejuvenated packaged a different way or sort of pseudo manipulated you get a little bit of a better sense of how these things grow so quickly so when we started out with zero with Pelosi we just had one account Nancy Pelosi tracker we had a lot of these friends liquidity is an investor in US trust fun Terry a lot of these other meme accounts and we said okay we know this content will go viral if it's picked up in the right channel we know how to write the content that can go viral through the messaging how do we just get it into that ecosystem and that's how we just worked with Partners so when we went from zero to around a hundred thousand followers on Twitter we worked with different meme accounts to kind of pump in that content into those channels one shout out is Greek Patel so Parikh Patel he's um like a pseudo advisor investor for us we worked with him early on to say hey Parikh we're gonna write up these Tweets we're going to kind of make them built for virality we're gonna tweet it can you go retweet it and kind of get it in out out there into the public and that's exactly what we did it was that simple write the tweets make sure they go viral and use perique did you like cold reach out to Parikh no we worked with a studio bullish news tremendous people like Brian out there he he's great so we work directly with him to kind of build out these ideas and we've been working with him ever since but now we didn't reach out directly to Parikh we worked through bullish Studio okay and bullish Studios what exactly they are a talent agency for these Twitter accounts on like these Anonymous Twitter accounts uh I think they do stuff for ramp Capital free Patel is one of their big ones Wall Street badge liquidity a little bit and I think they helped them get um marketing spent and they helped us kind of launch the product but it it would have taken a lot longer if we didn't have that initial bump to get us into the viral um ecosystem so for those of you who don't know Dr Parikh Patel at Parikh Patel CFA on Twitter he's got 606 000 Twitter followers you know his bio basically says investor at Samosa Capital the world's tastiest investment fund so he makes a lot of memes Finance memes and jokes on Twitter so you went to this bullish Studio group basically we're like hey like we've got a very small budget probably who do you think would make the most most sense to go to and then you know they reach out to him and you kind of draft these tweets for him he posts it and that generates the followers back to your Pelosi tractor he he just retweets it so that's all he does all he does is um send like to use the analogy from before all he does is just send the messaging that we created into the ecosystem and then let the channel of the politician Trading you know mindset on Twitter pick it up because there's enough people out there that care about it I mean that's what we identified and ever since then um we we can sort of go we go viral now on our own um he's just an advisor with us but yeah to to clarify that is exactly how it went and I would recommend working with them if you know the audience is out there like that's the biggest problem is how do you get enough eyeballs to you as quickly as possible and working with these meme accounts memes are just so powerful because it's one thought one single thought being done by thousands of people at the same time and when that happens it's just it explodes because everyone sends it to their friends and that's how the um I think the medium ecosystem Works how do you define a meme and would you say memes are underrated or overrated for for startups I severely underrated but I would Define a meme as um a representation of a thought that can be related to by multiple people and what that means in my opinion is like if I were to say uh like what's a good example of a meme like the meme of um The Simpsons guy in the bush going out of the Bush and back into the bush you can make that Meme and say you know hey I'm a bandwagon fan I was a fan of the Warriors The Warriors lost I'll go back in now I'm a Laker fan every Sports person has that same thought they understand what it is and they can relate to that because they know someone that has gone through that experience um that translates across the board from Finance to sports to anything and are they underrated I think severely I think they're severely underrated for one reason and one reason only and it literally is the distribution that comes with it if you were to create an ad no one is going to share an ad with their friend like what no one shares even like normal tweets with their friends they share these threads that either provide value or they share memes that are funny and that they can relate to that's why I think the the power immunes are so good because it is a friend a close-knit person sending you a representation of your brand without you having to do it yeah I also think that memes for whatever reason stick in your brain just really deeply so 100 when you see that Homer Simpson uh going out of the Bush and back into the bush you you you almost transport yourself into the bush you know like you feel like you're there and human beings want to be seen as clever and people are more likely to retweet re-share a meme because they want others to see them as clever and that could be you know consciously or subconsciously yep 100 and the I think the memes go beyond just the startups too if you look at I was studying this before we even launched the Pelosi stuff of like how do we grow um that Netflix is a tremendous example of how they capture memes through their stuff I'm 99 certain that they have a team when they make this content they have a team go through the entire episodes or the videos and say what part can we Meme and turn into like a much bigger thing squid games is a perfect example of that if you look at some of their tweets their least tweeted tweets are just the normal promotions and stuff like that but when they promoted squid games with some one meme they got 10 000 more uh retweets than the other ones and that just the organic distribution of it is is just tremendous so I think it goes even just beyond startups um they did one recently with um that that girl dancing that was a trend on Tick Tock I don't know if you saw that minions was another one if you know what happened with Minions that was a meme essentially what happened with minions with minions um on Twitter or on Tick Tock excuse me there was a couple really smart guys that worked directly with um the minions creative people and said we're going to create a viral trend on Tick Tock where you wear a suit to go watch the movie because you're gonna pretend to be Gru and the Minions doing it um it picked up steam it was funny and it became a whole Trend to the point where AMC Theaters were Banning the kids from coming and it became a top selling box office kind of hit but it was a meme it was essentially a meme advertising their video just because it was funny and people wanted to be a part of the meme uh movement happening over there that plays into you know human nature of people also just want to be a part of something bigger than themselves yeah and like yeah it's just funny and it's you're you know you're going to the movie theater and like there's a sense of like who else is wearing a tuxedo or whatever and the people who are like you and the people who are not like you and and taking you know video content of it I think it's it's really core to who we are and the the downside I guess that people kind of criticize the memes for is the professional part of it but um like okay it's not as professional it's not as polished like would Apple do it and it's like okay Apple wouldn't do it but apple is Apple and this new world when you're trying to go after gen Z and Millennials people our age you know it's we we just think differently we we prefer authenticity over honestly like formality so even when we're building our app with autopilot it's we've turned politician trading into a meme it's like we run a Nancy Pelosi tracker that just tweets out when these politicians trade and the individual kind of weird Insider trades that they make when you go to our platform we tell you just how much money is literally copy training politicians and it's like did we do we think politicians trading is dumb yes did we build an app to literally copy them yes eight million dollars of the community money is already copy training politicians join the movement sign up and throw a couple Grand behind it too that's the messaging that we've had on the app and that's the messaging that we've seen work externally because the whole thing is just a pure Meme and that's what we've been trying to capture I mean going back to Apple like if you're Apple why aren't you doing memes that's fair I don't know I I think that it's not the apple way but do you think that Apple would sell more iPhones if they you know had a meme Department um I don't know if they would sell more iPhones but I think they would sell more um other services the uh another example of this is um Spotify those Spotify share your stuff like it essentially is a pseudo representation of what the meme culture is it's I'm sharing kind of something that I can relate to that I think you guys will relate to and will find funny and find interesting and create a conversation around Apple's music yeah Spotify for those that yeah so every at the end of every year Spotify wrapped they send that out um and you talk about it and it's fun it's a representation of yourself the same way a funny meme that you could repost to your story as a representation of yourself too so I don't know if Apple would use it for their um for their iPhones but like an apple watches the the smaller stuff that they that they could probably push they probably should like the VR stuff I'd be very interested to see if they uh is sort of mean that into existence a lot of people ask me Greg how do you build products that Foster Community well I've got good news that's exactly what late checkout does my company we partner with the largest brands in the world and fast-paced startups to design products that resonate with your community we add a couple interesting clients every single year so if you're interested and that sounds like you email front desk at latecheckout.studio with what you're working on what you need help with and don't forget to mention the where it happens pod thank you [Music] I was actually doing some research on some old Apple ads and I came across like the old iPod ads it's basically like red and green and yellow these like bright bright colors and then there's a silhouette with like the earbuds from uh the iPod and it was actually one of the only campaigns that Steve Jobs didn't like really my point is I wonder if like fast forward to today like if it's 2023 and apple was releasing like a music device and they were using a campaign like that where they have all these people kind of you know dancing with these earbuds and and red and yellow and all these backgrounds and Silhouettes like to me that's like that's a meme and there's so much you can do there like I wonder um did you watch any um was there any kind of humor around the airpods like it's like a meme of a meme of an airpod essentially could be everyone loses one of their airpods and then they become useless type of thing or like the the plugging in with all the different devices it might be detrimental to their brand which is why they don't do it and the future of brands are less serious Brands like I think that if you are really trying to optimize for connection and sales and just getting the word out there making fun of yourself a little bit is the way yeah so when the airpods first came out I don't know if you remember this but it was like people made fun of people who wore airpods oh they didn't look yeah the robots right or something yeah exactly there was a ton of people that made fun of people hey it looks like you have a Q-tip in your ear stuff like that and the question is what could have apple done to lean into that to sell more airpods what you just said reminds me of what Elon does with the Tesla you know how like when when Tesla releases their updates to their cars do you remember when they would um you could change the horn sounds and you could make it sound like an ice cream truck you can change whenever you put the flicker on it can make like a little fart noise like those essentially are just pseudo memes packaged into your product and Elon uses that to promote it because it's funny and it gets people talking about it he's probably a tremendous example of a modern company that has embraced humor to push marketing um I don't know if I'll do the same with Twitter but I'm trying to think of other brands that sort of do it Chipotle maybe a little bit with some of their their marketing stuff and I I think Netflix is a clear winner in that too though if if you found a niche that you want to work in and you're trying to build an audience and you're looking to figure out what the right meme culture and memes to build are how do you go about it I think a lot of it depends on the niche the niche community that you're going after um with regards to the the Pelosi one just as a simple example um we knew that that was sort of the anti-establishment anti-trustworthiness kind of element to it so when we would establish meme characteristics of the brand we made sure that we would kind of create the messaging create some of the pseudo ways to show a lot of money possible inside of trading questions suspicious and that was kind of what drove us with that when when you think about it broader though in my opinion I think it would have to depend on what the people that you're going after are saying to each other so that the messaging of the meme I think is the first part to creating the meme and the meme campaign and the template following that so you know with minions for example if if they're going after 13 14 year old kids what are the one things they're gonna they're gonna say to each other that can transition from one kid to the other um that that's an example we use of transitive messaging so it's like if I were to tell you something and you were to go tell your friend something we want to make sure that what I told you is the exact same thing that you told your friend um that's how these things truly truly go viral and if I were to start it from the culture I would study who that end user is and I would try and figure out what are the characteristics that they're saying to each other that's consistent across the board take that create a template around it and then start building content through there to add to that like what what are they talking about right now like what's something that you can capture their interest so for example like yeah Nancy Pelosi I barely knew who Nancy Pelosi was yeah literally straight up like I don't I'm not a huge yeah I don't really follow politics that much and I just kept seeing Nancy Pelosi Nancy Pelosi Nancy Pelosi to the point where because of all the stock trading stuff to the point where I had to like Google her name read her Wikipedia so I can like have a baseline amount of knowledge about her I believe it and yeah and now you do know about her though and I bet you like you know about her through the stock training through the memification of people telling you what it was like and like that's I think the the pseudo manipulation of making sure that the transit and messaging stays consistent throughout the board and I I don't know why more startups more kind of younger smaller companies don't do it because we've built a million plus followers um through this idea and it's just been me I've I've run the Twitter accounts I run all the tick tocks I run the Instagrams we've gotten banned on Instagram a couple times so we've had to come up with some different ways um and what's even interesting though is once you have that one meme you can leverage it from multiple different platforms so if you go to the Nancy Pelosi tracker on Twitter we have the Pelosi tracker and we said okay what other ecosystem kind of small community small niches out there on Twitter that we can leverage this to kind of build out more with the obvious answer that was Michael Berry it's like Michael Berry The Big Short the the recession that's a niche Community they love about that and he is a walking lead kind of just what he tweets he tweets and deletes all of his stuff who does that like that's just an interesting thing who I don't know why he does it but he did it so what we said it's like look we have a nasty Pelosi tracker let's create a Michael burry tracker not really tweet about it too much but just link it in the bio and from there without even tweeting about the Michael burry tracker we got up to 60 to 70 000 followers just from the traction from the Pelosi thing we took the Michael burry one started tweeting about it and now we're up to 130 140 000 followers on that spun off a newsletter writing about the stocks at Michael Barry owns and now have around 350 paying clients for that and then brought them to the autopilot app where people are paying to have their money just literally do what Michael Berry does but that all started from the Pelosi tracker and understanding that we can trickle in kind of more people organically by just promoting One account to grow that and Greg it's gone on now we have a Warren Buffett tracker we have a um Bill Ackman tracker we have a ray dalio tracker and we've mirrored that and done the same thing on Instagram and Tick Tock as well I think what's really smart there and just to recap what you said it's like find a meme find an in find a why now build traction through also people spreading your memes I.E freak Patel Etc then from there you can expand into different sub niches or or you know horizontal niches Warren Buffett bury Etc and what's also interesting is then you can experiment with new format types so what you said like newsletter I'm curious why did you go to newsletter why was that an interesting format for you yeah that so honestly it wasn't necessarily to launch the newsletter for the sake of having a newsletter it was more so because we saw it could live concurrently with our um long-term startup product like through our app you can copy trade these people but we only support certain Brokers we only support Robin Hood Weeble and TD Ameritrade so for all these people that didn't have it we wanted to create a platform and an alternative for them and that's where the newsletter came into play but we realized though the newsletter is a much much bigger thing than we even we imagine because one you can grow it so quickly through sub stack and two people like the they like the content that we write so like we we have a full-time writer he writes stock reports of what Michael Berry buys and we can capture and make sure the community on that is specific to bury as opposed to the community for Pelosi specific to Pelosi um and then we we plan on kind of really ramping this newsletter up um and we think we kind of can through this distribution and is there no one else doing email newsletters on what Michael burry's investing today they yeah they do but that I don't know why it shocks me that people don't tap into these kind of distribution channels are already there there's massive platforms out there one's called like Guru Focus another one is called like Watcher Guru where you can go to these platforms on they're just SEO websites and you pay to see what Barry owns and you can get little trade alerts kind of through those websites but the growth they're just pure SEO and pure blogs I don't think there's really necessarily a paid newsletter and I don't think they have any sort of social media growth um so you you could but that goes back to what we said earlier though that's the old school traditional way of building a company let's build that SEO Let's get someone to write blogs and let's try and optimize for keywords like or you just go to Twitter create some funny informative content launch a sub stack around it and start making 20 grand you know it's it's not that complicated if the distribution channels are there identify them create content and then pump the content into them it like it really is that simple when you think about it you also moved to tick tock and Instagram can you talk yeah I know I know a lot of people are interested in in Tick Tock and short form and going viral on that platform can you talk a little bit about what you did on Tick Tock yeah so Tick Tock and Instagram you can kind of in YouTube shorts you can throw into that mix too it's the nice thing about all that stuff is it's one piece of content can be posted across three different platforms with the option or the the possibility of going viral across the board and that is so powerful because it 3x is your time instead of me having to make three different videos I make one video and go from there but with with Tick Tock specifically once you understand the algorithm and you can kind of write up the hooks and the messaging to get people uh I would highly recommend everyone to start trying out and trying um and creating content for it the reason being is you can't think of it as a it started out and I think a lot of people still think of it as a social media platform or even just a way to follow your friends videos or even just kind of a way to get informative content it's it's not I think it's like the 21st Century television where I ran my own personal Tick Tock account you know the Chris J Joseph's account and I built up a brand people knew who I was they liked what we were building and concurrently we started built spinning off these different channels the Michael burry Channel a Nancy Pelosi Channel a Warren Buffett Channel and now we run currently four different tick tocks making the same sort of content across all four of them but just package for that one specific Niche Community because we know on Tick Tock that's all that matters making the content for the community that's following you let the virality pick it up if they pick it up and then see where it goes from there so your Chris J Joseph's account like what what kind of content was that and how big was it for you to start cross-pollinating the other together yeah so the Christian it's not Christian Joseph's anymore I transitioned that to um The Joint autopilot reason and um real quick the reason being is before you get big and before you launch a product if you create a personal brand more people want to follow personal Brands but the downside is you don't get as many clicks once you have the larger account you switch it we switch it to join autopilot into clicks 5x because people know they're following a brand and they see the video but um the way that we launched the initial Chris J Joseph Swan it was uh it was understanding the people that we wanted to go after um and understanding what we wanted to represent as a brand and creating content for that obvious examples of politician stuff it's like I was known for a little bit and there's other people it's not just me but I was known as the guy that would call out the politician trades they didn't know what autopilot was there was no product there was nothing it was essentially hey can you believe Nancy Pelosi made this trade again I copied her in my Robin Hood and I made 30 follow for more trades and I'll continue to expose the corruption same thing with bury and then kind of the the you can transition that out into the bigger idea of like what um is going on with the macro environment like the politicians just raised the debt ceiling this is what that means for you like that the IRS is going to come after anyone with a 600 venmos like this is kind of what's going on with your money I'm gonna help you and I'm gonna represent and I'm gonna call them out for it follow me for more and that's where we were able to transition it into the new thing but one thing to note though Greg is uh it's much harder to cross pollinate you got to create different channels and just stick to those channels I I just create eight different videos for each Channel but I'm talking about the same stuff and then I use those same ones and cross-pollinate on Instagram and on YouTube shorts and how big has The Tick Tock and Instagram Empire gotten and how long did it take you so The Tick Tock one I started back in probably early 2022 or around um and I went probably four months without posting and you just get burnt out um we are at 150 000 followers on that account and that with our old app got us we we grew our iris app to 150 000 downloads mainly through Tick Tock all organic which is a big deal in the in the fintech space right because I think what a lot of people don't realize is a TD Ameritrade will spend three hundred dollars to acquire a customer so if you have a hundred and fifty thousand users times three hundred dollars that's you know a big number I don't know what that I mean it's it's a lot more than what we've ever spent it's probably more than we've probably more than what our company was worth but yeah that's the funniest thing in the space and you know when we chat with even just people on Twitter and other investors and whatnot they're one thing is like how how are you going to grow and it's like you're going to spend thirty dollars per customer it's like no we know how to use social media one of our emotes is like we're just good at it like this is kind of the skill that I have and I don't know why I take a very philosophical approach to it but the our cacks have been zero you're like we have not spent necessarily any money directly to acquire users we've spent some money to build distribution that's one thing to note but we have not spent money to actually get a user in a space where the average tax are at 60 bucks Robin was paying like 80 bucks or something like that during the peak of cobit to get a user and Robin Hood is supposed to be like wow how did they acquire user for 80 bucks you know like that's supposed to be that's cheap in like traditional brokerages so I think um yeah I mean the only money you you're actually spending is you know perique Patel type stuff and of course the time required to create the content yeah and we launched that iris app and um it didn't have product Market fit just because we didn't do it right and also the Market's tanked we started from scratch built this iris of the autopilot app and the autopilot app now has around 53 000 downloads we launched yesterday two days are we launched on Thursday so we launched a couple days ago but that app already has 53 000 downloads zero dollar CAC all just through the messaging and I haven't even formally announced it yet um like I haven't made a formal announcement on on our Twitter accounts this has all just been through prior building up through um pre-orders on the App Store and we're making solid money too which is insane you know we're at 220 000 ARR um we tried to pass cash app and what's even funnier is we bring users to Robin hoods to the Weebles to the fidelities because people join our platforms like hey I want to follow Pelosi but I don't have a broker yeah go open a Robin Hood that's why I think what we're doing is valuable for the institutions as well because the fintech space is the most expensive CAC by far and the the payback periods are 12 to 18 months as well so we circumvent all that through messaging so you talked about you know memes building the audience the different channels a little bit about the product but I wanna I wanna dive deep into the product and what the vision is we think of the product in kind of four different stages we here's like a question that we like to ask our community um the largest wealth transfer is about to happen over the next 10 to 15 years or something around like 45 to 60 trillion dollars is about to pass from Baby Boomers to their to The Heirs 75 of those errors when they receive that money fire their parents financial advisor the same day they get that money so there's about to be a plethora of trillions of dollars out there saying I want to invest my money where do I go what do I do what do you do with it it's and that's I think like the biggest thing and that's what we're trying to go after do you go to in you do you go to Google and kind of say hey find me a local financial advisor do I go to my my stalker on Twitter or Tick Tock saying okay this guy's investing this I'll pay for the service to kind of buy his trade alerts in his portfolio or do you try and do it on your own the massive vision of what autopilot will be is a Marketplace for you to go to our platform find vetted professional people that transparently show their returns and publicly say what they believe in and then just sort of choose them to have them manage your money if I got a 40 000 bonus from my Facebook job you know I can go to autopilot put it in Robinhood and say okay I want to choose this guy I'm going to have 20K autopilot this guy I'm gonna have 10K autopilot this guy and then I'll put 5K behind Pelosi and I'll have all the money still in my Robin Hood but I'll have the decision making and the hard part done by someone who actually is good and takes it seriously how like worried are you about like the the institutions and the robin heads of the world just copying your features and adding it to their platforms we're not too worried about it honestly the the analogy we like to give is um the same thing that patreon did for creators we think we can do for financial advising and financial wealth management Instagram has their own subscription service where I can pay x amount of money to kind of get exclusive access from this Creator Snapchat has their Snapchat Plus or whatever where I can pay a why amount of money to get access to that Creator but the Creator is on every single platform so what's the best solution for the Creator to limit themselves by that one individual platform or use a patreon or a fanfics or a Lincoln bio have it there and then be able to monetize every single person across all the platforms if you go just the specific Robin Hood way they can launch their own pseudo financial advisors in their own pseudo wealth managers but those wealth managers will just generally not make as much money if they go down the route that we want to go down um as opposed to a a platform that lays above them all um and Robin Hood could like they could launch their own Financial Services accounts we think though the ability for someone to launch their own hedge fund or their own ETF or anything like that anyway you we can't necessarily use those words so it won't be like that but we want to be a platform for someone that is good at investing to make a living investing and just let people follow them and copy trade them any anytime you're you're building a startup you have to start with a feature and the obvious question is well can't insert incumbent XYZ here just copy that feature right and I think like yes they could but first of all by the time they copy that feature you'll probably be a threat to them in which case you're kind of chilling you know in the sense of like you've got millions of users okay they're gonna copy the feature that's not great but you know you've gotten pretty far you're essentially series b or series C once you've gotten there the the idea is that you know They're copying you 12 18 months 24 months even before They're copying you in the past right and you're marching towards somewhere else in the future so I think that as long as you're understand where you're marching to and you're continuously being extremely purpose built around the core feature that you're building for that's when you have an opportunity to be a real threat and people could have asked and I'm sure they did in 2011 Robin Hood what is an E-Trade or TD Ameritrade just come up with a mobile app and do zero free Trading well most of them did eventually but by the time they did Robin Hood was a 10 billion dollar company yeah what did Robin Hood do so well at the beginning that they kind of then Grew From it was the zero commission trading that's what got everyone involved in the ecosystem for us the analogy is copy trading Pelosi you know they Robin Hood went Way Beyond just is hero they they launched options trading they have you know the bank accounts they have the credit cards debit cards we are trying to capture everyone kind of to your point that what you've been writing on Twitter and Linkedin is through that one Niche community and then expand from there the Pelosi stuff the Bill Ackman the Warren Buffett's that is what gets everyone into the door and then once they're in the door we sell them the actual Traders we say hey we got this guy from Goldman Sky manages 250 million dollars throw a couple Grand with Pelosi you throw 50 Grand with that guy because he actually does it for a living we we are a big believer in that and you don't have to be married to that one specific reason why everyone came in from the beginning as long as you have a way to transition and showcase to that user the bigger picture and that is our bigger picture it is the the sort of have your money managed by someone that you can trust and you know is good what this has really been is like a master class for people to understand how to think about memes how do you think about building audiences how do you build a product around it and how to think about the North Star um I agree with you I think that there's a ton of Nancy pelosi-like memes that people could jump onto and create products around and it's it is remarkable that you don't see more companies start from memes but I think that that's a trend that's only going to accelerate there's a reason why we have them on our cap table we have all the major meme accounts on our cap table so what's the biggest strategic investor you know liquidity that has 600 000 followers on Instagram that can retweet anything you want or uh repost or like a guy that can help you with growth marketing through paid ads it's like I'd rather have liquidity because we do the same thing for me because he's an investor he's a tremendous guy or girl but um last uh last question uh before we wrap if you're trying to build an audience be it your personal audience or brand what's the biggest piece of advice you can give people that it's be authentic I think like that is the most powerful thing that people truly truly don't captures like just talk to people like a way someone normally would talk to you you know whether that's through memes whether that's through Twitter whether that's through Tick Tock anything it's people are afraid to just talk like a normal human being and they want to come off as this professional polished idea and that's gonna work less and less you know there's a reason why everyone skips over ads because you know it's an ad but you don't skip over an ad if it comes across as authentic and genuine so if I were to say if you were to build a brand it's speak to the way that you normally would and just be honest with what you're comfortable with saying and just make sure you do it in an authentic way that's why yeah Pelosi stuff I write literally the way I would say it and I think it works because of that it's easy to fall into the Trap of Lemmy word Smith this as much as possible and add fancy adjectives here and there and try to sound really smart and and really academic but we forget that we're all just people at the core and you know we want messages that are simple and that we can connect with and I think that that's the opportunity is just be authentic speak plain have fun yeah and and I really like uh Toby from Shopify the founder of Shopify his like armed the rebels framework thinking about memes in the same way which is if you're focused on a niche or you're focused on a community and you want to arm the rebels well maybe you arm them with memes to start and see where that goes then once you do that build the product around it that's exactly what we did with the Pelosi stuff we said hey we're going to call out these politician stuff and we're going to make it and message it and in a funny simple clear authentic way go retweet It Go repost it do whatever you want with it and it's worked so yeah I think I'm gonna study that arm the rebels I didn't hear I've never heard of that one before so yeah all right where could uh where could folks follow you and autopilot to follow the journey yeah Twitter so my personal Twitter uh Chris J Josephs from there I kind of tweet my little Mantra there is I like to expose how our money is managed you know VC is investing in dumb stuff I want to call out politicians wasting our money I want to call out um that's kind of the brand and what I've had fun with tweeting about and then if you want to follow joint autopilot that's on Twitter and the obviously the Pelosi tracker which is um something that we'll continue to push forward and we'll try and continue doing it I I honestly hope they get banned like they shouldn't be able to if they get banned it's bad for our business but I think it's better for society and it's better for the trustworthiness of our government so we'll see what happens but that's our that's where you can follow us all right man it's been real cool [Music] foreign

and shouldn't that be the advice for most 20-somethings like have a bad two-year plan but a great 10-year plan I think in some ways you always yeah one of the issue issues with people in their 20s is they end up doing these stupid jobs where they go work in the soulless corporate environments where they get paid to learn and sometimes that's true but the majority of people I know who justify what they're doing with hey I'm learning a lot it's okay I don't like it that much but I'm learning a lot most of them are having a lot of the ambition a lot of the agencies sucked out of them and I actually think that's quite tragic I think that your 20s are a time of peak creativity you have less to lose than at other moments in your life but on a cohort basis people in their young 20s should be taking risks they should be trying to be ambitious and the other thing that people they're young 20s don't know is that everyone is willing to help you when you're young

curation is valuable so if I can curate five things ten things or you know write a little quip here and there that's great it's not a business right it's a part of a stack if you're a Creator you should at minimum have one of those and you may actually say well that's all I want to do because my main format is podcasting right my main format is Twitter I think you need again to have some connection but that's not a business I think too many people think they're five sentence Roundup or whatever is a business and it's not it's just a part of your extension of your brand it's necessary but not sufficient for success in building your creator stack

I uh I got a flat tire yesterday and my immediate reaction was I got a flat tire this sucks yeah tow truck's only coming in two hours and uh you know I hit a pothole basically and you know potholes are avoidable sure and you can sit there and just be like initially I was kind of like wow this sucks but you know I was like you know in the grand scheme of things the grand scheme of things it's just a flat tire yeah so we had a flat tire with uh a few flat tires coming into this sorry about that well I appreciate you having me on thank you of course welcome welcome to the show I've been following you for years now because you put out some of the best content around buying businesses I would say micro businesses um so small to medium-sized businesses and you know I reached out to you because I wanted just to meet you and catch up and then I figured why not give the benefit of the listeners to have that catch up so let's dig into it [Music] I just got off reading your annual letter and I would love for you to tell folks why you write annual letters and what was in this one that's a big question uh yeah right angle letters um to keep kind of all the stakeholders that we have informed I mean we've got kind of three big kind of pockets of people uh one are the people who we work with right so the portfolio company leaders employees people at the firm here uh are investors and then people who potentially would be partners on opportunities and we found that the best way to repel the wrong people and attract the right people is to put out content that says who we are and what we do and so yeah the annual letter was um a reflection back actually it's been 15 years since I haphazardly started permanent Equity or before it was even called permit equity and so it's a kind of look back um some announcements on new hires we did to a couple new deals uh this year and I'm just trying to do uh look back and and kind of take stock of where we've been do you think more companies should do annual letters I know chamoth did an annual I don't know if he still does it but he was doing annual letters of course you know the Berkshires of the world do annual letters like you know is this a trend that we think is going to accelerate I mean I think there's a lot of organizations that I see that that kind of do an annual wrap-up or an annual letter um I think it can be super valuable it depends on what you're trying to do with it I mean I read a lot of annual letters that um look like victory dances uh when things are going well and and look like excuse Fest is when when things aren't and I don't think that is maybe as uh valuable I think you know just trying to be be who you are I guess in all situations including your annual letters probably the way to go I think what's cool about doing an annual letter is like probably once a year you really need to re-evaluate like what's happening what's the state of the world how you know where is the wind blowing where the Tailwinds where the headwinds and it's just beneficial just to like sit down I love like you called A letter like it's not a letter it's a blog post or a PDF realistically you know that's why yeah that's why I really like it I mean it also gives people like me like I feel invested in permanent Equity I read the letters so I feel like more people should go and publish if you have never published a a yearly letter if you're listening to this it's work it's worth doing yeah yeah I would agree I mean again tell people who you are and what you're trying to do and it will attract the right people and repel the wrong people absolutely so when I was reading your letter before this I didn't realize how big you were so today you know your portfolio of companies you know 700 full-time employees and you've got just under 350 million dollars manual Revenue so the scale has become big um now obviously the economy is weak right now how are you feeling about 2023 and permanent equity having a portfolio of companies you're going to have some that are going to do better in certain environments uh than others and the nice thing is that we're very different than traditional private equity in in the sense that we don't um typically put any debt on the companies so um for us we have a lot of operating flexibility I mean we can you know earnings can go down 50 60 and everyone still keeps their jobs and we actually had a conversation yesterday we were in Dallas with a new acquisition and we had this conversation with them we're like hey if you all think that things are going to be tougher this year than they were last year like let's not miss an opportunity to invest in people and technology and hopefully come out the other side of this way stronger when everyone else is retreating and entrenching let's be aggressive um because we have the ability to do so because we're not holding to a bank in covenants and taking all the free cash flow that we have and sending it to a to a financial institution so um we really encourage our companies when there's adversity like don't miss the opportunity for a good crisis and um served us well for folks that don't know permanent Equity super well can you can you talk more about what type of businesses you'd like to to buy yeah so we acquire majority Stakes so we're always doing majority uh buying a majority of the equity in small family businesses that are typically family run as well um so these are when I say small these are maybe not depending on what most people think this is a small business these aren't the local sub shop or you know hair salon these are typically pretty good sizable businesses making between three and fifteen million dollars a year of earnings typically revenues of call it 15 million to 150 million kind of in Revenue so I mean there's you know these are these are pretty chunky chunky companies and um yeah we like to partner for the long term so we're technically private Equity we buy equity in private companies but the term private Equity comes loaded with a lot of meanings and typically what it means is you know we call it the buy lever strip and flip model so you buy the company you put as much debt as you possibly can on the company so you can put as little equity in and um if everything goes great then the equity returns look fantastic if everything doesn't look great then then there's a good chance the company detonates you have to make some really hard choices which usually means to cut people and then they're looking to make significant changes in the business and then sell it to somebody else within typically a call it two to five year time Horizon so we do it in many ways the exact opposite so what we do is we buy with no intention of selling the business we typically use no debt in the transaction we love to keep leadership teams in place we don't uh we don't replace the leadership typically unless there's a sort of acute problem and um we hold them definitely and partner with them and try to be kind generous long-term Partners it's really a first principle is rethinking of of what private Equity is and and should be and I mean really just came from looking at how did families build wealth in the first place like I've never met a family who's like you know what we did was we levered up a company to the moon and tried to change it within a short period of time and then flipped it to somebody else it's not at all what how typically wealth is built within families wealth is built by you're passionate about what you do you become good at it you Faithfully serve your customers over decades and compound and so that's what we're trying to do as well could you give some examples of like what types of businesses that are like yeah so we've got a very diverse pipe portfolio we own um a swimming pool builder we own a the heisen matchmaking firm so executive Search but for love um very interesting business we own a military recruitment firm uh picture frame manufacturer uh fence Builder I mean it's it's really all over the place so Services manufacturing construction um we really uh we want to get involved in things we think of as like Main Street businesses things that are going to be around for a long time uh enduring need for them really enjoy just sort of the the Main Street how do you deal with acquiring a business that you really don't have domain expertise in so for example like you might realize you know swimming pool business is a huge opportunity the numbers make sense to you but you know you don't know the first thing about how much chlorine to put in a pool yeah we never are experts at the businesses that we acquire in fact that's a you know we think of as we're the experts in the business of business so you know we joke that everything tastes like chicken layer of business where no matter if you're doing pool building or matchmaking or you know um recruiting for the military it's all the same things you need you know marketing advertising Sales Systems you need accounting systems you need to make sure you're in compliance taxation HR systems recruiting means all the things that are the business of business uh is where we really feel like that we want to build expertise and we want to partner with firms that are deeply knowledgeable excited about talented in the thing that they actually do so you know we always say we're not going to be involved with the company that wouldn't be successful without us what we're trying to do is be good long-term partners and bring a talent about the business of business to them that typically most small businesses lack I mean we like to say often that small businesses don't say small on purpose there's a reason why they stayed small and usually there's some Lids on the business that we're able to release over over time that help the business grow I recently had uh Nick Huber on sweaty startup um and he has a really good saying which is you know if there's a fax machine in the building chances are there's an opportunity meaning you know there's a lot of Technology efficiencies when you see a fax machine because no one's really using fax machines do you think a lot about or do you encourage your teams to think a lot about technological efficiencies yeah I would say in some ways it's fool's gold and in some ways it is real gold and it just depends on the situation we actually we bought a company a couple years ago that um the we couldn't figure out why the orders weren't coming in and then we finally figured out it actually went to a fax machine that the fax machine was unplugged we plugged in the fax machine and orders started coming out so yes there are things like that that you can do that will improve the technology of the firm I would say the thesis that you're going to come into a small blue collar you know sort of Main Street business and transform the business in any sort of reasonable time frame with you know fancy technology is likely a pipe dream you're going to have a lot of cultural entrenchment a lot of inertia you're going to break a lot of systems and people in the process by trying to implement that especially quickly now over time time of course we always want to be pushing the companies to be sort of the Kaizen approach right the constant Improvement of the company I would say many because of the time Horizon of many investors being so short they don't have the patience to actually compound that technology advantage over time and so they've got to come in and break everything which by the way you can do and it'll work it just increases the range of outcomes that you should expect right so if you don't come in and change anything you should probably expect the company to perform kind of How It's performed in the past the more you start changing systems and changing out people it increases the upside opportunity but it also increases the downside opportunity so you just have to be careful uh when you start doing that what is the uh Kaizen approach it's just an idea that like you always want to be constantly improving every day in in sort of measurable ways so you know it's this idea it's just continuous Improvement right uh it's it's an idea that you know just because something's not broken doesn't mean you can't make it better and I think that's where a lot of we see small businesses fall into this trap of like you know so if it ain't broke don't fix it which leads then to have these Lids on the business that really keep them from growing and so we encourage our leaders to do is to say hey look um when everything's going great like let's not take it for granted let's continue to push the advantage and when everything's not going great uh let's use that maybe downturn and some slack in the system to improve everything like how do you think about technology businesses in general a lot of people who listen to this this podcast uh either run technology businesses or work for technology businesses it sounds like primarily the businesses you buy are more like brick and mortar type businesses is that is that fair to say yeah I mean we actually have one software-based business that we acquired uh last year which is I mean there's technology in every business but but that was a more technology forward business that we that we acquired so we're not luddites but yeah I mean what do I think about technology businesses I think they're incredible I mean I think that once you have an advantage and you know the the business model of a lot of these technology businesses are some of the best in the world right I mean software as a service is an incredible business model recurring revenue is is stickier than project-based Revenue there's a lot of advantages to it and Technology can do incredible things right in terms of you know specific businesses I think there's an ease in in sort of a hype cycle that I've seen where you know um maybe crappy business models get lumped in with great business models because it's all under the umbrella of technology and they get funded in a way that um doesn't make a lot of sense to me but that's not my world right and I mean there's a lot of people who are a lot smarter than I am who have done very well for their investors and have done very well by companies by funding things that I wouldn't have expected to work but again um we all have our our role to play my take is I think your motto would do really well in the technology World especially going into 2023 uh valuations are going down you know I haven't announced this publicly but we we just acquired a business that if you would have told me a year ago or two years ago I would have been like there's no way that team is willing to come work with us you know not that just just in the sense of like people are more interested to come together now uh during times like these and so you know valuations going down teams more willing to join uh bigger bigger companies um and then with you also like you said you said you said that hey like we're not experts in the swimming pool business we're in the you know business of business I'm pretty certain that your model I you know I'd love to hear more about how you underwrite businesses like how do you think about paying for businesses is it like you know a three to five times earning thing or how you think about it but yeah why wouldn't your model work for technology well it might I mean I again we bought a technology business last year so I think it I think it does my my um gut reaction is that the um competition and what people are willing to pay for technology for businesses is is typically just more than we can get comfortable with um so you know when we look at buying 10 million dollars of cash flow for 50 or 60 million dollars right and it's pretty predictable it's hard to go from that to paying a revenue multiple on something that has very little earnings and so it just it feels like a very different shift in the world now I understand why people pay what they pay for the technology businesses and there's people who do an excellent job of stripping out a lot of costs and you know I hate to use the businessy term Synergy but like creating synergies between businesses um I mean there's plenty of firms that are known for doing that you know we like to keep businesses intact and independent um and we'd like to take a a humble view I think the humility is is something I talked about in the annual letter the forms of humility that we try to exhibit are not only in not using debt and being humble in terms of what we know about the business and don't know about the business but also in the price that we pay if you pay a ton for a business the expectations are Sky High you've got to start doing a lot of things to generate that return if you pay a little bit less expectations can be lower and you can take your time so you know I think that we would not be opposed at all to continue to acquire and partner with technology companies we would love to do that if expectations were reasonable and I think there's a lot of publicly I don't fault technology owners for saying hey if somebody's willing to pay me you know 10 times Revenue over here and you're willing to pay me seven times free cash flow over here like I'm gonna choose the guy who's willing to pay me a lot more great no problem at all a lot of people ask me Greg how do you build products that Foster Community well I've got good news that's exactly what late checkout does my company we partner with the largest brands in the world and fast-paced startups to design products that resonate with your community we add a couple interesting clients every single year so if you're interested and that sounds like you email front desk at laycheckout.studio with what you're working on what you need help with and don't forget to mention the where it happens pod thank you my thesis is I think you're going to see a lot more inbound of Technology businesses in 2023 and I think some of those valuations are going to be reasonable and I think a lot of them are going to come from indie developers and teams so the equivalent of family businesses and Technology are these Indie teams where you're talking about two or three people who've iterated on a product I'll give you an example I just saw that a product I was using called tweetthunter dot IO was just acquired it's like a um build you know build and monetize your Twitter audience fast you know it's a monthly subscription uh I think they've got acquired for 1.8 million dollars my hunch is that that was like a reasonable valuation given where they were at that's one of the reasons why I wanted to talk to you frankly is because you know as we get more acquisitive in 2023 I think like yeah I guess this is a question for you which is how do you value a business great question I mean I think this is where uh at the end of the day what everyone's trying to do whether they understand it or not is trying to Value how much cash is going to come out of the business and win right I mean that's ultimately how any business is value the present value of future cash flows now there's a lot of differences in how you value and how you think about the cash flows that will come out and there's a lot of preferences for some people are fine delaying those cash flows for a very long time and some people are very excited about having those cash flows now and so this is where the the differences in valuation and preferences in the marketplace you have one person who's um excited about cash flows now they're probably not going to acquire a technology company with no cash flow and maybe even that needs to needs more at reinvestment ultimately what that technology company is trying to do is build future cash flows through Investments now and this is where you see incredible businesses like Google and Facebook or you know highly unprofitable for a period of time and then flip to profitability and now they just gush cash and you know uh it's incredible if you if you you know looked at their income statement in the very beginning it wouldn't have looked anything like what you see now and so that's the maturation of the business over time um in technology in particular is very sort of asymmetric and non-linear and so I think that's where you know I don't have a good predictability of a business that goes from you know losing a million dollars to losing 10 million dollars to losing 150 million dollars to losing a billion dollars like I don't have a lot of vision for how that business then ends up making 5 10 15 billion dollars down the road right I just see a lot of losses and you know seemingly a lot of ways to to lose money in that opportunity other investors see that and say that's exactly what they should be doing this is perfect they have all the heuristics and and sort of mental shortcuts to be able to see through the noise I just see noise now somebody else takes a look and says hey you know we just bought a really large fence Builder you know they literally put pickets in the ground and brackets and they build fences like these are not complicated residential fencing I look at that and say okay I I know what the demand for fences is I mean I can predict it based on net population migration I can look at it based on housing starts um the replacement cycle of fences you know you can sort of look at the predictability of that and you can see you know what is the labor flow look like what are the customer bases look like and you can extrapolate out okay over the last you know 10 years they've gone from X to Y to Z it looks pretty linear to Me Maybe we can come in and add some you know again sprinkle on some of the business of business that maybe they're lacking in de-risk the business increase the quality of earnings and hopefully quantity of earnings over time that feels much more predictable to me and so I can more easily value a business where I can see cash flows and can see the trajectory of cash flows than something where it's going to take a lot of reinvestment back into the business and a lot of assumptions to understand what what the present value of those future cash flows would look like and do you do you have a model for like we won't pay more than 7x earnings or we generally pay 3x earnings do you have boundaries that you set for yourselves when you're when you're valuing businesses yeah I mean I would say we maybe we can talk about the lower and upper bounds um so the lower bounds it's you know if you see a business that um you think has durability and you know is transferable you know a lot of smaller companies are just not transferable we we call it own remote where all of the value of the business is tied up in the Goodwill of the owner so the owner leaves all the relationships all the skills um everything kind of falls apart they're the linchpin right so a lot of businesses are just not transferable but if you see a business that you think is transferable and is durable you know three three and a half times uh true earnings so not ebitda depending on the capital intensity of the business but truly what is discretionarily coming out of the business um on an annual basis in terms of cash flow you know three three and a half times is really the lower bounds and that's going to be a situation of typically distress you know there's gonna be some some distress factor maybe it's age maybe it's illness divorce um there's gonna be some you know midlife crises happen um or three-quarter life crises happen I mean you know there are some something that's happening um where the the person who owns that says look even though I could probably get a higher price elsewhere I just don't want to go through the hassle and I want to find the right place for that for that asset you know three three and a half times kind of a lower bounds I would say of that you know on the upper bounds we have paid ten times in the past for a business I mean 10 times the question is 10 times what right it's a multiplier of what so you know my I always joke with owners and they're like well I was really hoping for seven times I say look you can make up a number and multiply by seven that's whatever you want to do um seven times what's the question so when you look at it you know typically what the multiplier is okay is it is it seven times previous year earnings is it seven times what we project to be the future year earnings is it seven times a blend of the last three years is it seven times ebitda is it seven times cash flow is it seven times earnings is that pre-tax post tax I mean you know you can do all these like you know multipliers of what really matter what I would say is of discretionary cash flow is sort of normalizing for Capital expenditures um and for reinvestment sort of necessary reinvestment back into the business you know we paid 10 times but that was for a business that was incredibly fast growing and that we felt high confidence in and we were able to get some preferential treatment in terms of the share class that we were participating in so look we paid three times for a business we've paid 10 times for a business those would kind of be the I would say rough you know yardstick to use in terms of range most of the time we're paying four five six times and again four five six times what uh four five six times what we think is going to be the trajectory of the business in the future it doesn't matter if you made you know 10 million dollars last year if you're going to make two million dollars next year you can't value the business on 10 you got a valued on two so we're always trying to understand what does it look like for us to be in the owner's seat and what do we predict to be the cash flows coming from it do you have any insight into when an owner should consider selling a business I talked about on the Pod uh in my you know 2020 to recap uh podcast that we had an offer an eight-figure offer to sell our business and we decided to decline it because you know we really like what we do we want to do it forever that kind of forced us into the position of like thinking about it do you think that just just like how you know every year you sit down and you write your letter should should a business owner every year sit down and be like should I sell my business I would say no I think that largely if if going through the exercise of do I want to sell or not is um unless there's a reason to I don't think it's a very fruitful exercise I mean you know you should understand what you have but I mean look if you think about it in terms of Private Business versus a public business if you owned a publicly traded company Greg like you would have prices shout out to you every second of every day of exactly what people think the business is worth right does that mean you should sell your position in the company just because somebody's shouting you a price like probably not right I mean you should yeah I'm proactive right yeah it's just different absolutely for private business owners because there's no one shouting prices typically at private business owners right so when somebody comes inbound and says hey this is how I value your business and you're like oh that's flattering that's interesting right I'm you know it kind of perks me up like I start thinking about what would it look like to not own this business anymore what would you know would I rather have 10 million dollars or would I rather have the business that's a good question to ask but no I I yes to answer your original question are there good reasons and bad reasons to sell a business absolutely um the good reasons would be changing lifestyle um a change in in sort of Need for time I mean again death divorce sickness are our three really dominant factors that typically you know reorganize somebody's life but there are plenty of others I mean we've bought businesses from people who are like hey I you know I've just figured out that I want to be a painter and as much as I you know enjoy the people and enjoy the business like my real passion is getting in art studio and painting fantastic that's a great reason to sell the business so there's a lot of bad reason to sell businesses though too you know primarily uh ego which uh you know I don't know how many people I've heard say well you know my buddy at the Country Club said you know he sold his business and he seems happy and so I figured everyone else is selling their business I should sell my business too and now I want to you know try to put up as big of a number on the board as I can so I can brag to my buddies about it that does that's not a great it's not a great reason um another not good reason is you know I want to time the market and I want to try to you know I know the business isn't going to do very well in the next five years so I'm going to try to screw somebody over and offload the steaming bag to them like that's probably not a good reason either um so you know I think that good deals are win wins for the buyer and the seller and that's ultimately if you can't look somebody in the eye and tell them that you think it's a win-win for both sides and I don't think you should do the deal uh shifting gears a little bit just I need to ask you I heard a little birdie told me that you had you had lunch with Charlie Munger once is that true I did yeah it's fantastic I mean uh Charlie was uh incredibly gracious and kind uh deeply thoughtful um very opinionated I like people who speak their mind and tell you tell you what they actually think and he certainly he certainly did that I mean it was a it was a fantastic time it was it was a great opportunity to sit at the feet of an elder who's been there and done that I mean I think I'm you know more broadly just I'm a big fan of asking people who have a lot more life experience than me and have done things that I would you know aspire to when they do you know ask about their mistakes ask them about their triumphs ask them about what they would want to know you know what I should be asking them even you know so got to ask them a lot of questions that you know is all off the records I can't really talk about you know what we necessarily discussed but it was a wonderful opportunity I'm really grateful for it I mean I see some similarities between what you're doing in Berkshire but also some differences could you can you talk more about that yeah I mean we're not trying to be anybody but us and I mean you know kind of directory the business that I run you know when we first started having cash flow you know you become an investor by default you're like okay I have excess cash what am I going to do and I you know my late 20s I was blessed to have a business that was Cash flowing growing and uh exceeded dramatically My Lifestyle needs and so um you know when you have money left over you start saying okay what should I do with it and you know during that period of time I spent probably two full years studying what I would call like kind of a the investing grades trying to understand what they did what were the mechanisms they employed and they're very different right I mean you read thorndike's book The Outsiders you know there's a really good uh kind of introduction to a bunch of people who are um some of the best investors of all time but like how John Malone did it it's completely different than how Sam Zell did it which is completely different than how Warren Buffett and Munger did it yeah I mean I would say we we try to take the best of what we liked about each model and you know be first principles thinking about our own model and um then just try to be us I mean you accumulate knowledge and experience and so in terms of Berkshire um you know they grew what I would call up in the market so there's kind of two ways to grow this is maybe something we we want to discuss but one way to grow is I think the more traditional way which is you do a deal and then you do a bigger deal after that and you do a bigger deal after that and do a bigger deal after that and you sort of grow up into larger and larger transactions as you accumulate more and more Capital the challenges with that model very few people can be good at every stage of the game I think this is what makes um buff and Monger so remarkable is that what Berkshire was 50 years ago and what Berkshire was 40 years ago and 30 years ago and 20 years ago were all very different things from one another you know when I've gotten to speak with those guys about the early days I mean they were deeply involved with their companies they were doing things so differently they were they had a completely different mindset and they matched the mindset and they match their skill set to the situation and the needs that they had at the time which totally makes sense there's just very few people who are that adaptable and are able to be learning on the fly like that over long periods of time you know I would say the the model that we prefer is to to grow out which is you do more deals of similar sizes or in you know sort of a similar range not bigger and bigger deals so as you accumulate Capital you say okay we're used to doing two deals of 10 million dollars a year 20 million dollars total you know sort of capital out the door okay well now we have 50 million dollars a year to put to work um do you do a you know double the size of deals or do you do twice as many deals I'd say is we want to go out not up we really like the area that we're in um you know we we think we've developed an expertise in a very unusual style of company where it's kind of a common link where they're too big to be small but too too small to be big they're like in this adolescent phase of business which I think you um have a lot of fruits it's more volatile to be honest um because obviously you know adolescence as well is volatility um but you know the volatility can be upside volatility as much as downside volatility and so there's real fruit in um helping take a company that maybe doesn't have as isn't good at the business of business as we've talked about and helping them get better at that while they have a really great core expertise in the thing itself that they do so that's the model that we've chosen that doesn't mean we won't get involved in in larger businesses I mean the last check we wrote was um a 40 million dollar check which is that's a big check for us I mean you know it was not too long ago that I was writing million dollar checks and and those seemed like big checks right to to be that large now maybe in 10 years we'll be writing 400 million dollar checks but we really like what regardless of the size of the check we really like to be with companies where we think there are growth opportunities that can come from a skill set or expertise that we can bring to the table I'm in a situation where I'm trying to become a better capital allocator never taken a finance course in my life uh have invested in oh really okay that makes me feel much better about it yeah I mean um yeah is that so that okay wait so you let's let's dive into that you haven't like no formal no education around Finance or anything like that because you seem to be like grooving your way through financial terms and writing checks and so you know well you fooled me well I just because you don't have a formal training and it doesn't I don't think mean you know I I've learned over time I mean I I was not one of these people I can barely open up Excel I didn't work at another firm you know I don't have a I don't have a degree from a a fancy School in in finance I you know I don't have any of the traditional markers you know I often joke that I'm the Forrest Gump of private Equity right um but I've learned along the way right you pick up Concepts just because somebody didn't teach it to you it doesn't mean you can't learn it um you know I've read a lot and um tried to really understand again the first principles of of what people are talking about and oftentimes jargon just covers up a lack of understanding so learned over time but you you said you want to be a better Capital allocator why do you think you're not a good Capital allocator now I said I want to become a better capital allocator and I'm saying that because in in my world I'm seeing a lot of opportunities you know I've done a lot of like seed stage series a technology investing probably invested in 50 companies uh late checkouts invested in probably 30 companies in the last two years some of those have become really big businesses but given what I think is happening in the market I just wanna I just want to become better you know yeah um and I think there's probably a lot of people listening to this that are like wow there's going to be a lot of opportunities that are going to come online and best be prepared so what would you what would you recommend to folks who who want to level up their Capital allocator skills in terms of places to go for that people to read books courses you name it yeah well maybe just firstly we can talk about what does it mean to be a good capital allocator and what does it mean to be a bad Capital allocator so when I think of good Capital allocation um I think of a keen understanding of opportunity cost is where it all really starts so everyone's going to have different opportunity costs opportunity cost means if I choose to do something I can't do something else but choosing to do something means you have access to an opportunity so a dentist in Des Moines is going to have a different opportunity set and different opportunity costs than you will now that doesn't mean yours are better than his or hers it just means that they're different so you got to really understand you know what opportunities do you have access to and why do you have access to them and how do you compare opportunities so this is where again as a series a investor seed stage investor you know you have an opportunity to invest in early stage companies that most people don't have access to so you got to create a rubric around what am I hoping to get out of those and what's the financial model that I'm hoping to to employ there at what expected return that we'll compete with you buying the S P 500 Index Fund competing with buying a house competing with everything else I'm making this up you probably have other opportunities so that that's where you really have to is a good Capital alligator you have to say okay I have to take the capital that I have and then I have to put it to work into some situation which is going to be sub-optimal there's no perfect situations there's no perfect returns there's no risk-free investing so you're you're taking risk and the question is what risk am I taking over what period of time for what expected return and then you just compare them and you say okay this is where Capital allocation becomes an interesting art of assembling a portfolio that maybe zigs and Zags in different scenarios right so if you have only seed stage investments in technology firms that are only in Silicon Valley I'm making this up right there's probably going to be a pretty high correlation between those Investments that may create unbelievable upside and unbelievable downside and depending on your risk tolerance and depending on how you think about holding cash and other Investments you might have that may be fantastic for you or maybe the dumbest thing you could possibly do that's what I'm saying is everyone's different what you have to think about is under what scenarios will it produce what return and what do I need that return for so it'd be really stupid if you said okay look I need to buy a house in two years I've got five million dollars I'm just making up a number um and I'm gonna go put that into early stage seed Investments because typically early stage seed Investments are not going to pay off for 5 10 maybe even 15 years right in terms of when I say pay off I don't mean Mark to Market I mean cash in your bank account that you can go spend on a house so that'd be pretty dumb right I mean if you say that that that's the objective I'm trying to meet is to buy a house in two years for God's sakes don't put it in early stage seed Investments now you could take that same amount of money and say yeah I'm gonna put it in the s p because it's liquid and I feel comfortable taking the risk that the Market's going to go up they're down or whatever it is and I maybe don't need five I need three of that five and I feel comfortable with a you know a sixty percent draw down I'm okay with that I want to take that risk because maybe it's a 60 melt up right um you know conversely somebody else who says okay look I've got five million dollars of cash on hand I've got a great Diversified portfolio of real estate and you know whatever else other you know sources of income maybe a W-2 employee some somewhere I'm good on the cash side I've got this five million dollars and I just want to try to generate the the best return I can possibly generate in that case and you have access to it maybe seed stage Investments are the best possible thing you could do those resources so there's no right or wrong answer it is trying to pair up your needs time Horizon to need and expected return to opportunity cost like what I want to do with you selfishly is just like open up all my books and just be like all right well how would you you know you're you're me you're you're us like what would you do I think like one of the things that is difficult is a lot of capital allocators are in their own world like you might be in your world and I might be able to look at your books and be like hey you actually like there's this whole new set of like community-based businesses or software businesses that are coming up that are going to be at you know this valuation that it might make sense to take you know five percent of your Capital to go and allocate for these reasons but vice versa and I I actually think I can gain a lot more than you potentially can gain but vice versa I think like having that feedback is is super super key and like I feel like Finance is pretty a lot of people keep it to themselves yeah people are funny about money right yeah I mean exactly because money money is money is in in some ways um a tool and in some ways the measuring stick and in some ways the comparison between people and some ways people see it as the judge of their value and so there's all these entanglements with money that have nothing to do with the actual money itself um exactly so yeah I mean and you're right people are in their silos I mean look I I I'll talk transparently about my finances I hold two types of Investments I hold highly illiquid small private Investments right in these companies that we that we've Acquired and cash and that's it like literally I have the the it's the most barbell strategy I've ever seen right now it's important because small private Investments are highly volatile and uh when you have an opportunity you need to be able to have cash on hand to be able to not need any permission to go and do it and so yeah even though I don't earn much on my cash and inflation is sub-optimal you know I think that the opportunity cost of not holding cash is quite high for me and so I don't invest in the stock market I don't invest in bonds I don't typically invest I mean some exceptions in other managers I don't invest in um you know early stage investing I don't invest in any of that stuff I invest in small private highly cash flowing companies and you know take that cash Harvest it and hold it until I want to redeploy it back into that same sector okay so we have a good understanding of what it means to be a good Capital allocator now how does one level up their skills and where could people go to on the Internet or yeah where can they go to learn I'm a big fan of reading older things that have stood the test of time and so if you think about many of the best investors of sort of our generation are steeped in thoughtful things were written quite a while ago and so I would go back and read what I would call the classics right now depends on how you define it and a lot of these by the way are people roll their eyes out and they're like oh everyone's read these well look if you're if you're already at the level where you've read all of the the greats then like why are you taking advice from me you're probably a better investor than I am right like that's fine um but I'm probably going to say the things that that most people who have been in this space have done which is go back and read The Berkshire letters and when I say read the letters like get out of you know print them out put them in a binder and like turn off your phone and go get a pencil or pen out and mark them up and when you come across a concept that you don't understand and I mean you got to really test yourself do I really understand what he's talking about do I understand this concept fully if you don't put your pencil down and go research it Google the [ __ ] out of it right and try to figure out what people are saying about that concept and really try to make the connections between that concept that he's mentioning and maybe your own life or your own investing it takes it's a it's a slow process to really you know it's one thing to to read about something to learn about something really a different thing to understand it have it sort of seep into your uh logic and process systems but I would say the Berkshire letters are an incredible education uh and and like anything else like I mean Buffett's been writing for a long time like the early letters have a lot of the same things the later letters do they've just been repeated in sort of different situations Howard marks is another one that I think very highly of um you know I have not uh I think that that his early letters especially um so these are letters from A chairman of uh oak tree uh Capital seems Howard marks um very famous dead investor um certainly benefited from uh falling interest rates over over basically his entire career but he's just an incredible thinker and a thoughtful guy and and kind and generous and I would I would you know especially as early letters I would read them Book Like The Outsiders will in you know definitely increase your surface area of awareness of a lot of different investing Styles I think that's the key the key is how people do things are very very different people's thoughts on debt people's thoughts on risk tolerance people thoughts on sector on stage of company are all going to be so different what you want to do is you want to go and Sample you know who are the best early stage investors and why are they really good do they just get lucky over and over again or does there some something in the system that they've created right and can you replicate that better replicate part of it or do you even want to replicate part of it that's going to be very different than somebody who's investing in heavy technology or heavy capital expenditure businesses or you know industrial businesses or turnarounds or small companies medium-sized companies large companies public private I mean there's all these different people that are out there you know choosing a very uh Niche thing to invest in I mean there's people who invest only in funding lawsuits right I mean this the the amount of things that you can invest in are almost Limitless I mean there's a guy I know who he's the largest um supplier of debt to the watermelon industry right like you'd never guess that in a million years so there's a lot of these really interesting niches that you can fall into but you got it before you before you choose your sort of off the beaten path thing that you want to go do if that's what you choose to do and become a sort of professional investor in that area you've got to learn what the path is and to study the path is to study the sort of the people have gone before you and have done quite well that's not a good enough place to wrap up I don't know what is um there's a temptation to follow you know the IT person but there's just so much wisdom in in the grades so I think that's and I loved your idea around like okay go spend like two hours every week or an afternoon every week and go read a Berkshire letter grab like a pencil and a highlighter and a notebook and write about it and I think actually what could be fun is also like you know grab a group of people to do it with sure um just do something though don't don't not do it because you can't get the group together yeah you know so I could just go do it and you can be like us who don't have Finance degrees too amen you don't need to finance degree teach yourself it's all on the internet I mean honestly like I owe most of my career to Google I don't I mean I I'm not joking when I say that I mean literally um I called a a local lawyer that I had at the time whenever I had the opportunity to buy my first business it was very I had no capital I took an SBA loan and I said okay so what do we do next and he said well we need a due diligence so I literally typed into Google do diligence due diligence right and then it pops up d-u-e diligence I'm like what is what does it do oh do that's what he meant and then I'm like what are you know are there lists out there and like you start googling lists for due diligence honestly like there's no better way to do it than just to hop in and just try to be humble and learn I appreciate it uh where could people learn from from you well permanentequity.com is our website we have a lot of we've written a lot on there we have a lot of things published um under the resources tab our view on the world and investing and operating and that's probably the best place I mean I'm on Twitter and Linkedin and all the all the places not all the places those are the only two places but um yeah I mean I'm pretty accessible if I can be helpful to anybody feel free to reach out yeah grateful to be on the show thank you thanks foreign [Music]

I heard a story about Tim Ferriss that he designed his blog for billionaires to read it so when asked about hey should we include a pop-up to get email subscribers on the website he said I think about designing my website as if Bill Gates is reading my website because if you think about it like Tim probably has a bunch of billionaires read his stuff so I think it's an interesting framework for thinking about creating a startup which is especially if you're in the B2B space how do you think about crafting an experience for that type of audience

I'm curious about like the business and economics behind rite of passage it scales like it scales very well if you take traditional education at most could only have 40 students and then you're still doing lecture formats and if you look at the science of lecture attention people retain almost nothing now the teacher is also responsible for grading they're also responsible for coming up with the content I have a whole team to help me out I have 38 people who are helping me run this in some capacity I have a full-time team of editors so that every single piece of writing gets editing within 24 hours I have a full-time team of mentors so that whatever it is whether it's the psychology of writing whether it's how to be vulnerable in your writing whether it's how do I distribute my writing whatever it is there's a different Mentor who's gone through the course who does this well who's writing consistently who basically teaches their own mini course within rite of passage then I have a full-time team an operations team because of that we can then provide a bunch more attention that someone in person can provide we're just counter positioning and competing along different vectors

this is this is it Legends uh Dickie Bush former BlackRock employee turned writer Aficionado shipped 30 for 30 co-founder Nicholas Cole uh one of the best World of Warcraft players in the world in North America at least now he's uh an author and also co-founder of 30 for 30. uh welcome to the show so so good to have you what's going on I'd like to be here that's my claim to fame apparently well it was just interesting to me because I I had always known you as the ship 30 for 30 guy and then when I saw that you played Warcraft and you were competitive I thought that was really interesting um I'm curious let's let's just start with that how has being uh professional or competitive esportsgamer helped you you know in your career Dickie probably you probably have a similar answer I feel like all of it can get boiled down to to one thing which is video games increased my threshold for pain I think I think my ability to endure boring tasks on the pursuit to achieve something is like world class I think that is a very difficult skill for a lot of people to just sit in front of your computer and do the boring thing because you want one item upgrade and it's gonna cost you 78 painful hours to get there like that was my whole childhood so now and now you just see that play out and everything like entrepreneurship is literally that all the time and it's funny because Cole and I when we first met didn't know that we had such similar backgrounds but I played professional Call of Duty 4 and before that I played more hours of RuneScape and po like my entire childhood was based on video games I picked up Sports luckily in in high school and we were cool we were like three or four years too early because twitch was not a thing you could not record your screen and cell phones didn't really have high quality video cameras so you couldn't like I remember the idea of having a capture card where you could record your screen to play it back but if if I was like three years younger I never would have played Sports I never would have I would have just become a twitch streamer because that's all I wanted to do was play video games but we're a little bit before our time but I mean my answer is pretty much the same I to this day learned more playing RuneScape about business economies working with the team monotonous work than I learned in college or really anything and I think running an online business is pretty much like playing a video game except you don't stack you know digital gold you can stack real gold and do cool things with it in the real world so it's like at the end of the day one both things you're kind of just clicking buttons for a lot of it but one of them the rewards are a little bit better I mean you're still seeing a number on a screen go up you know whether you're logging into Starcraft or you're logging into chase you know instead of gold it's USD it's it's still kind of the same and I think it's Packy McCormick who calls it the great online game how we're all playing this online game and I think there's something to be said about people who are obsessed with games and people who are really good at the internet would you agree yeah I mean I think one of the most surprising things for me is how many times when I share that little tidbit you know I was a really competitive World of Warcraft player as a teenager a lot of people respond with oh so was I in XYZ situation I'll never forget I moved to LA in 20 17 and I found myself at this big fancy dinner up in the hills and all these really accomplished people there Lady Gaga's designers there like just all these random really successful people and we're having this dinner and we all were going around introducing ourselves and the guy who hosted the dinner shared that tidbit about me and the guy opposite me who had built a massive Ad Agency turns to me and goes oh no way I was the guild leader of one of the biggest guilds in World of Warcraft of all time and like that happens constantly in the entrepreneurship world it's like the background in gaming clearly primes your brain for certain skills for certain ways of thinking for a certain threshold of pain for strategy for learning rules then bending rules you know it's like video games Prime all of that I think you could almost go like a level above that and say it's not even video games but it's just obsessive personalities and for young kids there's not very many ways to direct that obsessive personality other than video games and maybe music right because you don't have enough autonomy and so I think it's more rather than video games have just been a vehicle to apply that obsessive personality and then you get into the real world it's like oh I can take this and apply it to solving problems as an entrepreneur like of course I'm going to choose that path and growing up I always thought my obsessive personality was kind of a bug rather than a feature because I think school other parents Society in general discourages that kind of like Obsession or intensity where I'd pick up a new thing and I'd only do that for months and get as good as it as I could quickly and I I always say my parents will let me do whatever I wanted like if I wanted to play 15 hours of video games I could as long as I was doing well in school where a lot of other parents wouldn't let their kids obsess over anything right instead they would just let them they they wanted them so well-rounded where they didn't end up building any kind of real you know obsessive skill and so they get in the real world and that is rewarded by working for just a company or a regular corporate job I think so you both now obsess about building audiences and writing on the internet why why obsess over that Dickey I'll let you field that one first mine was a way of exploring opportunities and so my background of working on Wall Street I started in 2018 right when I graduated college and realized like a year in that that wasn't the path that I was going to take forever I looked around and saw guys in their early 30s in one specific example uh asked his boss to go to his son's Little League game and his boss said no and that was about a year in and I knew that I wasn't going to stick I was not going to be able to work for someone else for a long time but rather than just quit I said how what's an easy way to explore opportunities and it was just putting myself out there and becoming easy to find right so for me I started doing that with just a newsletter and that's how I met col all the time that you at time at 95 of the people that I talked to on a weekly basis now and so the goal of ship 30 is to help as many people experience that as possible right or maybe they're I love this idea of the internet democratizing access to Friendship where if you grew up and you were this goes back to what we were saying of being obsessed with certain things and you didn't have a way of meeting other people that were obsessed in the same thing as you thought you were the odd one out but the internet has made it where I I would have loved to have had a blog or something writing on Twitter wherever as a younger person because I would have found so many more like-minded people along the way and so that's why I'm writing to this day is I'm still continuing to meet cool people and all that compounds over time so if I can help as many people as possible unlock their creative writing ability which then goes to unlock new opportunities like that sounds like an awesome mission to kind of build around and that's our goal our mission to help a million people start doing it because we know if we help a million people start writing the number of new connections and opportunities and education that will come from that is is huge so the Nuance I think that is worth pointing out because there's there's so much talk around how do you build an audience benefits of building an audience we all understand it but I think what gets lost is it really is not about the size of the audience it's not about the number and and a perfect example is Dicky and Maya's relationship when we got connected you know I've been doing this for a long time I've been writing on the internet for a really long time and I've gone through multiple platforms and multiple cycles and multiple you see people rise and then they get burned out and new classes of creators and new like I've been doing this for over a decade like it's just same patterns over and over again and when Dicky and I got connected I remember what's the first thing I did I clicked on his Twitter profile because I was like who's this guy I just got connected to we got connected in a cold email through a mutual friend I clicked on his Twitter profile dick he probably had I don't remember 800 followers right but when I started to look what I saw Beyond just how big is your audience what I saw were good habits I saw someone who was actively writing on the internet I saw someone who was trying to share things that were interesting to them and valuable to other readers and because I've been doing this for so long I could see that data point projected out into the future and go Dicky has 800 followers today he's gonna lap everybody because I just know I have that pattern recognition and so the the thing for me is it's not actually about building an audience what it is is it's about understanding it's what you said about [ __ ] and the great online game we are all playing the game whether we realize it or not consciously unconsciously when you meet someone what's the first thing you do you look them up on the internet and what you find dictates how you perceive that person we're all playing it but everyone's focus is on the follower count and really that's like one small data point in the whole game it's really about is this person playing are they playing consciously or unconsciously are they putting things out there that are valuable a thousand followers or a hundred thousand followers when you click on their stuff are you interested there's a lot of people I know with half a million followers where I'm like you write really not interesting things there's a lot of people with a thousand followers I click on and I go wow this is brilliant I want to sink my teeth into it right so it's like going beyond the benefit of building an audience and more of the are you playing the game consciously such that it unlocks new opportunities for your life I'm a audience maximalist like building an audience maximalist and I think everyone should do it you know I hear often from people who don't write on the Internet or who don't who don't have a conscious effort of creating an audience I ask them like hey why are you not writing on Twitter and they they say I don't want to be cringe I feel like there's just growing cringiness Vibe that's going around that's holding people back from participating if someone thinks that they're thinking they're far more important and that people are paying way more attention to them than they actually are and so it's I don't want to be cringe behind that has this assumption that when I put something out everyone that I know is going to read it they're going to study every word of it they're going to judge me but the truth is most people are way way way too caught up in themselves and so the only reason someone would be quote unquote scared to be cringe if that is if they're sitting on the other side not writing and just judging everyone that they see right so it's I'm worried I'm going to look cringe because I'm sitting here reading all these people and I'm like oh that's cringe that's cringe but at the end of the day they're putting themselves out there they're unlocking opportunities and you're the one paying with your attention by reading it right so rather than have this fear of like oh I don't want people to think I'm cringe it's why don't you just try putting yourself out there and recognize where it uh where it tips is they're so scared to look cringe and then suddenly they're upset that no one's reading in any of their stuff when they get started and so it's the opposite side of the coin right they don't look cringe they they just don't look like anything because the truth is no one reads any of the things you put out in the beginning so you just kind of have to get started yeah I totally agree with all that and Greg I would say I'm an audience maximalist too it was the first thing I realized as a 17 year old on the internet I was like if you have an audience you get more stuff period I thought you were gonna say your cringe that's what I thought you I thought you were gonna come out and be like I'm really cringe guys I'm really cringe and I'm I'm putting it out there look I don't think anyone disagrees with the statement if you have an audience you get more opportunities period right yes but but the Nuance what gets missed is it's the same as waking up every day and going I want to be rich there isn't anyone on Earth that if you gave them the option to be rich tomorrow would say no right but if all you did was walk around and say I just want to be rich you'd be cringe just like if you say I just want to build an audience it's a little cringe but the reason it's cringe is because what you're talking about is I want the outcome without caring about the process that's what you're saying and so the issue is when people go all this focus on audience audience audience audience is an outcome it's an outcome of what of learning of helping people of sharing things that are valuable so the cringe part is someone going I just care about the number not I care about helping someone because the moment someone goes I really care about educating these people I really care about solving these problems or I really care about no one's going to look at them and be like that's stupid right so it's all it's this over rotation on I want the outcome without carrying and being connected to the process yeah where the where this is coming from is I have a friend uh his name is Daniel singer and I saw his Twitter bio recently and his Twitter bio is Imagine taking Twitter seriously and I feel like there's this growing class of people who are like him where they they don't want to look like they don't want to do threads for example because threads are cringe even though we know threads work all right when I used to play World of Warcraft I was very good at the game very very good at the game and I would dual other players or we would complete against their arena team or we would play them in Battlegrounds and just crush them do you know what they would say back afterwards imagine taking this game seriously um that's that's what you say when you don't know how to play the game so when someone sits there and goes I'm upset that I'm not winning what they do is they point and they criticize everybody and go you're cringe imagine taking that seriously lucky and it's like all you're doing is just admitting that you don't know how to play the game that's all you're doing so whenever so even the fact that we're talking about this it's like we're basically debating why the people who don't know how to play the game don't want to play the game are like saying that it's a bad game I Dicky and I are too busy trying to help other people play the game you know yeah why give it attention I mean I don't want to put words in Daniel's mouth but people like him they might look at you know playing the game as like oh I don't need to play the game I don't need to play the game because I'm already a founder of a company that's doing really well and I'm I need a you know spend all my time focusing on you know solutions to problems building my team raising Venture Capital but that's a different game that's a different game and and what ghostwriting taught me is there is a drastic difference between doing something and being really good at explaining how to do it and so a lot of times when I would go straight for a Founder they'd be accomplished but then when I asked them can you explain how you solve these problems they can't articulate it right so they got good at doing it but they didn't build the skill of being able to articulate it and so what a lot of times right what does that person do they go oh the people over there articulating it super cringe no you're probably just mad that that's a game that you're not winning that's a game that you're not playing right just like think of the other side there's all the people that go imagine taking your startup seriously it's just the other side criticizing the other game right it's everybody in their own vacuum criticizing the other vacuum and it's like these are all just Niche games just play the game that you want to play and let other people play their games is there any truth to cringiness Twitter of course I just want you to say it I want you to say it like tell me you know tell me how you feel about that and do you think the people that are writing you know the you know Twitter is a top university you know the top you know these threads that we always see that are basically repurposed time and time again when you see those threads like what do you think you know as professionals do you are you like wow they're just playing the game or are you like I think they should be playing another game I think it's a way of playing the game is that the optimal way depends what game you're playing if their goal is to play the dopamine slot machine that we've all played and we all do with Twitter and write a thread that gets 50 000 likes but every person who reads it has no interest in following you along as a reader sure right if you only write threads about Google Docs and you know Chrome extensions you you're not building any kind of personal relationship but it's okay if you choose to play that game you can do it successfully you're going to get a lot of followers now if the goal of the game is maximum number of followers sure but I don't think that's a very smart goal to have for the game right because if you have 200 000 followers and you've never sold anything what is that going to do and none of them they all followed you one time for one thing and then the next thing you write they're like I've known why did I follow this person again they don't remember anything you wrote from a personal perspective versus when you're telling your stories or providing educational content right look I've written threads on Google Docs and on TED talks and on YouTube videos and they've worked but it's all about you don't build your entire life around that but again I I don't think it's it's not worth spending time like judging the people playing that game right instead you should just play your own game and say they are playing theirs I'm gonna play mine and rather than give them the mental headspace of like oh my gosh I I can't imagine riding a thread like that it's like why don't you just focus a little bit more on on what you're doing rather than kind of what other people are doing my take on it is I respect games in general as a game player I respect games putting it out there you know do I think the the best way to get your name out there is to essentially copy formats like copy a thread that's worked for example this you know the one that we've all seen around you know Twitter is better than 99.9 of universities and just kind of like copy and pasting I don't think it's a great approach that being said like someone like Blake Burge who authentically writes threads on Excel and Google Sheets and creates new new content you know in the game format like in Threads you know not only is he able to like build an audience of 400 000 people in like two years which is wild he's also able to like you know he quit his job he's like living on like a farming Community like his dream with like 1500 other people he's selling like Google Sheets and other digital assets and making me a great living from it like when you hear stories like that it just like gives you the warm and fuzzy feeling yeah Blake was uh got his start in Chip 30. he's won a ship 30's biggest success story so the first course he took was ship 30. and oh the number of pieces that he's written to get to where he is he's talked about a ton of different things and then he said wow people like when I write about Excel and there's just no world where someone who's living an awesome life now because of riding on the internet looks around and is like you know what I'm really worried that like this group of VCS thinks I'm cringe like that does not go through his head one time he's like I'm making a living living my dream life I got to quit my corporate job like all these things because I wrote about something that I had experience in that sounds like an absolute dream to me so it's all perspective right and most people just think they're too smart or too cool and it's all a place of ego if you look around at other people doing things on Twitter like oh and you're just judging them so I'm always kind of of the perspective from Jim Detmer that's if you spot it you got it which means the way you kind of think about other people and how you project on them is always projecting from the way you feel about yourself or whatever it is you're doing so I don't know I I don't spend any time judging other people and how they're living their life like you look at some of these people on Twitter who have their entire thing on Twitter has become making fun of people writing on Twitter but all they're doing now is trying to get likes on Twitter the same way the other person is doing they're just appealing to a different group of people right so it's like you're you're playing the same game you just don't recognize it and for some reason think you're more important or smarter or whatever just being a professional [ __ ] poster and and it's negative yeah why would you want to live your life like that like waking up like you know what I'm gonna go generate internet clicks today by being mean imagine waking up with that like predisposition it just sounds like a horrible life so I always I look at those people from a extreme place of empathy like man I'm very glad that that is not how I wake up and choose to to live a lot of people ask me Greg how do you build products that Foster Community well I've got good news that's exactly what late checkout does my company we partner with the largest brands in the world and fast-paced startups to design products that resonate with your community we add a couple interesting clients every single year so if you're interested and that sounds like you email front desk at latecheckout.studio with what you're working on what you need help with and don't forget to mention the where it happens pod thank you [Music] so if you're listening to this and you wanna double down on on writing you know what do you recommend the first steps are so for example I didn't know that Blake basically wrote about a bunch of things and then narrowed in on Excel and Google Sheets like to me he was just always the Excel guy so this happens with anything right writing is just it's a vehicle but this is true for wanting to improve or get better at anything in life when you first start trying to learn how to do anything you are operating from a lot of assumptions you're operating from the assumption that you'll enjoy it you're operating from the assumption that you know what you want to do with it you're operating from the assumption that you have the patience to get through the first three steps you know and so a big focus of ship 30 and why we've constructed it as a writing challenge is because the goal is to accelerate essentially two years three years five years of learning into 30 days and so for example one of the biggest assumptions that someone makes at the beginning of deciding I want to start writing is they assume they know what they want to write about so you walk into the whole thing and you go I want to write about productivity and then you write about it for three days and you realize that's not actually what I want to write about and part of the learning process is accelerating through those moments so that you can figure out is this what you actually want to write about or no and then the other side is is this what people find valuable right so you write about productivity for five days in a row 10 days in a row and like very lukewarm and then you go and tell the story of how you explored Machu Picchu and what it taught you about living a fulfilling life and it goes viral right and all of a sudden you go oh now I have a data point oh something about that topic is really resonating the thing I thought people wanted isn't actually the thing that people want and so a huge part of the process this is why we have this saying you can't steer a stationary ship what a lot of people do is they sit in their room they sit at their desk they draw out this huge map they go before I take one single step here's my path to a giant successful career on the internet where no one will judge me and everything I do is perfect and I will build a giant audience right and then they take one step and they have to confront all these assumptions and instead a much better approach is to just begin write about a lot of different things see how you feel about it see how it feels for the reader is it something they're enjoying is it something you're enjoying and you navigate as you go along that's the whole idea what do you think about you know writing as Greg Eisenberg versus writing as at the community guy there's this growing Trend around people picking Anonymous unanimous accounts um you know I follow this guy named at the car dealership guy tweets about like cars and stuff like that and where the prices are going and yeah I'm just curious how how you think about that there's definitely an interesting trend on person or anonymous but I think there's two really important things to point out here one is either way it's a person the community guy the community gal the community whatever right which is very different than at Avis Rental Car right it's very there's a difference between a entity and a person whether the person is their name or Anonymous point point a and I think we always want to listen to people more than we want to listen to entities the second though which I find really ironic is this idea of I'm the community guy I'm the product gal I'm the whatever right and it's important to understand what are they doing they are literally naming their niche right which is the whole thing the whole thing is not for you it's not it's not for Dicky to be famous it's not for me to be famous it's not for Greg to be famous it's for each one of us to become known for a niche that we own it's it's to be known for a category of thing so whenever someone goes oh I'm the community person or I'm the product designer person what they're trying to do is they're trying to Signal their Niche so that it's uh it's easy to understand why do you pay attention to me that's the whole point so it sounds like if you want to double down on writing step one is picking a topic step two is picking a niche is step three pick a personality step three is right every day for a year and then pick your head up and see if it worked like see who you are but seriously because you're gonna learn it so much about what you like to write about what people like to read and so where most people will go is okay this sounds great sounds like I can pick a niche and then I'm gonna go spend the next six months creating the perfect website the perfect Blog the perfect content plan I'm gonna have it all mapped out rather than just hitting publish on something tomorrow and so that's why we say this idea of shipping daily you have to be putting ideas out for a year and if you commit to writing about one thing for an entire year you're gonna get really good at that thing and you're going to build distribution around it where right now I'm not talking about writing quite as much as I did in 2020 and 2021 now I'm talking about things that I'm more well not well-rounded but a more diverse list of topics but the only reason people are paying attention to that is because I talked about a singular thing pretty much every single day for a year and a half and Jack butcher has a great quote it's Bill distribution and then build whatever you want and so if I had only written about what I'm writing about now people would have come to me and they wouldn't have built any kind of relationship with me because it was harder to latch on versus when you say hey I'm going to help you solve this one specific problem it's much easier to start with a niche and then expand than to think oh but I have so many interests you just need to pick one and extend the time Horizon and say I'm gonna write on the internet for 20 years I don't have to figure it all out right now I can pick one thing and write about it for three and then pick another thing right about it first I think too many people and myself included when I was getting started felt like I had to have it all figured out right away rather than recognizing this was going to be a long-term game and that the only thing I needed to do is get started and the rest kind of takes care of itself when you're putting out enough data getting feedback all that I I've been seeing you tweet more lifestyle content really you know I saw you tweet there is simply no better way to prepare for the week ahead than steak eggs potatoes and spinach and then you took a a picture of your steak and eggs and potatoes and spinach and first of all it looked amazing like I don't know what you put in your eggs but sign me up and second of all I feel like if you can post about steak and eggs you've made it in in the sense of like as a writer or as a content creator when you're able to create lifestyle content where you're basically for me as a content creator I think about like how do I build audience first and then build Affinity second so Affinity is another word for trust I want to increase that amount of trust and I feel like lifestyle content a lot of the time makes people feel more connected to the Creator is that something that you're consciously doing well the mistake I made when I just started out was thinking I could only talk about lifestyle content and I was going to grow because the truth was no one they they come for some specific problem you're solving for them and then they build a relationship with you based on the tangential things you talk about not the reverse right if I had only tweeted out pictures of my steak and eggs I'd have a hundred followers and that was it right but instead I've helped so many people solve problems in their life through my writing that now I can tweet about just things I'm generally interested in and they've come to trust me as a person so it's the dream of course is where you just live your life on a day-to-day basis and your writing is a byproduct of exploring your unique interests and then all the readers are reading anything you put out just because they're interested in you but that I'm still not at that point and still Focus most of my writing on solving problems but like I think the long-term sustainable way to write has to be things that you're extremely interested in learning and continuing to grow rather than only talking about one thing forever but I do think you have to start there because otherwise you're not going to generate any kind of it's like the cold start problem you can't talk about things that interest everyone in the beginning because someone would come to your profile and say I don't know what I'm here for but now it's like you build up enough of a general readership then you can kind of talk about anything I I essentially agree the the thing with this topic is it is such a nuanced thing right I think it's so easy to just go you get famous and then you can do whatever but everything sits inside a context right the context is the niche that you are creating Within so why is Dickies posting steak and eggs interesting well let's follow the logic line the logic line is I reader follow Dicky because I want to start writing online next Point Dicky treats writing online like an athlete writes about that next logic line Dicky must structure his life in a very disciplined way in order to treat writing online like an athlete such that I can learn how to write online right fourth logic Point Dickie posts steak and eggs for breakfast that's kind of interesting maybe I should start eating steak and eggs for breakfast so that I can treat my writing like a sport so that I can get better at writing right that's literally what's going through the reader's head and so I think there's a huge logical fallacy where you you look at all these big creators I've watched a dozen Cycles this is exactly what happens writer starts Creator starts experiments gains traction doubles down on a niche becomes known for a niche they own thinks that everyone's following them for them not the niche abandons the niche and then loses engagement over time every over and over it's just the same Loop and it's our human nature to think we are special the reader cares about me Cole the reader cares about Dickie the reader cares about you Greg and in actuality what the reader cares about is you in the context of the niche that solves a problem for them and the moment you step out of that niche completely and you start thinking it's just about you and how special you are and how famous you are and how big your audience is the great dissension begins and just it happens over and over and over again if Ryan holiday tomorrow publishes a book in his Niche stoicism it's a it's a number one bestseller well if Ryan holiday tomorrow publishes a book outside that Niche very very different result I mean Ryan holiday didn't start off as like some well-known stoic like I've known Ryan no he built it I met Ryan when he was the director of marketing at American Apparel I'm super familiar with this whole story right but what happened starts marketing a little bit of traction doubles down second book does okay ghost experiments with a different data point obstacle is the way very successful doubles down doubles down doubles down now category King stoicism if tomorrow Ryan starts only making YouTube videos about his life his breakfasts and his farm animals whole thing goes like this the crazy the crazy thing about the rise of Ryan holiday is that Ryan holiday is more famous than Marcus Aurelius and Seneca to most people today because yeah he's the one who's delivering the mess the message about stoicism in a way that people can understand nowadays uh via Tick Tock via Twitter via Instagram via his books I think what's really courageous that Ryan did was he had a really good thing going with marketing and PR and he said to himself and his editors or whatever like I'm going to go and he picked stoicism when stoicism was like not a real category basically a hundred percent because the mistake would have been him going into Tim ferriss's category and going I'm going to compete with Tim Ferriss losers game right most people I I've studied the [ __ ] out of his story because I think it's fascinating and most people don't realize that his mentor is Robert Greene what did Robert Greene do right he went and did the same thing with all the Machiavellian stuff and Mastery and War and all that right so Ryan holiday takes the blueprint does it with a new category and evangelizes it but the point the point is Ryan holiday is famous because of how he's built stoicism Ryan holiday is not famous because he posts lifestyle content and so lifestyle can be woven in sure it's cool to see what someone that you learn and study from and enjoy follow it's cool to see what they're doing but you are not what matters to the reader unless you're Kim Kardashian right you are not what matters what matters is the the category are they interested in the niche does your Niche solve a problem for them if so your value sits in that niche and the moment that that context changes the way that the reader The Listener the viewer changes the way they see you does the chase ever end like should should Ryan holiday be thinking about what's next in a new category or is this it for him his choice right I mean but anyone who starts to experience it Dicky and I are experiencing it right now you've you've experienced it with Community the moment you start unlocking rewards in a niche the moment you realize oh like dick and I aren't the category Kings of all writing it's just one very specific subcategory start writing that's it you want to go learn how to write a Pulitzer Prize winning novel you go somewhere else if you want to learn how to start writing on the internet this period done we win right here and once you start unlocking rewards in a niche you realize that the switching cost goes up right so the more that you dominate a niche at this point if Ryan holiday went to his publisher and went I'm doing a hard pivot pivoting out of stoicism that's like a code red publisher calls in 12 people being like we've got a serious problem on our hands right because there's a huge switching cost and so can you do it yes do people do it all the time but does it take time and do you have to go through then a whole reorienting of who's interested and who's not a hundred percent because you're not what's special the niche is what's special the earth-shattering moment of what you said was you're not focused on writing you're focused on the sub niche of start writing which Yes sounds so small it sounds like yep start writing that's like other people are gonna do it you know other people are going to own that and it's so small like why you can't build a business around that why would you why would you think so small that's what you know goes through people's brains but you guys are making millions of dollars on the start writing piece and I also think that what enough people don't talk about is you could move adjacent to adjacent categories once you own the category you lead the category yeah what's what's the next logical step start copywriting right start email writing put the word start in front of anything I remember Dickie and I had a whole conversation I remember it was a year and a half ago and it was like a light bulb moment it was like this is all we have to do all we have to do is educate people on start that's it and most creators would be smart to do the same thing for their business right is is it's not just the topic it's where in the journey are you and what's the biggest funnel where do you create the most demand it's all the people who haven't started yet beginning right so take any Niche any category anything web3 get more specific Start web3 Community get more specifics start a community and if all you did as Dicky and I are learning if all you did was drill into that for three years you would realize that you have more work to do not less because the more specific you get the more problems you uncover the more people you realize you can help the larger the demand creation opportunity right it's a great it's a great like Golden Rule is whenever someone thinks something is too specific that's usually the signal that that's where the gold mine is it's funny because start writing sounds small Until you realize that the total addressable Market is everyone who has not started writing which is anyone who's not writing and there's not that many people writing so it sounds small but you go oh wow the the layer zero is everyone on the other side of that and so in whatever Niche it is most potential customers will be in getting started you don't have to choose that way like there's a lot of B2B businesses who only help people who are at five million dollars a year to get to 20. or something like that right or you have to have this number of followers or that like it choosing where to help people based on their level of experience is totally up to you but we went with beginners and why did we go with beginners in the very beginning I was such a beginner that I had no ability to write very well but what I was really good at was building a writing habit like ship 30 before Cole and I even got together wasn't even like start writing online it was like build a writing habit because I had no ex Cole has been writing since 2014 and so when we partnered it was like okay this is how you get the ideas that were in Cole's book into the whole world right but before start writing online it was just build a daily writing habit because I had no experience or ability to teach anything like that so it was even more Niche to start like you don't even have to put your ideas out there it's just how do you start writing every day so I think the more specific you can get on level of experience all it does is make people it forces people to make a choice whether or not they want to start or not whether or not they're at that level of experience where they qualify for it one of the most interesting things that you guys do is not only running an education business you're running a SAS technology company called typeshare I just went to the website obviously that the the first thing I see is everything you need to and this is like you know in red versus everything in Black everything you need to start writing online and they're emphasizing start uh shocker um why did you decide to start a SAS business and what are your hopes for it well I think it's worth recognizing that uh Dicky and I didn't start typeshare um typeshare's original founder is Sam Shore um he built basically the first version of it on his own uh maybe after like two or three cohorts of ship 30 was very early and we saw him do this on Twitter and were like wow this is really cool and reached out and basically said hey if you're gonna build this you know as an indie developer why don't we partner up we'll bring all the customers and you continue to build the platform will will obviously help build the platform because we know how we can turn our education into SAS um and let's just create a separate company so we did we created a separate company and me Dicky and Sam are co-founders in that company and it basically plugs into ship 30. and so the idea is right you take ship 30 and then everyone in ship 30 is basically getting educated on how to use the SAS platform thereafter and I remember Greg the first time I explained that to you your brain just exploded you were like that is genius um and yeah I mean I think an honest answer is we'll see where it goes you know I mean Dicky and I neither of us have done SAS companies before there's a huge learning curve it's very very different than education um ship 30 and typeshare is a really they complement each other well and I think the key is if you're gonna build things if you're gonna build multiple things they have to work together right because if they don't work together then there's no compounding it's just you're signing yourself up for more work elsewhere but because ship 30 is basically the lead gen for typeshare you can rationalize spending time on both because both benefit each other typeshare benefits ship 30 retention and ship 30 benefits typeshare customer acquisition right so you almost think of it just like two different departments in the same company almost and both are extremely lean teams where Cole and I have been patient in hiring so we have one or really a handful of employees but one core and an assistant would ship 30 and then Sam is the lead developer and we have a contractor developer on working on it with him we don't have these big teams we haven't raised any money and this all goes back to which game do we want to play could we go raise a big round for typeshare and hire a bunch of Engineers and accelerate that process probably but that sounds like signing up for a little bit of a job again which I'm not sure we want to do and could we scale ship 30 to Triple what it is now if we went and hired a bunch of people right away maybe but it's also a lot of fun to operate with a very small team and probably at the expense of growth and pursuing different opportunities and so we're extending the time Horizon and saying yeah we'll get to that and we'll get to that and we'll get to that and it's very freeing to run a business that way where it's yes this is working now despite not doing this not doing that not starting that thing not starting that thing and so rather than look at it as like oh we could be doing way more it's like we will do way more we just expand extend the time Horizon with which we do all those and we're going to be able to grow forever because of it there's this trend right now about so solopreneurship ever you know so many people want to be solopreneurs businesses of one you know preview and the previous cycle it was I want to raise as much money as possible I want a business of a million um I saw a term recently called micro entrepreneurs which I which I found interesting which is hmm sort of in between I want to swing for the fences and I wanna live in the forest by myself uh not have contact with anyone but also have a business type thing and micro entrepreneurs is like you know the 5 10 15 20 person business that's profitable that is highly leveraged that relies on audiences and I think we're gonna see a huge surge in micro entrepreneurship and that's a great example of like who is owning that category like why doesn't someone go and like put a stake there like if Justin Welsh is the solopreneurship guy and is making seven figures a year and has an incredible audience you know someone could easily be that uh Justin Welsh but for micro entrepreneurs I think Michael Kondra Capra I can't pronounce his last name but he tweeted it solopreneurs are one person teams micropreneurs are like 10 person teams I sent that tweet to him via DM I was like I love this language and this was a couple days ago because I think that is where people are headed because in solopreneurship you quickly realize like you basically have a glorified job for a lot of it because you're doing everything so why wouldn't you potentially want to zoom out and have a little bit of a team where you're able to not the thing about solopreneurship is you can't stop doing all the things you're doing without your livelihood being completely at risk not that we would ever stop doing anything but I think it's worth recognizing whether you have a glorified job or a business and solopreneurship to me is you just are working for yourself versus running a business and it's interesting the thing about all the different ways we could educate on how we do things as a team call on that front but that to me sounds way more fun to to have a 10 person team a lot of autonomy you really know the people you're working with you enjoy working with them I I totally agree and I raised a small round for my first company and we were thinking of doing the whole VC route and I took all these meetings and you know kind of projected it all forward and I think I and a lot of entrepreneurs have woken up and are waking up to the realization that every time you raise more money your success chances go down not up that's that's the big aha is that every time you you move the goal post your the chances of you actually having a meaningful outcome go from you know twenty percent to ten percent to five percent to one percent to half of one percent to and when you start to net it out you realize it is significantly easier to make a million dollars a year than it is to have an exit that pays you one to ten million dollars and then when you have that exit well now your cash machine is gone so now you have to go do it again right and so I think it's different games for different people I know some entrepreneurs who play this play the VC game exceedingly well and they've made fortunes doing it but I think it's very easy to look at it and go that's easy and it's not and you have way higher chances creating Financial abundance for yourself putting yourself in positions of power and leverage and an opportunity by building a one to three to five million dollar business or being a solopreneur making half a million or a million bucks a year you have so many more freedoms so many a lot of which aren't Financial right the freedom to just wake up when you want to wake up to go for walks with your significant other you know I think the post covid World revealed to a lot of people like hey I'd rather trade my 600k salary for a 300K salary if it means I have my sanity right there's a lot to be said for that the biggest takeaway I have from this conversation is it's not the great online game we're playing it's the great online games that we're playing and it's about how do you think about which games do I want to play in life and then work and being creating systems to basically go after those games that's like that's my takeaway gents always a pleasure if people want to learn more about chip 30 and and you guys where can they do it I think the easiest place to go is start writingonline.com you can download our free 13 000 word Ultimate Guide to start writing like we talked about it's got everything you need to write on any platform it's all our best Frameworks just give it away so start writingonline.com and then ship3430.com if you want to check out the course uh next cohorts in April and if you're listening to this later I have co-works running all the time and if you're looking to get started like we talked about no better place and I'm at Dickie Bush on Twitter LinkedIn spend way too much time on both those so that's where you can find me epic thanks so much guys for coming on you're gonna have to come back on again and by the way I'm drinking a non-alcoholic beer if you're watching this on YouTube I saw that Dickie was coming on to this and Dickie doesn't drink and uh I open the fridge and I was inspired by Dicky and I was like you know I'm gonna have a non-alcoholic drink so cheers [Music]

the theory of memic Desire is single-handedly one of the greatest tools to create a big business a philosopher named Renee Girard researched led to a thesis that as consumers we really don't know what we want so we imitate what other people want and desire basically the key Insight here is that human desire is not an autonomous process but it's a collective one we want things because other people want them if you buy a Nike hat I'm more likely to buy a Nike hat if I trust you then it makes sense that creating communities creating internet-based communities creating physical communities is the key to unlocking this idea of memic Desire if you first start with the community and then you layer on products to sell that will increase the idea and the flywheel of Rene Gerard's memic desire

all right so Lavinia I actually just want to catch up with you to be honest and before we started this call you were saying how excited you are for 2023 why are you excited yeah I mean I I love change uh and you know there's a great book by Naseem taleb anti-fragile which kind of goes into this concept of you know there are certain things that get more resilient as as you shake them up and then there are other things that completely break right there's sort of fragile things and anti-fragile and anti-fragile is kind of this interesting concept because it's not just like it doesn't get worse you know at a at a it's sort of you know better at staying good no it actually improves in chaotic kind of environments right so like Evolution you know things like that um the human body the human brain like these adaptive systems um and I just really try to run gumroad my Venture stuff like everything that I do in a very anti-fragile way where basically everything can kind of go to zero um and I will outperform the competition in that way um and so I'm just anytime there's like any real risk or change in the environment ecosystem whether that's covid leaving covid whatever it is I'm I just I get super psyched um it's frustrating I think the last two years have been frustrating for for for people like me who like to build stuff because they're just you weren't you weren't really rewarded as much for that uh and I think this year next year it's gonna hopefully it'll be it'll be much more valuable to to actually build valuable things right um and I'm confident that I know how to do that uh and so that's kind of why I'm excited is I guess you know like the tides The Tide is very quickly going out uh and I have no concerns about that you know uh so I'm I'm excited do you think there's going to be more Builders now or less Builders they'll definitely be less less Builders um as a percent it'll go up right because you're gonna see tons of people who who don't identify as Builders leaving the ecosystem I consider these people like tourists basically who got in when it was like really sexy um but like are gone already frankly right uh they've pieced out like in January of this year the first couple quarters uh but I think I think even the Builder Persona is is going to shrink too right where there are lots of people and the reason is because Builders are also relatively rational people and and sort of factor in Risk quite significantly most Builders are not risk seeking at all right so when you look at Founders like the founder personality type you have to Overlay so many things that are like in the minority uh to get someone like a Patrick Olson or a Dylan field or Mark Zuckerberg or an Elon Musk or whatever right you have to over like quite a few things and and so I think a lot of Builders who are not you know who are doing the math for example and saying hey Robin Hood being 80 billion makes me want to start a company but Robinhood being worth 4 billion doesn't make me want to start a company there are a lot of people that that make those kinds of decisions and will say Hey you know I'm actually going to go work at Amazon or Facebook or Google instead also like Robin Hood being worth 4 billion but having 4 billion on cash on hand right and to me I mean to be honest like it's irrelevant I really don't care like I did not build stuff because there was money to be had in building stuff like when I started making iPhone apps when I was like 15 years old this was before you know Instagram and snap and Uber even like one of the first things I built was like an Uber basically call a cab on your phone app but I just did it to solve my own problem like I didn't think about it like oh wow there's like we can completely reinvent Transportation or something like that right and so for me it's like cool like Engineers are cheaper they're easier to hire um designers are cheaper easier to hire uh and that's all I need I don't actually don't need anything else um those are the two most valuable you know resources on the planet uh and now they're you know they're sort of two to three times cheaper than they were like six months ago which is amazing you know I would say the only other thing to crash the only other thing I'm super excited about is to hope that is I hope interest rates continue to climb and I hope that stock prices continue to get crushed I hope that housing uh gets destroyed completely you know like I would love to be able to buy a house in San Francisco you know for 200 000 and I think that's possible um but it's going to take you know 10 plus percent interest rates so that's what I want like fingers crossed um we'll see what happens and where are you spending a lot of your brain power think you know thinking about you you know either particular Industries or ideas that you can share that you know are on your mind yeah I mean obvious you know the big one that everyone's talking about these days is AI right um so I think that's that's that's pretty interesting um I don't think it's as notable as people it's I don't think it's a step function increase for example I think we've been basically seeing this gradual thing happening which is we take work that is valuable but it wrote and automate it and we've been doing this for a long period of time like I would say the largest example of this is open source software right so I can build a new product that really to build the product it's hundreds of thousands of lines of code uh but I only have to write two to three hundred lines of code right because I'm able to basically like abstract away all of the complexity to you know open source software and so I think AI is just basically like that but for like language that is just much more probabilistic and less deterministic right language is not as it's not math right it's it's it's it's actually like there's it is relative right when you learn a language you're kind of learning how all the words connect to each other but there's like nothing outside of it which is like super strange right you don't learn from like a base level of knowledge and build up you kind of piece things together like a puzzle um which makes no sense like the reason that that works is because we humans came up with it right nature didn't come up with it uh so it's not great um but yeah I I just look at basically all of these different kinds of jobs basically any job in which your output is digital um you know I I see that that that will kind of be replaced with basically a computer predicting what that human would be outputting um and I think a lot of my brain power right now is spent on basically reading up on these papers uh like right now I'm reading a paper on it's called fusions it's called fusions of Consciousness I think just came out today um but basically we're learning a lot of stuff about Neuroscience about the brain about intelligence about neurons and how they work and you know it's sort of the last problem because if you can figure that out then like you you know it's kind of like what Google says like you figure out how to solve the information problem and then you can solve every other problem with with the information problem right like everything else is is a problem of lack of information um lack of understanding the patterns right like magic is just like definitively when you don't know what the math is it looks like magic if you understand the math then it's not magic right and one of the amazing things about this new wave of AI which I think started in about 2017 is Transformers Transformers are now diffusion models but basically the Transformers are at least to me very very cool very awesome because before if you wanted to understand a lot of these Concepts there's a lot of other things there are a lot of things you have to piece together to figure out like okay what is intelligence how does this thing work Transformers are super simple like it's kind of shocking how simple they are I think they're invented in like the 70s with the perceptron uh but basically you're just looking at noise and signal and then you're trying to draw patterns between the noise and the signal and what that means is as long as you have enough data you can kind of apply this problem to anything there's nothing that I said there that is domain specific whereas for example at gumroad we have a risk model at gumroad right every purchase that goes through kind of and it looks at all of these you know hundreds and hundreds of feature Flags like a human had to come in and say okay we should have a rule that you know looks at like the the letters in their email and you know kind of creates a model you know a tiny model based on like is it that ASDF gmail.com probably fraud right or whatever right and like you basically build these hundreds of rules and then you have this sort of tree function and then it kind of does this thing and comes back with a risk score saying hey you know based on what we've seen in the past you know like uh or and what humans think looks risky or not right and and basically just get rid of that and humans think right and you just say based on what we've seen in the past is this risky or not and if you think about how little code is actually required to do that it's almost nothing it's like a few dozen lines of code so what it means in practicality is that a startup like gumroad or really an indie developer can now compete with YouTube on YouTube recommendations which four years ago or even two years ago would not have been the case right basically gumroad could not have really entered the discovery we had to kind of Outsource it to Twitter and Facebook and you and you know all these other services because there's just no way that a tiny company could do recommendations at scale um what whereas now I see the problem and I'm like actually yeah I plan a tweet tomorrow that we we want to hire one ml engineer who to basically build recommendations for government like I don't think it'll take more than one person um and that's amazing right I mean like to think about like you know the hundreds of people that would have been required to build a model like this maybe five to ten years ago and data YouTube before uh before their new stuff right but now I mean it's it's a 10 or 100x and so when I look at AI like AI is automating 99 of those Engineers right now I only need one um and so it's funny because people think all of these other jobs are getting automated away but the number one job that's getting automated away is actually the software engineering job right like why is software engineering such a valuable skill it's because we've automated the crap out of it so that the people who are still able to do it are insanely highly leveraged right like I built gumroad in a weekend and you know like obviously we've built stuff on top of that but the core stuff took about 20 hours right and today would probably take about four hours or something right because I would use Chad GPT to write you know the majority of the code um and so that I mean that that I think is pretty pretty pretty pretty amazing I think it'll be a while until we get to Hardware like but but the cool thing about the whole Transformer model is in in a sense you can apply it to Hardware right you can apply it to real life experiences and so imagine that as long as you have enough cameras watching what humans are doing just like you have you know could you know you you record all the text that gets inputted uh when you buy a product on gumroad imagine if you have cameras everywhere recording all this stuff and then report you know you could totally automate tons and tons of stuff um it's pretty fascinating I mean I think I think we could see for example my guess is 10 15 years from now we'll start you know we'll be watching robots play soccer instead of humans because you can't a human cannot physically like the complexity required in my view to like build a brain it's similar to like like creating Lionel Messi's neural Pathways in his legs right like it's just it's it's possible but it's math at the end of the day but the complexity of it is like millions of lines of code like you're just never gonna get there with humans but if you can take all of what's happening and just build a model and say hey based on all this data and here's here's the inputs here's the output and now we want this new output we want a goal to get scored right what do you do in this scenario oh well based on the million pieces of data we have uh from Messi and every other soccer player we you know the only the really only the like the only real problem but basically it's gone from a science problem to an engineering problem like the science is solved we've like basically solved the science that Sports thing is interesting so yeah I mean the only thing you have to do for sports is get the data which is which is like neural link like why is Elon working on your link right like we just need to get the sensors in the place where we can get the math and the math simplifies down to zeros and ones right and so we just need to get basically the what's like the brain and and the leg are talking via nerves which is basically the you know our electronic circuit and so we just need to basically like look at what's happening there and we will we will 100 basically be able to to you know get rid of pain um probably you know short circuit depression like all these sorts of things we will be able to do without needing to know exactly what you know we'll know the math because you can look into this function right just like you can look into stable diffusion and and do the math and figure out what's actually happening um but you won't need to right it doesn't it doesn't happen overnight though I feel like let's just use the sports example for a second so let's think about how Sports and sports viewership has evolved over the last 100 years or whatever so in the beginning like you you know we would play soccer together we'd be on a field then you know radio comes out all of a sudden you're listening or television comes out you're watching other people play on a field and then you know video games come out and at the time it's like what do you mean you're watching someone play video games you're one you know you're watching Counter-Strike on Twitch like that's that's not even you know those are that's fake bodies right those are essentially just like fake bodies playing connected to a computer and then all of a sudden there's hundreds of millions of people watching that and now you know there's you you know I believe what you're saying is true which is you know everyone's seen or a lot of people have seen those um those dog videos what's the robotics Company Boston Dynamics and you watch these dogs basically move around and they look and feel like you know real dogs or real animals and it gives you this weird feeling everyone sits there you get this weird feeling and it's because you can kind of see where it's gonna go so yeah could I imagine that like instead of a dog it's a human and instead of a human maybe they're playing soccer and instead of like being trained by a human behind it maybe it's trained you know with AI Etc it it makes that's the arrow of progress yeah I think that's that's certainly the era of Technology right like if you wanted to build the best soccer player on earth 100 it would be a robot it would not be a human being right uh the question I think is also like what does that mean right like for example will people replace dogs with robot dogs because they no longer have to take them for walks if they are functionally as similar as a dog right um and I think a lot of people will not I think a lot of people will say well basically reject uh this stuff just like they're I still paint with oil paints right for example um but will you be able to make money no because what it does is it shows you that this is basically valueless I think these things have value in this weird cultural sort of bubble and Zeitgeist but the minute that a human or a robot can kind of do it just as well as a human it sort of reveals the illusion that this thing is actually useful and interesting and people will just move on to something that only humans will do I think that's really what the pattern will be is that people will play soccer for fun but not to make money I think there will be new sports that robots cannot yet do like surfing I think my my my feeling is that surfing is much harder um than soccer uh for a robot to do and so you know you'll you'll kind of move the the goal post essentially right but just for example like how many people make a living playing chess nobody right like basically four people I don't know how many people um but very very few um and I guarantee you if you look at like you know the sort of I'm sure like when robots started to be able to do this stuff it's like okay then why would I bother right like well if it's fun Do It um but certainly to make a living like getting into chess is not no one would tell you that that's what to do right um or getting into horseback riding uh but guess what like that's every job like every job is basically going to go through this thing and people I think that's the thing that the sort of like this I guess hasn't really figured out there are all these artists getting really mad that like AI is going to take their jobs or whatever but the truth is like AI took art away from their job long ago like these people are painting rocks for Pixar right like they're doing a rogue thing they're not artists they're executing a director's vision their pants they're being paid for their their hands they're being paid for the training data because they painted a lot of rocks in the past so that they know how to paint rocks now um they're not painted for like their creative Talent their taste that's another thing I think is interesting about the video game Sports thing is that basically what it's done is people who may not have had the physical stature to play soccer but did have the hand-eye coordination and the intellect to play soccer can now play FIFA and kind of can get really good at that but what it shows me is that basically everything below here is going to be done you know you're you're going to be judged more and more just based on what's in here and almost nothing else and to be honest like that's going to lead to a very unequal world because we like to think that everyone is identical here and we're just different below you know and by the way if you're listening right now and you're not watching us on YouTube oh yeah yeah I'm he's describing his head yeah my you know like basically what we're doing is we're we're we're saying that like any privilege associated with with anything else height or a body mass or you know fast switch muscle fibers basically is not going to matter 100 years from now right just like for example height doesn't really matter in in today's society but it used to 100 years ago um and that's going to just continue to happen until basically we're all just able to like you know we were kind of born we we like reach puberty and that's basically as as functional as we're ever going to be because everything else you know all the training all the memorization all that stuff whereas we've sort of already outsourced um and really the only stuff that differentiates us is stuff like working memory which all the stuff is basically genetic so that's going to be weird I think we're going to severely have to rewrite like how how we how we think of of human beings and values and taxes and income inequality all these things are going to have to change pretty dramatically probably should have in the 70s um but you know it's going to get worse and worse and worse did you see this thread by this guy uh Francois Chalet he's um yeah deep learning guy um at Google um so he tweeted for those who didn't see it the current climate and AI has so many parallels the 2021 web3 it's making me uncomfortable narratives based on zero data are acceptable like are accepted as self-evident everyone is expecting as a sure thing civilization altering impact and a hundred times return on investment in the next two to three years personally I think there's a bull case and a bear case the bull case is way more conservative than what the median person on my timeline considers as completely self-evident and the actual outcome we'll see is statistically likely to lie in between somewhat closer to the bear case what do you think about that I mean I have I don't care at all about the the financial investment piece of it right so uh is it going to be 100x is there any way to make money on AI like I have no idea um but will it dramatically transform Society yeah 100 I mean I I don't I don't think this is anything new I think this is what data does it automates wrote uh input and I don't see why I don't see how that I mean definitely I can see why people are saying oh this is just like web3 in the sense that there's lots of people loud and proud on Twitter um but I think you could apply the same thing to tons and tons of other stuff right um that people I mean just we we coalesce me medically about certain topics and then share those things and the truth is people on Twitter uh are attention [ __ ] and so we are I mean that's I will I love the uh the The View count frankly because it exposes us for the attention [ __ ] that we are that's why we tweet we want views um why do we want attention so we can make money at some point in the future based on that attention and so yeah of course you're going to have like a similar sort of zeitgeist build up around AI um 99 of it is is BS um however like I spent most of the web 3 stuff reading papers and I spend most of my AI time reading papers uh and so I can compare the papers from Ai and compare the papers in crypto and the papers in crypto are actually quite interesting I can give you two or three that are incredibly compelling I can give you two or three a week in AI that are incredibly compelling right and so I think that's very very different I think crypto is mostly Engineers outside of Academia I think AI is mostly Engineers within Academia and so you have I think you have a much higher bar to get stuff funded in Academia you have many more diverse viewpoints in in AI um my guess is in web3 there you know almost everybody was anti-web 3 except for like a few hundred people right that made a lot of money um so I don't I don't think it's the same at all I think he probably just follows like a a very uh you know small slice of of the population I will agree with him though on that 100 x investing right because that I do think is a problem um I never thought that that went through was a great way to make money necessarily um I again I'm a builder I like technology right like if you ask me what's interesting about crypto I'll tell you the interesting technology um like the general the Byzantine generals problem that led to bitcoin for example that's super compelling the turn completeness of ethereum is super compelling and my investments follow technology so I cannot invest in something unless there is a paper or unless there's some code that's interesting that hasn't been written in that way before because that's how you make money as if you see like like I do um and so yeah I definitely agree with him that like I could 100 see that like 10 years from now there's there's no way to make money in AI right like basically nobody made any money on AI all the returns basically just went to you know whoever like basically gets attention so that they can monetize via ads um I actually think that's quite likely um and that's why I like being an investor so I can invest in a bunch of stuff but I'm not you know spending my you know I'm not putting all my eggs you know in one basket I'm not a CEO of a company um in this space I would say by the way that like that's always the other thing is like I just like like there's all these people who have opinions uh on Twitter like you should ignore 99.9 of them right because what really matters is like what's on like what's on their screen like what are they looking at um are they generally if they're not looking at code I don't really care about their opinion to be honest um and I've held this view for a long time like if you if you I tweeted a while ago it was I don't know I've got some pushback but I basically said if you want to avoid scams only invest in people who know how to code um and obviously the counter factual is a fallacy so you you can't reverse chain that and say oh well would you invest in people who don't know how to code of course I would um but certainly the number one you know thing you could do to to kind of invest in and make money frankly is to invest in people who know how to code because those people are the most leveraged people everybody else is basically building an audience off of of skill set that's just not that valuable in today's society and so we're really struggling to do so which is why we're hyping all this stuff on on the internet all the time can't you you know okay so I I understand your argument which is basically like if you want the most amount of Leverage learn how to code because you're basically building a machine like like you you know you started gumroad uh which is essentially payments for creators landing pages for creators and you know I'm sure hundreds of millions of dollars have gone through the platform and you start you know the MVP was in two weeks the memorable viable product was built or sorry the minimal Bible products are built in a weekend um so code is magical in that sense but can't you you know be a magician as a designer a copywriter a marketer yeah I don't think so and the reason is because uh it's not a it's not an or uh the best uh painter is I know right coat so it's just not it it writing code doesn't mean you cannot be a painter cannot be all of these other things and so what ends up happening uh is that the best painters are the ones who know how to code and because they know how to code they can basically automate 10 20 30 of of their peers um and so that's generally like for example a really uh you can see this in art um in the entertainment industry uh for example because in back in the day like if you worked on Star Wars in the 70s you were doing everything traditionally and then basically photobashing started happening so things started to go digital by the way artists freaked out about that change where they're like what no you can't do digital that's crazy copy paste what you know uh copy paste no way uh and then photobashing became a thing because you could now basically like do a mock and then you could take a bunch of photos and and skew them on Photoshop and like get really you know and people are like that's cheating that's not allowed every single movie you've seen in the theater it's used as photobashing Avatar like this is how they get to like super highly rendered map paintings in the background all the backgrounds are paintings basically and they're paintings that are photobashed together right and this is what every single amazing like Dylan Cole who's the that basically the the art director behind Avatar that's how we became famous is he basically pioneered this technique literally and so he's literally like in charge of the most you know the most important probably visual IP of this year because he automated his peers right um and he was [ __ ] on for that in the industry for a long period of time so I think what you'll end up seeing is you'll just see a continuation of that where the best uh the best artists are using AI in their workflow and they're just autumn mating all of their peers are able to do so much more work themselves um and that's what that's exactly what I see happening to be honest like I see a bunch of my artist friends uh who know how to code code takes about you know the thing is when people say like you don't want to learn a code to me that's like saying I don't want to learn how to speak English like it doesn't take a lot you know like I'm not asking you to get a four-year degree in computer science I don't have one I didn't go to I went to uh USC for one semester and dropped out all I'm saying is like Google like how to you know start a blog and ship it to Heroku um and understand that piece of code um and uh you know obviously you don't need to it's completely a choice but as an investor like I can just look at my portfolio and I can look at you know anyone can look at who's successful Google I mean if you look at startups right if you look at startups and you say Okay 99 of the public value is basically or 90 plus percent is basically in four or five companies right if you get rid of like Google Amazon meta like we haven't done [ __ ] as an industry right in terms of actually creating value the whole reason Venture Capital exists right basically they're all started by Engineers computer scientists or software Engineers uh even Bezos I think had a CS degree um and it just it's a pattern I see over and over and over again it's kind of undeniable um and I think it's just kind of you know it just it's just what it is you know what about like do you need to be writing code or could you just understand how to read code like you know I get the argument where it's like okay um you need to understand you need to understand the fundamentals so for example if you want to be an artist you have to learn perspective you have to learn anatomy And if you are not able to do perspective and Anatomy it doesn't matter how good AI is it will not help you currently at least do it Anatomy perspective design composition uh colors all of that stuff you have to learn uh and by the way if you look at artists who are not that good it's often because they don't actually have the fundamentals in place like they know how to draw dragons but they don't know perspective so the dragons look all stupid in Milwaukee right or they draw eyes that look like almonds no you have to learn the anatomy of the eye and guess what is that fun no but what is it it's stem it's science and math it always comes back to STEM Science math and Engineering um art is just like a tiny layer on top of stem a top of understanding the physics of the world and so I think when you learn computer science what I really mean is just this the equivalent of those fundamentals which means data structures conditionals algorithms you need to understand how like HTTP works you have to understand how the internet operates like when you use an app like what's what's on your phone what's you know because otherwise you can't build anything you can't really build anything new you can copy paste right like for example I can like if there's something I don't know how to do I can pretend but will I ever be able to contribute to the frontier no no and guess what guess who gets all the money all the reward it's not number two not number three right I can play chess yeah I'm not making money as a chess player all I'm saying is if I'm trying to make money as a chess player I need to be the best and the best and I guarantee you this is true I guarantee if you talk to Magnus Carl he knows how to code I guarantee you um because that's what chess is it's yeah it's and and he knows what that he knows that that's what chess is and that's why he's so good is he can figure out oh this is what it's I'm building a heuristic model and I'm exploring these paths and I basically have to figure out what's the longest path that doesn't lead to a loss um which is probably the right move to make which is guess what that's what Alpha zero does yeah yeah I think and the truth is if you can't write it you don't actually understand it so you can pretend that you get it uh but the truth is if you read the Bitcoin white paper and you haven't actually implemented it you don't actually understand it you don't actually understand what the math is um and therefore you're never going to build anything that's a like to build something so compelling that it's created billions of dollars in value is so hard and so rare to think that the you know 50 or 100 hours of curriculum you have to do to like unlock that like that you like that's gonna like of course you're gonna need that right because it's not that hard of a barrier to overcome so of course there's going to be a thousand I don't know how many this is like 10 million people in the world that can code so why would you be you know if you can't like why would I you know so anyway yeah my my takeaway from what you're saying really is you know one of the most important things that we teach our children is understanding physics right like if I take this apple and I drop it to the ground it moves down at 9.8 meters per squared I know that this uh this apple is gonna hit the ground and I know how to navigate my world based on these laws that govern our world what you're saying is basically like we're spending a lot of time in these digital worlds and what governs our digital world are are these sets of laws not really physics but it's enforced by code so to if you want to you know go out in the wild wild west and you want to you know stake a claim basically you know you really need to understand like the equivalent of gravity but in our Virtual Worlds is that right like for yeah exactly like for example I own a house I bought a house you know 300 Grand whatever but would I ever claim to be a real estate developer or an investor no because I don't understand like migration patterns I don't understand whether I don't understand flooding in this region I don't understand the atmospheric River whatever the hell that is people are talking about it's whatever I don't understand traffic flows like all of these things if you want to do you know you're not you're not living in a vacuum that's the other thing is like there are seven billion eight billion whatever the number is people out there who want to make money too right and so yeah if you were the only person then yeah you totally could do this without knowing traffic flows but in a world in which Blackstone knows that stuff you are going to get destroyed by them right because you don't know that stuff and that's what I see all day in in in in our field is that like I can build gumroad in a weekend um and I can outship basically any if it doesn't matter how awesome your team is if it doesn't have Engineers on it I will beat them right I would just I will win um I can chip more code than most of my portfolio companies and I'm a technical person that generally only invests in technical teams uh and so I it's just it's a I don't think people really rock the the sort of difference that can make right like I can make gumroad every weekend which means I can make a new company every weekend and that company can probably raise money at a 10 15 million post money valuation I can do that literally every single weekend that's like insane a lot of people ask me Greg how do you build products that Foster Community well I've got good news that's exactly what late checkout does my company we partner with the largest brands in the world and fast-paced startups to design products that resonate with your community we add a couple interesting clients every single year so if you're interested and that sounds like you email front desk at laycheckout.studio with what you're working on what you need help with and don't forget to mention the where it happens pod thank you [Music] so what do you what do you recommend to people who might not be technical but who are listening to you now and be like you know what this guy's crazy but he might be on to something um so I'm willing to to dedicate some some of my time in 2023 to learning to be more Technical and shipping one product or two products I mean I think that you know what I did was I really wanted to build something and the only way for me to build that thing was to learn how to code because I had no money to hire anybody else which is true for most people Engineers by the way are very expensive so if you can't learn a code let's just say you're you're going to spend 250 Grand a year on one person right so good luck building a successful company uh uh with that that's just almost impossible um so I would say find something that you really want to build it doesn't matter how simple or easy uh the actually the simpler the easier the better probably and build that thing like the first thing I think I ever built was a GPA calculator where in just in Excel you I put in my math classes and then I put it or you know my classes or whatever and then I put in like my you know a b e c d whatever and then I just had a you know column that said like if a for if B3 whatever and then you know like some divide by number of classes and that was like a calculator I built like little GPA calculator in Excel and then build that with python like build the exact same thing but just build it with python like you know use Chad gbt probably write 99 of that code for you and then just write a python script that's just local on your computer but you need to solve like like some problem that and and the way that I think about it is save time or save money generally like what do you spend time or money doing that you wish you didn't and then just automate that um and then you know uh you you know there should be something in your life that you're like oh I spend five minutes like doing these three things it's like okay I can't like for example let's say you wake up and you open like seven tabs right uh you open like Twitter and Reddit and whatever and it's part of your job well write a script that opens those seven tabs for you and then all you have to do is run one script and boom it'll it'll open up and guess what when you have that script you can start doing other stuff once you have the glue you can start saying oh well what you know you could actually parse the tweets and turn it into like a you know like probably by the end of the day I could take I could probably take like my Twitter feed and turn it into a 30 minute podcast that I could listen to like while at the gym or something right it would take me probably like a few hours uh to do with the current Tech um I don't know if there's a product there I don't know if there's a business there but I know that doing that you know will teach me skills um and certainly like in 2022 would have been enough to raise a million bucks right or whatever um and so I would just say always always start there um uh and then I would also to be honest like I have tons of friends who are like I want to learn to code and then like two years go by and they they haven't and I just tell them like you will never do it like stop wanting to do something you will never do it just makes you sad and depressed right like for example I don't intend to ever play in the NBA never not in my you know you can't tell but I'm actually nine feet tall right um but uh no just it was never on my it was never on my list of things to do because I knew that I would never be any good at it because I just don't have the I just literally cannot you know I don't have the height um and thank God I wasn't born in 1892 I would have been screwed at the factory right um but luckily I was born in 1992 and the world is my oyster because I know how to code why I don't know uh and so that's the other thing is just like figure out what you know life's not a vacuum so like figure out what you want to do don't let other people tell you what you want to do um and it's never been cheaper than you know to be happier like it's it's like almost free to be happy like move to a place near the near the equator and you'll pay almost no no nothing in you know and like rent will be a few hundred bucks a month food will be almost free uh if you speak English you can probably make that and just you know teaching people English let's come back let's come back to that quality of life thing because I want to get back to that because I'm interested in that actually but on the on the how do you become technical uh how do you take someone who's not Technical and make them technical it sounds like what you're saying is Step One is find a problem in your everyday life and you know step two is use platforms like chat GPT to help you know write some of that initial code and just start you know trying to learn from there uh go online you know obviously there's you know tons of places where you can learn different different yeah well it's it's tough the reason it's so hard the reason it's it's like why isn't this easy obviously if you can code you can make like 200 Grand a year in a in a year like why wouldn't more people not do that but it's kind of like learning English where it's it's not like there's a simple like learn this and then learn this it's like you kind of have to learn the whole thing and it's like a big puzzle piece and you're filling in the gaps like as you go and eventually you have enough knowledge that you you you maybe don't even know like I don't know English I can't tell you what the rules of English are right I Can't Tell You Why like the old red car sounds you know better than the red old car sounds weird but it does so it's just built into our brains that way we have to learn it and so coding is I think similar in which you just have to learn this stuff by lots of rote practice and building stuff and you have to start small just like English and build up from there but guess what how many people learn a foreign language almost nobody right the way you learn a foreign language is you move to a place and you're like ah crap and guess what you'll learn a foreign language about three to six months you can become basically conversationally fluent because it's not that hard um but you have to force yourself to right uh and so that that that that I think is a big one I I think if if it also is like why do you want to right that's a big question if you want to build stuff like I want to build stuff by the way you'll do it the truth is many people don't actually want to build stuff they want to make money they don't want to work anymore they have these other things that they want uh and that's why they want to build stuff and that's honestly not I don't know if that ever has worked because learning to code is like hitting your head against the wall for five years it's very satisfying because you make millions of dollars and you get to build stuff you don't have to work anymore um but it is you know frustrating on the path to getting there and so you can build the building part the building part is actually like uh not enough people talk about like how amazing it is to just like you know using your example of like the a tab script and you put it out in the world and you like post about it on Reddit or you post about it on Twitter and all of a sudden it goes viral and you're like yeah or you don't just realize holy [ __ ] like or you don't yeah like I have I have an extra 10 minutes a day right and like with that 10 minutes a day I could have an extra 20 minutes a day and like with an extra 20 minutes a day I could have an extra hour a day because I'm constantly using that uh to automate more and more and more and and the premiere way of automation like I always joke with people like the the way you automate oh almost died um the way you automate people or sorry the way you automate you just hire somebody else to do your job so like once you can make like let's say two to three hundred grand a year you don't really have to work anymore like working is very much a choice and so I like for example like how many hours a week at Gummer do I work in front of a laptop zero basically I don't I don't like I don't type I generally just respond to messages on on slack and notion and this is what most CEOs do that's like you know why why it's appealing um obviously Elon doesn't work at Tesla and SpaceX at all and those companies are doing decently well even though he's technically still the CEO of both of those companies right um and so he's you know he's automated the crap out of himself right and guess what he knows how to code it's probably not a coincidence that he he's able to do that um and so yeah I think that the the appeal is like is you really have to know why you're doing it for me it's like I don't like doing things I don't like to do and so I just automate the crap out of everything and I just it means I have you know basically after this I'm done for the day right um but how badly do you want it like most people actually if they heard about my lifestyle they'd be like no way I don't want that like I live in Oregon I talk to basically on average one human a day which is my wife I don't have a social life I don't have any friends uh in in the area I basically all of my friends are like talking about papers uh about Ai and stuff um that's it that's my life uh if that's not chose that life you chose that life right like that's that's the life you want for yourself and isn't that what a lot of people know yeah 100 yeah I mean I could I have unlimited amounts of time and money and whatever I there's no bottleneck on what I can do right um it's completely but I think that's that's attractive to people what's attractive to people isn't the fact of how you design your life particularly but is the fact that you designed your life the way you wanted it to be and you did it I think they're related the fact that I'm able to design my life like this is because I have a personality that wants a life that is like mine right for example if you like hanging out with people if you like hanging out with with your friends like every day at night you will never have my lifestyle ever because the way that I have my lifestyle is I spend my Friday nights building software that's when I built gumroad I didn't build gumro nine to five I built it when on the weekend if you don't build software on the weekend you will never build gumroad you will never have my lifestyle you just won't you just won't you have to do this stuff on the weekends you have to do this stuff on Friday nights um and and again like let's say you don't because technically you don't right obviously like there must be an example but like let's go back to the AI thing right the cool thing with AI is you don't actually have to know how to do anything you just need data and outputs and they'll tell you can you do it or not right based on the data I see a lot of data I can't think of a single example to be honest I can't think of a single example of someone who is non-technical doesn't have any interest in knowing how to code and has built a 10 billion dollar company like is it possible yeah of course it is possible but that person got killed by someone who was working on Friday night right like that's what tends to happen uh like zoc didn't win because he was the best engineer on planet Earth it's because he really wanted to build stuff um I don't even think Facebook was his idea right like but he won why did he win like you know uh because he was the one who knew how to code yeah I think that's another another benefit like if we forget for one second like the financial benefits of learning how to code and building the other benefit I think you'll agree with this is it just feels really good like conceptualizing something and just like putting it out there like I remember the first time I coded anything I was lucky that the school I went to in the seventh grade they had a coding class took it and one of the first projects was um build something in Visual Basic sex so this is a long time ago for those of you who know what that is um and I I built a slot machine I thought it'd be fun to build a slot machine I built it and just seeing it work like such a incredible feeling that I built this thing I published it other people could use it and it didn't make a difference if a million people used it or I just used it didn't make a difference if I you know created a casino around it and made all this money from it like I didn't care I was just like wow I I got to build this and there's something powerful about like you could die and that thing still exists like there's something at least to me that was important it's like it was almost like a legacy of like if I can build stuff put it I think tweeting and all these things are similar like when you write a great thing and you put it out there you're like this is part of your kind of your your public you know output uh that will exist long after you're dead or whatever um but for some reason building like I built like a game too like breakout you know and uh my teacher was like you can't play video games during class unless you made the game yourself and I was like cool I'll go build a game that I want to play uh and did you know uh good good teacher by the way and uh you know but it was it was Naval your teacher or something oh man I can't imagine Naval I don't even know if Naval would teach you'd be like here's a laptop here's math Edition and and you figure out the rest I don't know right yeah let's talk about that for one second What would if Naval was designing you know a high school or something what would what would it be like I've talked to him about this actually I asked him this exact question I was like how do you you know he has kids like how do you think about how do you just think about raising a kid and teaching them and he said he he said not too different I think it's like focus on math basically like if I think I think math is the underlying you know now I'm saying my own stuff but like basically math is the underlying substrate of reality it's the language that we use uh and so if you can teach someone math then they can learn whatever the hell else they want given the internet like you know math is the sort of like for like I've been thinking about this actually with AI it's like what is what is missing what is missing currently from AI right now like what is next right like how do you like can it get better what what what does it take to get better and I think the number one thing that's missing is basically discrimination where right now you basically get all this data and you just you know you use that data just but you like currently the AI doesn't get a choice of like did I learn the is this actually right or not right like it just says oh cool yeah like these strings lead to this strings I can do that right um and I think what's really important what a lot of people I think Miss is like when you get new data right like what did you learn that was actually not correct and this is why the probabilistic piece I think is actually really important because almost definitely there's a probability assigned to every single thing that you've learned like how true is this thing and often you read a book and you're like oh my God I'm so much smarter right because I learned all these things very few people read a book and they're like holy [ __ ] I'm so stupid now because I think I'm smart but actually half the things that are in this book are actually completely wrong and so to me what's so important about math is that it allows you this objective framework in which to evaluate new information so when I learned a new thing most of the stuff I read to be honest on the internet I'm like this is wrong I just it doesn't go into my mental model at all um like that's why I have to read papers and I have to read books basically the only things that I can add to my brain are through books and through papers because nothing else has the foundational uh has enough foundational stuff there for me to feel good enough about adding it to my mental model um and so I think that's that's where you start and I I would say if you can't like you can't really teach anyone anything is my guess they have to want to learn it and so I think you have to give them access to a computer and you have to teach them maybe some basic skills like English you know speaking writing and some math maybe some Physics or something and at that point it's like here's a laptop what do you want to learn what do you want to build what do you want to do like what do you want to understand and that's all you can really do uh like there's there's a big controversy right now in the UK because it's like oh like Rishi sunak is like making everyone do math and math is super key and in the US we're talking about it like oh you know we more people need to know math like we're getting screwed by China and India blah blah uh and it's like well I think the thing that people aren't really questioning is like well what if you can't like but it's not new that like we've wanted to teach people these skills for hundreds of years what if you just can't there's certain people who want and it's not capability in my view it's purely a desire I I like I want to build stuff like when I share that thing and it works and it does its thing it feels super good like I get a a deep amount of serotonin in my brain um that I don't get if I like see a nice thing at the at the jewelry shop and buy it and take it home but I know that my wife is completely opposite from me she doesn't care at all about what I do and she loves what she does and so I think people are different and we have to acknowledge that and that will skew in these ways and I think we're forcing everyone to say everyone needs to learn math because Math's essential in this new Society uh it's like yeah you should learn addition and subtraction and multiplication and division which by the way was enough for the Romans to function like they didn't even have the number zero which means they didn't even know multiplication the Romans you can do accounting you can do real estate you can do all these things without without even multiplication multiplication sorry the Romans didn't have the number zero yeah yeah because you don't need it you don't really need it uh like why would you need the number zero what's what's the use of the number zero uh the number zero doesn't exist inherently right like it literally refers to the concept of not existing so the only the only reason you need zero is I mean there's a lot of benefits uh two inventing zero because once you have zero then you can you have the decimal system then you can do multiplication once you have multiplication you can do exponentiation once you have exponentiation now you can do predictions you're gonna statistical modeling so if you're an investor then yes you need multiplication um but basically if you're a real estate agent or if you're an accountant which were the basically the two core money related roles for a long period of time you only need addition I was actually talking to somebody and I was like yeah you don't need any multiplication for accounting he's like I'm the CFO of this major brand and you're telling me that like you can do my entire job with addition and like after five seconds he was like yeah I guess you can it's called double entry accounting that's why is double entry accounting a thing because there's no zero so how do you make a zero it's plus one negative one so yeah you don't you don't need multiplication accounting uh Romans didn't have it that's why they couldn't predict anything you know you can't you need multiplication to predict um also what's really fascinating is in nature the concept of multiplication only exists once there's only been one time in the history of the universe where like multiplication has existed but beyond that we've just basically from The Big Bang just like divided stuff into pieces which is DNA life life is the only thing that actually has the property of multiplication that's it uh so yeah it's kind of crazy I think it's like it's fundamentally like it like kind of kind of crazy how important math is and also how long we didn't have it you know um but it also shows we don't actually need it like we don't actually have to like you know this is the other thing it's like a hundred thousand software Engineers can run the world like we don't need a million we don't need 10 million and we'll by the way never get them anyway we can try we can we can give everyone college degrees uh by the way most people with TS degrees don't know how to code you know uh it's just we're we're we're we're like we just have to be okay with like there's a limited quantity of these people who want to do it and have the capacity to um and let's like make those people really really successful let's tax the crap out of them so we can all do pretty well um but I do think like this the thing I really agree with on like the whole like sort of Ponzi stuff or on crypto and stuff it's like the vast majority of us are just grifters there's like a few people actually building the tech um and actually like the number of people because of automation is actually getting smaller all the time right I think this is a huge reason that like the managerial class exists it's because they're all these people who would have been automated away in the 70s because of computer science uh and are like no I still need a job that's nice uh air-conditioned and I want to type on a laptop so let's create all this crap right um because how do you not uh but I totally think you could run like America with like you know like a few thousand people right um with software again like what is how many how many people like working for the Social Security Administration I think it's like a hundred thousand people or something you know it's like maybe Millions I don't know tons of people how many of you it's really neat again it's just so the IRS hired like 87 000 new people to go you know audit people yeah and what was that it's literally just math it's completely automated it should be completely automated uh it should require actually like the goal is zero like the goal is is gum red for example we have zero full-time employees the goal is zero right uh you can 100 run government like the US government was like a bunch of part-time employees for a long time right like let's get back to that um and you can do it now with code um it's certainly possible it's just the problem is how do you actually you require you need leadership to actually Implement all these things and you need consensus and like all these other things and it'll certainly happen in the next like few hundred years is my guess um oh yeah I I again it kind of but it comes back to like well what do people do right uh what do people do well they won't be making art like people think they won't be poets because AI will show people that that's all kind of a BS thing that we just did at a period of time and like people actually don't like making art and poems uh if there is if there is no monetary or fame attached to it that's the truth I mean that's pretty revealed during what people what you know covet and the pandemic and all these things like it's pretty clear that people don't actually like doing this stuff um so what do people want to do well my guess is they they would move closer to the Equator and use their bodies uh more uh is generally what I would and guess what this is what people do like what do rich people do on like they go to Italy and Greece and they walk around and eat food and they go to the African safari and they walk around and eat food and they go that is what humans do that's what humans would prefer to do uh if we had unlimited time and money we would do that and so why the hell are we all living in Russia and like Portland Oregon and you know like we should all be moving closer and closer to the Equator um it's honestly shocking to me that that like that isn't like a like we have all this like housing prices you want housing prices to go down get the people here who shouldn't even be here anymore they just hear randomly because they're like you know two three generations ago someone wanted beaver pelts to sell to Chinese Emperors right and move them the hell down uh like it's crazy to me um there's only as a Canadian I I I I don't I definitely feel for and feel that I I mean I literally cannot live in Portland Oregon like I'm deeply vitamin D deficient because I have too much melanin in my skin so I I like physically get depressed like I physically feel it uh and my guess is actually I'm not the only one who physically feels that I'm just more aware of it because I have Choice um and and freedom and grew up in Singapore near the equator but like no I have a completely have depression like three to four months of the year because it's gray and there's no sun basically um like why the hell am I here I wouldn't be without you know without my wife basically um but then why the hell is everybody else here it's well they can't move anywhere they like they just you know it's like the conceptual model to be like I can leave you know it doesn't really exist um well one is borders like one is like there's a legitimate 100 I mean that definitely needs we need to figure that out I mean that's what that's why I think there should be an effort like we should figure out how do we get where there's all these all these next thing and moving to America which is awesome they totally should but guess what should also be happening all these Americans should be moving to Mexico Mexico is super cheap and way better weather like why are you here you know um you should be here if you're if your goal is to innovate if your goal is to make money but as soon as you've done those sort of things you should like don't go to Florida like go to Costa Rica go to like literally go anywhere else in the world where your talent is so necessary it's so vitally important your your your your memes and genes are would be would do so much value in in these other places but but that I think that's a huge like liquidity problem that we have that uh that that that yeah that that should totally change um but it honestly blew my mind because I I think this was a bias that I had like I grew up in Singapore and I was an SF and like was born in New York to Indian parents like everyone I knew was always an immigrant it was always like oh you know and then like now I live in Portland Oregon like 99.9 of the people I talk to were born and raised here you know like and then shocked it honestly blew my mind wait it's like it was like wait what like you can just never leave your little place on earth like even though you know everything is there um yeah I was like it's crazy to me yeah I mean I think I mean a lot of thoughts there and we don't have that much time but I think listen I think first of all some people are just the you know they're they're in Portland because they're in Portland like there's an inertia to the place that you live and it's difficult to get up and leave everything you know for something new that's just like a difficult thing that a lot of people have to deal with the other thing is like family is a big pull for for a lot of people right like I guess it's honestly an entirely family I actually don't think the first one matters at all I think that's purely family yeah yeah I think people stick here because they they can't imagine life without their family I see my family like once every six months this is It's just who I am it's my personality it's the personality my immigrant parents um it's the life that you design we'll build billion dollar companies too it's the life that you design for yourself right like it's the it's like it's like you want yeah and I think I don't value I don't value like hanging out with my parents weekly so I think you know is it a great place to end which is if people want to get the life that they imagine for themselves like how do you recommend them to reach out life honestly I think everyone has it that's my current belief is that everybody basically has the life that they want because the truth is like people do have the freedom to change if they wanted to and they don't um so most people like don't want to leave their family and that's totally fine uh I did you know most people don't want to learn how to code and that's totally fine I did I think what's most important is that people should want stop wanting things that they don't actually want I think the the biggest concern I have right now is that people look at social media and they think they want all those things um and maybe they even do want those things but they wouldn't have if they never saw it they wouldn't want a six-pack if they never saw someone with a six-pack uh right like these sorts of things and so I think most people should just really focus on what's really important to them and make sure that they're getting those sorts of things and I bet that they are and that they maybe just feel guilty because other people are saying oh no you should be doing this and you should be doing that and you should be doing that no like I don't think most people should be learning how to code I never said that all I said is if you want to like Live My Lifestyle you're going to need it because that's the only way you can automate stuff is with code but have you have you read uh I'm reading it right now wanting the Creative Cycle yeah is that the Luke Borges book yeah so it's something about the power yeah the power of memic desire in everyday life and it's just goes through um this desire that all human human beings have to copy other human beings if I see someone with a Rolex I'm going to want to Rolex if I see someone with a lot of followers I'm going to want a lot of followers and it's an absolute must read yeah and and I would say that there are certain people who don't have memetic Drive nearly as much as other people yeah right like I don't have a watch uh I don't have anything besides a T-shirt and pant like I have the essentials I wrote a book called The minimalist entrepreneur right like I don't have things I don't like everything fits in a suitcase um or a backpack actually um and that's it I don't like I don't want anything else I really don't want like why do I have lots of money is just so I can invest in startups like I don't want any physical things I just don't have I have zero desires for that you know why do I have a house the only reason is because there are other human beings in my life now and that's why I need a house otherwise I don't really even need a house right um and so that's the other thing it's like this is who I am like I can't change it or I could but I don't want to I don't want to want more you know uh I I found it weird that people have more but like I've just never I've never been that person like in high school or whatever like I've never like who wants a nice fancy car like no that's ridiculous um however I would say that like one thing that was really important to me growing up is the fact that I didn't grow up in a single place right like my parents are from India I was born in New York grew up in Hong Kong Singapore in London and so very quickly I think maybe that showed me that like this this whole thing is a medic social game but like everyone is copying each other and when you constantly move from one place to one place you realize like oh there's a game over here people are playing that's the social game over here there's a social game over here that people are playing but what's really important is basically I think of it like there's three things which is family money and weather that's it those are the only three things that matter fundamentally and I think most people actually are memetic and buying all those things to get laid which is family they feel like they won't be able to do that thing that they really want to do which is have a family and so they need the watch they need the car they need all those things and by the way they might be right they might be right about those things because in many cultures those things do matter I don't need those things why because I can code so I can show people my status very easily I don't need to buy fancy clothes and cars because I can show people that I know how to code and everyone knows that I could get all those other things if I wanted to and so I don't need those other things at all so I'm playing the exact same social memetic game that everybody else is playing you just I don't I can play it you know I can I'm just at a different level uh and I got lucky I think you know in being able to play that but it's not a coincidence that like biology and Naval and me like have a similar aesthetic a similar life a similar disconnection to society we all know how to code uh we'll have lots of Twitter followers um and we all have you know tons and tons of people who want who say they want to be like us but the truth is they don't otherwise they would be otherwise they would be building stuff on the weekends and living in the middle of nowhere but when you actually look at them and you're like oh no you actually like they'll be like oh I really want to be like you and I'll go to their Instagram account like you definitely don't want to be like me like you're posting pictures on a boat like I would never do that so like they want money they want other things they want whatever things that they think I may be able to you know I have but it's a package deal right at the end of the day you can only be jealous of someone if you want if you if you're willing to get everything that they have and to get everything that they have there's this big inertia that exists like a lot of people might be listening to this and be like yeah like I'd love to make something like sahil's made or I'd love to get as many Twitter followers as style has but there's inertia what do you like you're obviously natural in the sense that you you're you know you you've got a bias for Action so you don't have much inertia but how do you recommend to people who don't necessarily have a bias for Action to how do you stimulate that I mean I would say the the most important thing you can do is to force it right so there's that scene from like The Dark Knight Rises where you know like the kind of the bridge Burns and he has to do the thing right I think that's you burn the boats right like for example you want to start a company you want to do a startup move to San Francisco I did work for a start I did again like the data is the truth like look at what people have done me biology and Naval moved to San Francisco and worked at startups in order to start our own startups and so there are all these people who are like oh I really want to do that but I have too much inertia I have too much family then leave move the number one most important thing by far anyone could do who's listening to this is literally physically changed your location by far because that will sever all of these things in your life that are preventing you from from moving forward um so you know just move like physically move um and if you can't do that just be okay with not moving which means not getting all of these things that you think you want but you actually don't want because your family is more important than those things and that's great I I wish I wish that family was as important to me as it is to them but it's not it just isn't um that might be due to Childhood trauma that might be due to genes that might be who knows why that may be the socialization um but that's just the truth of of who I am and the things that I get to do um because of it you know like I don't mind working 60 plus hours a week I love it you know um when I go on holiday like I wish I were working guess what if you are on holiday and you're like I love being on holiday I'm sorry to say that like you know doing a startup is probably not for you right um but better to be truthful about that than to to say hey you can like here's a million bucks and then like four years from now you're gonna realize that this is not for you because guess what like the the company only matters 10 years from now that's the other thing a math teacher told me this one time where I was like this is math right math very key here's a good mathematical concept um which is like uh I think I I got close to doing something and I'm like I got 80 of the way there so like I should get like an 80 and he's like cool walk 80 of the way to the door and so I do and he's like are you out the door I said no he's like yeah so in math for example rule of math uh fractions don't exist they don't exist there's no proof of fractions use zero and you have one that's it there's no proof of half of anything in real life because if you have half of something then you just have one of that half right you only have one um and that was a that was a super important concept I think there's so many people right now I see it in my portfolio to be honest I see Founders I'm like you're you're gonna keep doing this thing and you're gonna realize it's not for you in two or three years and do do something else you know like I'm you're 11 years into gumroad right like seven years into government it was a failure um and the only reason I kept going is because I knew how to code because I could run the whole thing myself which means I could automate the entire thing and go do other stuff in my life which gave it the time to actually Thrive so if I didn't know how to code you wouldn't be listening to this today gum would be would be dead you know like there's so many instances that this this stuff has saved has saved me and that's the thing is when you look at Facebook and Twitter and all these examples of I was like oh what they're all these other rules all these other things like yeah but like basically they all died like in in the instance that Elon didn't know how to code Tesla would have died you know in the instance of Naval knowing not knowing how to code Angelus would have died like the amount of near deaths that these companies have is incredibly high and basically the only way that these companies exist is because the people at the top are insanely competent and self-reliant um because the truth is when these things become near-death experiences everybody leaves everybody gets off the boat except for you you're by yourself uh basically you're by yourself um the hardest decisions I look at gumroad I was the only person in the room making them you know I'm sure the same is true with Steve Jobs at Apple and Naval at angelist and Elon and Twitter like you're the only person who thinks this is a good idea you know um and the only way that's possible is if you are literally possible to you you can do it by yourself um like Elon knows how to make rockets go to space I believe uh not because he wants to but because he has to like he has to know how to do all those pieces um so that that I think goes back to you know your point around like inertia is like you have to you you have to want it so badly that like there's like you wouldn't frankly you wouldn't even be asking the question right because you would have already done the thing right like I I I love writing Science Fiction and Fantasy I was talking to Brandon Sanderson about this and he said you know like the truth is like the people who write science fiction fantasy and do it really well they can't do anything else and the fact that you want you have a choice that you this is something you do for fun you're probably never going to be able to do this at this level you know so I think I mean that's interesting okay I've got a I got a few thoughts and then we gotta wrap up um I love ranting so thanks for listening no no I this is you're you're you're gonna push a lot of people's 2023 I'm trying to be more honest no I like it I like the honesty and like even if you know people only agree with 70 or 80 of what you're saying I think that the fact that if you're listening to this you're kind of like questioning things it's it's still an important exercise to do for yourself so you might not want to physically move for whatever reason but you know another you know one thing I recommend people do if they can't physically move is mentally move like mentally move in the sense of like okay you still live in you know Portland Oregon but like you know you follow or you consume content from people in San Francisco or something like I also was one of those people like I I left where I was and you know in Canada and moved to San Francisco and like this conversation with you is like one of the reasons why I loved being in San Francisco because like I hope you don't take this as like offensive like you're crazy like in the sense of like you're you've got big ideas and you've got crazy ideas and they're bold and stuff like that and like I had never met people like that until I moved to San Francisco yeah um so I think that like having like you know what's the saying like you're the average of The Five People You spend time with well you know you know you're the average of the five podcasts you consume is maybe another way of of con of putting it or or the five Twitter accounts that you follow religiously or the five YouTubers or so I think the media you consume is really really important I think that's an important piece that you're you're you're kind of I I know you believe in as well yeah no absolutely right and when I you know I grew up in Singapore and like you know before before I was you know 18 I went to you know went to college in the US um it was I was like that where I was like I want to leave I can't currently and so I'm going to Twitter was my you know social network even when I was you know back then like I'd go on Twitter every morning and I'd be like these are all my friends that I don't know yet and then when I moved you know when I finally moved to LA you know I went to Startup School in San Francisco uh to like meet those people you know um and it is yeah it is crazy um the way you speak like I speak and like I have so much confidence and everyone should totally like add layers of of like self-awareness into what I say I'm I'm conscious of the things that I say as I say them and how I say them um but I try to be but you know like you you wanna you you really want to surround yourself your environment you know with with what you want in the future right make your environment in the current look like the environment you want in the future and if that means Twitter and the books that you read and the people you follow you know resemble that um I think that does help a lot um and you can learn a lot that way too um I would say the other thing I would just add is like also don't don't worry about unfollowing people too right like sometimes you do have to let go of certain things and you know I don't get to hang out with my high school friends as much you know as I used to um and it sucks and I wish I could do more of it but you know I choose I make certain choices and other other you know some of my high school friends still hang out with each other every weekend and I see them on Instagram you know um so I think yeah at the end of the day you are a memetic right like you are going to be programmed by what you consume and so make sure that you're kind of consuming just like a diet like you're consuming things that you know you are what you eat in a way right um and I do I do think that is that is really important I would say the other thing is like do stuff with these people like don't just follow people on Twitter but like what if you could work together on something right like what if two of you like learning the code is kind of like going to the gym like it's it's work it's like it's not fun in the beginning you know you're gonna hit your head against the wall if you could do it with somebody else or do it with 10 other people or start a Discord or whatever like that's gonna make your life a lot easier too I think cool well thanks for thanks for coming on and and you know making our our brains explode and I think a lot of people are gonna love this episode where where could people get more of you and add you to their diets yes if you want to add me to your diet uh I'm on Twitter at shl uh that's the best place to yeah follow me see what I'm up to and you've got a great book I've listened to it on on audible called the minimalist entrepreneur uh definitely worth a read um I think your next book should be be called something like you know get to zero and it should be an AI book AI plus automation book um I do have a I have a domain anti-work.com which is you know that subreddit which is really funny of course they have the problem is that they have a very pessimistic view uh I try to be a little bit more optimistic but yeah that's the goal I always joke with people like the goal like entrepreneur by definition is someone who does not want to work and so you you kind of build a company and hire the people so that you can you can make the Judgment calls you can make the decisions but ideally you're not you know you're not moving the knobs uh and uh hopefully AI makes it possible so that more and more people get to experience what that what that is like all right man well we're out of time I'll see you I'll see you later yeah see you later thanks so much again [Music]

do you think of your business like that like attracting a lot of attention at the top bringing them through funnels taking them through the product because we have a lot of people listening to this that are building their own businesses so anything you can share that would be helpful the most important thing is to be sending out a unique signal into the world that is the most important thing it's going to become more important to be differentiated as artificial intelligence and gpt3 gpt4 as they begin to do a lot of writing for people you're gonna need to have a unique voice and I always think of it like radio frequencies the way that the internet works is everyone's tuning in to different frequencies and you have different radio stations you got your radio station for learning radio stations for comedy radio stations for entertainment but on the internet those are social accounts and the more unique your station and what you're saying you get uniqueness and you get strong signal you get strong signal with Clarity and you get uniqueness just by being differentiated having a different perspective on the world and then people find your station and if they like the content then they want more

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
hey everyone in this episode I talk about the biggest winners and losers in 2022 and my own personal biggest winners and losers and I just get into it tell some stories here I've never ever told and uh yeah I hope you like it [Music] 2023 January 2023 and I kind of just want to go over some of the things I've been thinking about and reflecting upon you know over the last 12 months and share it with you I'm just talking sort of from the heart here I wrote down these questions I'm just gonna sort of yeah tell you what I was thinking so best product that I bought under a hundred dollars um the first is YouTube premium it's 12.99 a month I'm like obsessed with YouTube I Love It I will you know I watch it every single day uh the no ads experience that you get with YouTube premium is just awesome especially if you're watching like podcasts like this or you know you don't really want to like break up your core experience so um I think it's well worth the time and and all the ideas extra ideas it will give you the second is I actually got this as a gift my brother got this for me this is about I think it was about 50 US dollars or so um if you're on YouTube you can see it but basically if you're listening it's this bus um it's this collectible bus um and it's actually the bus that I used to take to go from school to my home um it's the 161 bus and I keep it on my desk and it's a reminder of really where I came from and I feel like 2022 was really when I set up my home office and my desk to be like my own space and I think that's really important for people and a part of that was just getting this bus and things that get me excited and put my brain in a really cool spot so I thought that was really cool and I recommend it to everyone um most underrated company in 2022 so I mean this is a big company it's you know multi-billion dollar evaluation but zapier um it basically is a way to automate anything so for example if someone signs up to your website uh it could you know add it as a sales lead and then all of a sudden that sales will be you know adds it as a sales leading Salesforce and then you can have it set up so that pings a slack bot and then you can have it so um you know someone reaches out to it so it's just a way to like automate across thousands of apps and it really saves a lot of time and why I think it's underrated is because of what's happening with AI so I think the magic with AI of course chat GPT and you know it is magical just by using it but the real magic is when you automate it so uh AI plus automation is is going to create for example the world's best salesman or sales person um so it really closes the loop so for the example I gave where it's like I got this new lead it adds it to Salesforce um it creates this new deal then it sends it to slack and then someone follows up well what if you know chat GTP was able to create these personalized Outreach emails or even take it a step further imagine if I'm sure you've seen some of the deep fake uh you know you have like Donald Trump deep fake then he's not really saying something it's like a video of him but he's not it's not really him um or maybe you have Elon Musk saying like I totally regret buying Twitter or something like that and it's not really him well what if you created these uh AI generated fake people that let's say maybe you know a Canadian is a sales lead and he starts talking with you have this fake person essentially that gets generated that he starts talking with you know a Toronto accent and maybe people are more likely to buy from people that sound like that or or that they look like each other um so I think there's a lot of interesting things that you can do with automation uh Ai and generative Ai and I think that's why despite zapper being a billion dollar plus company I actually think it's underrated all the focus is being put on you know open AI 20 billion dollar plus valuation when I think you have to look around open Ai and ask yourself who's going to benefit from this the most overrated company in 2022 I'm just gonna have to say it's Twitter now I love Twitter I'm on Twitter all the time so but when I say it's overrated I just think that like I mean how much did we talk about Twitter Elon Musk what he's doing with Twitter I think it just got a a disproportional amount of the Mind chair and I expect you know Twitter to obviously create new products like you know they just launched views uh new features I'm sure Elon Musk has a plan for it but I actually think that a lot of other social networks are going to you know slowly start shipping at the pace if not faster than Twitter so um yeah that's why I think it's overrated um it's just like we've talked about it a lot and and maybe too much uh given its size I mean in the tech World we're kind of like oh my God Twitter is everything but you know relative to a tick tock uh it's it's actually quite small the best decision that I made uh for late checkout in in 2022 um and this is something I haven't talked about but we actually got an acquisition offer in late 2021 from one of the largest social companies in the world uh and it was an eight-figure uh acquisition offer um when you get an acquisition offer that's life-changing it definitely you're definitely like whoa you know um and and me and my co-founder sat with it for for a day or two we kind of were like this doesn't feel right because we're just having so much fun doing what we're doing and yeah it was the best decision I made uh okay fine I'll tell you who it was uh hopefully this isn't shared too too publicly but uh Twitter Twitter offered to buy us uh in in 2021 and you know we thought about it in 2022 and I'm happy we didn't because uh we probably would have gotten fired by Elon uh because he fired a lot of people so that was definitely the best decision we made when you you know actually I've started and sold companies before and I know that when you get acquired you lose control like that's a part of why why the whole point of it why someone's buying you is you have a boss even if they're telling you you're going to be independent whatever like ultimately you have a boss and they tell you what to do um and I'm just glad that uh you know I built something with my team to be really special I'm having the most fun I've ever had and losing that uh what it really sucked my worst decision I made for late checkout and and also just personally has just been not setting enough deadlines so one of the things I learned in in 2022 was I noticed that like if I told the designer hey like Design This landing page in two weeks they would design the landing page in two weeks and but if I said design the landing page in one week they would design in one week or two days they designed in two days so the interesting thing here is obviously you don't want to put too much pressure on on your teammates and that's not cool at all but I think thinking about how you can just set more deadlines basically um set more deadlines that just make people feel a little bit uncomfortable is kind of where you want to be with people not too uncomfortable that they're mentally stressed out but not like hey like just get it to me when when you're ready uh when when you think it's right so people do appreciate having some deadline to hit because it just helps them Focus and uh yeah I think that if I would have set more deadlines and in 2022 I think we would have built more products launch more products and this is only something that I really really got more Stern with towards the end of the year um so my favorite YouTube channel of 2022 is probably hodinki it's a actually a media company slash app that is all about watches and luxury watches uh they have you know a website they have videos um and they've got this show on YouTube called talking watches where they basically sit down with uh well-known people my favorite episode was was with John Mayer so they're sitting down with John Mayer and they just say like hey John like show us your watch collection and you get to hear the stories of you know why they bought this watch what their watch means to them the stories of the watches and these are people that really really care about their watches I'm not a watch collector yet maybe I will be in 2023 something I'm thinking about I just yeah I basically can't get my head around like buying such an expensive watch for thousands of dollars but yeah I think like even if you're not a watch Enthusiast just hearing about these stories and learning about the watches and learning about the movements automatic versus chords uh gold versus white gold two-tone learning about bezels and dials and Rarity it's in a lot of ways it's very similar to collecting anything or collecting nfts or some stuff like that so it's very interesting uh ho dinky talking watches and I think it's also just a glimpse into the future of what a modern Media Company would look like and what a blueprint would look like there so check it out I also really loved a YouTube channel called Sarah clip I think it's a French Channel c-e-r-c-l-e um and it's basically this you know group of people that film these incredible electronic music shows all across the world in the mo in the craziest settings in the world like they'll film stuff like at the top of Mount Everest or um just in these like crazy you know places and it's just so cool to see you know I think what's cool about it also to me is like you know they're getting the most well-known artist they're putting in the coolest settings in the world and YouTube lends itself so well to watching it on that and it's free um and they invite like a small group of people and it's just like you really feel like you're a part um of the show without having to fly to Mount Everest again like kind of a glimpse also into the future media like how do you do things that are just really pushing the envelope that'll get people to share it um I think seroqua did an incredible job and my last you know I know I'm only supposed to do one but I have to do three here my last favorite YouTube channel of the year is a channel called passport heavy um it's this YouTuber called uh jabril and he basically goes to cool places near the last place he was in was Belize but he could you know before that I'm just checking his YouTube channel right now he believes Haiti uh Ethiopia Bali but you know also travel around the US Miami San Francisco um and he goes around and he just he tries to live like the one percent basically uh he does it he does it on a budget and he just talks about how to do it how much things cost and yeah you do really feel like you're going to these places with him um so I think that's just yeah really cool Channel um I've watched him grow from a few thousand subscribers to 350 000 subscribers which is really cool I think like yeah if you're interested in travel and you're interested in uh just like doing what locals would do but also doing like really cool luxury stuff passport heavy is is the vibe all right so moving on to billionaire of the year um so I gotta put it even though he's not currently a billionaire like he doesn't have a billion dollars of cash you know Mr Beast is my billionaire of the year and he's my billionaire uh of the year for a few reasons but the first is like I think that Mr Beast will be the top 10 wealthiest people in the world by the time he's 45. uh he's he's 24 now he's growing the fastest he's the fastest growing Tick-Tock channels uh he's number one YouTube channel um we've seen that he's been able to incubate products that have gotten a lot of traction in 2022 uh feastables um Mr Beast Burger so you're starting to see that he's able to create real brands from his YouTube presence so I think that it's only a matter of time before he becomes extremely extremely wealthy uh the only way that he wouldn't be extremely extremely wealthy is if um people get tired of his format so that's the question so in 2023 what we see people get tired of this format um it will he be able to you know or does he want to recruit other people uh and create other channels and and leverage his core channel to diversify um that's what you know I think a lot of people are looking out for and if he's able to do that if he's able to incubate the guy who's going to be one of the wealthiest people in the world so my favorite community of the year goes to Fat fire and I've I've talked about fat fire in the on the Pod that fire you know stands for fine fire stands for financial Independence retire early it's a community uh all around how do you like let's say save up five hundred thousand dollars and just live off uh the four percent or five percent interest from that lump sum and then fat fire is like a bit is a bigger number it's like more of a fat number and and had a little more of a fat lifestyle based on that and there's a subreddit fat fire and you should check it out it's just you know even if your goal isn't to uh do that and make millions of dollars and retire and that sort of thing I just find it the most interesting it's such an interesting subreddit hearing what are people's problems and understanding how they're thinking about things is very valuable um I've learned some like tax saving tips from it I've learned some just general personal finance stuff from it so my favorite community and I do contribute to that Community um so that that was my favorite community of 2022 the fat fire subreddit my best investment of 2022 and I'm not just saying it was this podcast late checkout you know our design agency had got has gotten major clients from this podcast from Fortune 500 companies and it's just incredible what being in people's ears can do um if you've been with me through the start you know that my co-host was a guy named Sarah Bloom who's awesome and he ended up leaving the Pod a couple months ago and I had to sit there and be like do I really want to continue this um I didn't want as many ads uh so I basically just like blew up that piece of the business and I just started funding it myself there's a cost associated with it there's a mind chair associated with it takes time and it's been the best investment uh not only from like a financial standpoint like in the end because like clients come to us through this but also just like you know even doing this like sitting down and being like okay like what did I learn in 2022 um and then putting this out there and hearing from you all like oh hey like I also love passport heavy and but have you seen this YouTube channel like just having that connection with y'all has been awesome um so best investment and I think that you know more people should start podcasts so hit me up if you are interested in doing that my worst investment in the year I mean 2022 was obviously a horrible horrible horrible horrible year for investing in equities and crypto I would say my worst investment of the year was like from a percentage change was probably Solana and of course ethereum and Bitcoin but starting with Solana some of my nfts of course have gone down a lot um and then in this in my stock portfolio probably met a I have a big chunk of change in meta when I bought it was basically seven months ago or so or six months ago my my thesis with meta is are people pricing me in how big WhatsApp is like the world runs on WhatsApp and they barely monetized it and I think there's an opportunity for them to make billions of dollars from WhatsApp and I think Zuck knows this but he hasn't really monetized it to what it could be and I think that's the Ace in in zuck's back pocket as he's figuring out this whole metaverse VR thing WhatsApp really big makes it a valuable investment um I also think that you know Facebook is still a large platform no huge sides but decaying yet um and they can still monetize that as well so the narrative I think is just that like Facebook is dying Instagram is dying VR metaverse is anything um but I think we often forget that WhatsApp is massive um and I think that uh over the long term I actually think that a lot of these metaverse bets are gonna play uh play in the favor of meta so I haven't given up hope my biggest changed Outlook in 2022 so my answer to that is the concept of retirement so what is retirement retirement to me has always been like okay you get to a certain age um you take up golfing and you hang out on the beach um you've got a lot of gray hair that's like what I think of retirement um that's what I think about this year I started thinking about retirement differently retirement to me is like if you're doing what you love you're retired if you're spending the time how you're how you want to be spending it you're retired I don't think I'm ever going to be one of those people that are you know just going to play golf every single day um I want to you know I want to tweet forever I want to pod forever it's just fun um I wanna I wanna run my agency I want to run my studio I want to do this forever so to me it feels like I've achieved retirement and I think we just need to like Rebrand that word and rethink that word because you know Millennials gen z uh think about retirement differently and and I just think that that word needs needs a little bit of a regread so that's been my biggest change Outlook like thinking about okay like this is this is kind of it you know I run this holding company I want to do this forever it's really fun but that was my biggest change Outlook in 2022. and my last question is for 2023 one of my most excited for on the business side actually let's start with the personal side on the personal side getting good at tennis so where I live there's tennis courts and right nearby so I haven't had this racket I have balls I could use these chords they're free to use that just got to get in the habit and the routine of playing every single day or at least as much as I can four to five times a week it's a routine thing it's finding the people to play with in Miami and it's just setting in a party routine and it's just every day doing it or five times a week doing it like whatever that Cadence is and when people talk about New Year's resolutions and stuff like that like usually it's a goal with like setting routines um and my goal get good at tennis my routine find people to play with play with them often have fun so that's the personal side and then on the on the business side I'm excited about um growing our design agency you know probably work with one or two new clients in 2020 2023 and and help them build new products um you know our model is that we don't we don't work with a lot of clients we just work with a few clients but we go deep with them and then incubating new agencies so I'll talk more about that this year but uh we will be incubating new agencies you know we see a lot of opportunity there um and then building products for creators so you know at the core of you know every Creator is a strong community and you know we're excited about what we can build with them uh so more on that soon and I'm really excited about that so that's that's what I'm thinking about 2022 and where I'm going 2023 I hope you enjoyed that uh it was therapeutic talking about it here um so let me know uh on Twitter what you thought of this pod and and also do you mind subscribing like if you're listening to this and you know you enjoyed it at all uh like if you're on Spotify or apple podcast subscribe to the podcast if you're on YouTube I think I have like 8 000 subscribers it's not very many Please Please Subscribe and you can comment on

we've seen social networks have exoduses before I was at StumbleUpon and StumbleUpon was bigger than Reddit that's crazy to think and StumbleUpon had a famous redesign everyone was like this is horrible and they went to Reddit and Reddit became Reddit because of the redesign there is a non-zero chance that there is a large redesign that completely alienates a group of people and they move to other platforms

what you did with daily manifest is what I call building a community magnet the old way of thinking about it is from the advertising world too which is like a lead magnet how do you create a piece of software or a product that people want access to and in return you get their information which you can then sell them things what you did was you created something free daily manifest which you focused on a niche that you understood well because at the same time you were building the social presence on Instagram and Twitter today you have hundreds of thousands of followers on both but back then when you're starting out you know you had a few thousand followers but it was enough to get started now all of a sudden you have these people in your WhatsApp group and it's like oh hey like what do we share in common what are we building here like what could I build for you and it was basically like a very cheap way of having co-founders really in something

all right M what's going on I'm good I'm happy to be here I've been a fan for a long time yeah and I've been a Twitter fan you're always like posting interesting gen Z research stuff Creator stuff and then also just what's on your mind and I feel like Twitter's become a very cookie cutter Place recently and I wanted to bring you on the show just to just to crawl inside your brain and see what you're thinking is in store for 2023 [Music] before we get into it tell tell people what you do and and what what is night media sure so I work at a fund called night Ventures which is out of a media company or Creator management company called night media and the way that it works now is I mean there's a whole backstory to it but essentially it is a company that manages a bunch of really high profile creators and essentially around a year-ish or so ago there was this big crater economy boom and a lot of creators that were on the talent roster were offered kind of the opportunity to invest in Syndicate sometimes as Angel checks sometimes it's full on VCS and read who's one of the GPS but also the CEO of the entire company was like I'm sure we could actually build out a proper structure for this and figure out what's the deal Taste of these individual creators but then also you know we don't want to necessarily go into the whole financial advisement kind of thing so let's just find someone who really knows how to do this whole time so ended up talking to Ben Matthews who is another GP at the fund and he was at Bessemer for the for a number of years and for a long time he was really interested in what we now co-create or go to market and that looks like anything that's actually effective marketing and everything it's not paid ads um and kind of what he had seen a couple of years ago was that the future was going more towards Creator as being a part of product as creation but then also as a point of distribution so he was super interested in general in the Creator space and they kind of both partnered together brought in also as a GP the president of media who was also CEO of full screen and Rooster Teeth a number of other different kind of media companies and those are the three GPS and I work under these three guys and it is a wonderful experience so basically what we invest in is a bunch of different consumer companies so that could be consumer Healthcare could be education could be real estate could be more on the fun um you know General rural consumer cpg side but we're really trying to figure out one what's the best use in creators in the VC ecosystem is that them being Angel Investors is that them being GPS being LPS or is that kind of just a point of research where we can get closer to them better understand their communities and what they need and then invest off of that criteria cool and then you know I'm just on your website knife Ventures it says rlps are some of the most famous people on the internet they drive popular culture to billions of consumers across YouTube Tick Tock twitch podcasts and elsewhere so that's another piece of it it looks like so there are you know you have some of the biggest creators in the world invested in the fun right yeah so basically the structure of night media and definitely night Ventures is that the creators are our bosses so we basically hear everything about culture about Society about what people actually want and invest off of those Frameworks so um 50 around 50 percentage or so of rlps are creators they're some of the most famous people on the internet and they're people who are in our creator roster but then people who are also within the ecosystem who kind of have like a different Niche um that maybe we couldn't have found in our roster or people who have just expressed interest to read or Ezra or Ben before that they want it to be involved in the kind of VC space but not necessarily as a full GP yet yeah so what I find really interesting about night media night Ventures is we recently did an episode around product Studios oh yeah and how product studios are like the future of startups you know this idea around you know how do you partner with creators on launching startups how do you launch multiple a year how do you you know bootstrap them and what I like about what you're doing is either on the investment side or on the incubation side you're kind of looking at it like hey um I want to launch this product but this product makes a lot more sense with XYZ Creator here's the fun thing and this is what I was with our extension now because Knight is open to incubating with creators that are in our kind of talent roster for the people who are not also is we find a lot of creators come to the studio and are like hey I'm known now for this product and we feel weird kind of keeping referring people to different products with ingredients I don't know maybe they have morals that I don't necessarily agree with and I don't necessarily have the experience of making a full-on company I also don't have the money right now to front that um what's the best kind of course of action and that could be raising Venture money after they incubate the entire project or not but what's cool about kind of the different Suites of night is that you can really start from incubating really your community and continuing what your career could be and really validating what that Community likes and wants then you also could be going into creating that product or company and then you can really scale it out to the mass audience um so you're really kind of encapsulating what you want to be known for and what you want to make and also this you know creator has a majority of ownership here's a hot take from me I find that there are a lot of um here we go take number one we're like two minutes in and I just decided to just let it ride uh let it ride but I will admit I'm not fully on the studio side that's more of one of the partners been um and also he hired at a bunch of people who have backgrounds in in more of the incubation and product side but I do see a lot of it so by the way the fun fact on there just interrupt I I bet you know I have a fun night media story which is Ben actually called me and said one of the companies needed help fleshing out their product so we worked with rare candy um and yeah which is for those who don't know they're launching soon but they're basically a live auction like breaking of Pokemon cards and they paired with Pokemon YouTuber one of the biggest in the space and we helped them sort of like flash out their products so that's my night media story yeah and you got to work with Ben did you get yeah there you go I got to work with Ben yeah Ben Ben was my boss for a minute but it goes to show you right it goes it's like Ben is working for that group right Ben is like okay you need help with products you know you might not have the internal resources I'm gonna call like the best product people I can find I'm going to connect you with them boom so that's like a bit of the value add for the totally yeah so a lot of his background is in traditional VC but I think that that is like one of the actual redeeming qualities of the big VC mindset is that there are probably four at least it used to be that there are like 400 people that know how to do this better than I do so I'll just go find those people and bring them to you uh that traditionally is what used to be it's like that way at night Ventures and throughout night media okay em let's get into it hot take number one okay so my main interest going into the Creator space was really to be around people who have more attention and trust with consumers than I ever could or any of the founders that I was working with ever could and I think with that there are a lot of individual people who approach these creators and celebrities with the pitch that they want to create these companies for them I am definitely not the right person necessarily tonight to be talking about this but it's something that I care about because I meet a lot of these creators who have really good intentions who care a lot about their communities but there are a lot of individuals out there who want to start these brands with creators and they will help them up to launch not necessarily with a high interest in product quality or how to make it sustainable but for me most importantly um not necessarily with the accurate funding to make it be sustainable and grow as a business and I think that's one of the hardest things I've worked at a couple different consumer funds before this in kind of growing and launching and scaling specifically cpg businesses is so hard and capital intensive that I think it's sometimes a really unfair uh misunderstanding with creators is that this is something you can just launch and necessarily passively have on the side unless you're doing more of a Drop Shipping thing but I'm finding a lot of creators want to do more custom projects and that's wonderful um but one of my hot takes is to go to a actual product studio and don't necessarily work with just one one-off individual who just so happened to do a drop shipping business for a number of years not say that that's not very reputable but if you're doing a custom product that needs to be sustained as an accurate business enough where you're taking attention and time off of what your actual day job is which is creating content and cultivating this community you should be doing it with someone who is going to kind of have long-term domain ownership on how to scale that business and also who might be financially invested in it because I think that that is sometimes a Miss I'll see some really good company is kind of start off strong and then die off um and they'll the creators will kind of take it personally and I hate that but I think that that's a conversation that has to be had especially in the Creator cpg kind of industry is that these businesses are actually very expensive to start up and sustain as businesses and if you rely solely on your individual community and your individual uh Persona one you could take it personally if it doesn't necessarily pop off the way you want for it too and then two it's a missed opportunity to collab with other communities that are similar to yours other creators or similar viewers if you just look at skins probably the most famous one she's just totally removed herself from most of the of the PRN campaign ad work she's now spot letting people from different cultures who have better reputation than she does or different kinds of communities um different age groups and I think that's kind of the goal especially if you go to the cpg route um is to try to to partner yourself with other creators who are just as excited about staking themselves into your business and yeah that's my hot tape is that it's really hard so yeah it's really hard that's one thing you're saying but you're also saying like maybe it makes sense to sort of have like a collective of creators versus just one right oh yeah that's something that you're definitely going to see cashiers creators themselves creating kind of like their co-founder relationships and then finding an operator to be a third co-founder I also think one of the reasons why that's really important and I'm curious your perspective on this is communities get fatigued with product offerings often right so if you're you know Logan Paul and you're just like pumping Prime every like third word of your you know the prime drink uh every third word of your YouTube videos the audience might get a little right so the beauty about the collective is you're spreading out that cell among multiple creators I want to see research or I can kind of participate in that in community exhaustion how so all these brands have this community strategy and it's wonderful but how many BR how many communities can an individual be a part of until the previous one drops off it's now kind of out there that I used to be a One Direction fangirl I had the toothbrushes I had the you know the White Strips I had the bedspread I had everything for what it's worth I did not know that in this conversation this conversation is over no but I I kind of had that Affinity with that um with that Community for a really long time yeah um but as I literally just experienced more of life I just cared less and I think that that's really simple like when you say it out loud but it's kind of hard to remember when you have really high engagement Community strategies within companies that just because you have them for the first year or so it doesn't mean they're gonna stay for life with that being said you know we're at a moment with creators where they have the ability to Market themselves I will say also specifically men are a little bit it's a little easier for them to Market themselves as the entrepreneur and I'm doing my hustle and this is the way that it works um but also women have been doing this for many many years um and kind of when they would post these different products regardless of whatever they are if they're a lot of them necessarily probably weren't the healthiest but that goes back to kind of the ability to front capital and the ability to kind of create these businesses from scratch with the large amount of ownership but that was kind of considered to be the sellout but I think we're at the moment where this is the right time for creators to range 2023 to kind of lean into this entrepreneurship lag and show the work that they're doing behind the scenes which you see a lot of creators doing maybe you thought on their individual channels but they'll go on other channels and show their Production Studios they'll show the production work of of the product they're doing um and that is a way for them to quietly do the side hustle thing but it is very very tricky I have two thoughts two thoughts on that on the how many communities could a person possibly be a part of yes I believe that number is five and it relates to the Dunbar number are you are you familiar that's exactly where I'm getting it from yeah yeah so for those of you don't know Dunbar number 150 it's the amount of people that uh someone could possibly basically be friends with uh you know more than 150 like you can't possibly be friends with 500 700 people um so Dunmar you know I think he was a social scientist he basically came up with this number and he said this is the amount people could could actually be connected with uh the five number I call it the Eisenberg number yeah of course and we're waiting for this yeah of course and I believe that you know we exhaust after five um for some people it's actually three I think it's in the three to five range but it's basically you can't be a die-hard fan slash the biggest part of it is your identity like you can't have the identity of a One Direction fan and the identity of a Jonas Brothers brand and an identity of XYZ fan because it it then then your identity becomes muddled and when your identity becomes muddled that's when everything breaks so that's why I think that number is five so that's my Eisenberg number piece I really like the Insight that you have around how do creators showcase how this sausage is made around the products that they're building and there's a brand we actually brought the founder uh on the show called midday squares which basically is this like clean chocolate bar and when you pick up like I just bought the chocolate bar and Whole Foods yesterday and like the back of the chocolate bar there's literally like the pictures of the founders you go to their Instagram they've got like a hundred thousand followers and they're talking about their Journey here's how we raise money and here's how we do this they have this like Willy Wonka style Chocolate Factory and they're just like literally showing how the sausage is made and I think with creators especially bigger creators like the Logan Paul's of the world like I don't just care that you're selling me Prime water or whatever I want to be deeper connected to this story totally and I think that's the opportunity in 2023 for creators you know I grew up in the 90s and 2000s you know to me celebrities were people I saw on TV and movies can you talk about this new this next generation of creators and how do you see creators deeply connecting with younger audiences so this is going to be my hot take number three and I'll just throw it to the to the Future for a minute but I I still think that the definition of Creator is changing in the next year or two um only because there are so many people that now understand the value of attention even more so than money I think they get I'm gonna go buy this thing and support this person and that's kind of a concept now but that's been that way even with like Backstreet Boys and sync back in the 90s but now it's more when I give my attention in my time when I talk about other people younger individuals are more conscious that they're doing that when they spend time consuming this content that they're doing it for the benefit mostly of the Creator even if they're not super excited about whatever the thumbnail is um they will continue to watch this content because they like the person um and that's kind of the switch I think back from uh a number of years ago to now is that there is a stronger Affinity with the individual I mean this goes kind of back to the night thesis of institution to Brand to individual as kind of like that power shift throughout the past 50 years but mostly now you'll see younger individuals what they call grow up with a person and they feel a sense of nostalgia if you're like me where you're you know around your early 20s and you kind of grew up mostly on the internet now if I see someone that I used to watch around eight years ago I probably will have a stint where I'll watch them for a couple more years and if they launch a company up maybe I'll buy it or maybe at least I'll talk about it um but really younger people right now are conscious that content creation is a job they know that these people are mostly doing their job but they like the job that people are doing and they like the people that are doing the job are they there more from because you said something really interesting which is they just like the person yeah are they are they are they consuming the content more for the topic or the person it depends on who you talk to but I'll make a very strong generalization where it's about the person I'll say probably Mr Beast is one of the most impressive content creators on the planet right now um when you mostly talk to the younger people that are fans of his they are obsessed with him as a person almost as much as his content but a little bit more of him as a person as a as someone who's made it as a Creator as someone who's incredibly generous as someone who's very real and open um and I would kind of argue on the other swing of the pendulum being someone like Emma Chamberlain who kind of has created lifestyle content forever so it's a little bit more natural to kind of fall in love with her as an individual person because she's really just doing her own individual thing um but kind of it's the the idea of the person the idea of the authenticity the idea of someone who's been incredibly successful but still humble those are kind of age-old tales that have been going throughout celebrity ER and Community engagement for a number of years but now I fully boiled down to what we would now consider to be everyday people and what's really interesting is when these individuals get so much attention now you're really swaying of influence in between so the Creator status and celebrity status and those two people are kind of the creators that come to mind but really they are celebrities at this point they go to red carpets they get PR packages they're brought into these mainstream conversations as people who have expertise in kind of influence and creating content and really anything I mean it could really be anything now um but I think what's what's cool about younger kids is that they are they've seen a lot of creators fail they've seen a lot of mistakes you kind of had that cancellation I would call it like the dark period of Beauty at the end of the 2010s where you had all these different creators what you call quote unquote canceled for either quality of product or things that they've said or things that they've done or people that they've worked with and I think that that's made a lot of these new creators hyper conscious of kind of both their business decisions but also kind of how they handled their lives as almost like celebrities they know that they have attention and that it can be brought to them at any point and that's really different from the way that people used to create back in the early 2000s early 2010s but I think the way that younger people are consuming um now at least a younger wave I would say like gen alpha or kind of younger gen Z people have heard of the stories but they didn't really feel the emotional push and pull of being in a community that had a lot of really strong division so they're a little bit more open to the person and the personality and learning about their mistakes and things that they've grown about they're more open to the actual person that I think kind of more of the older gen Z Generations like a lot of people ask me Greg how do you build products that Foster Community well I've got good news that's exactly what late checkout does my company we partner with the largest brands in the world and fast-paced startups to design products that resonate with your community we add a couple interesting clients every single year so if you're interested and that sounds like you email front desk at latecheckout.studio with what you're working on what you need help with and don't forget to mention the where it happens pod thank you [Music] do you have any examples of you know not Mega Creator celebrities like Mr Beast but are like smaller up and coming creators that you look to them and you're like wow this this person is an example of where creators are gonna go in 2023 and Beyond absolutely um kidney well it's not a kid's a grown man but he's this one guy who's a friend of mine and I love him his name is Marcus Malone and he runs this brand called minted and it's out of New York um and his creation story is mostly on the he makes a lot of content about fashion and lifestyle it's more of like a big brother Persona he's very much so on the up so first it was more for his fashion and taste but now that he's made a clothing company his focus is mostly on quality and I think that that is really hard to do is to get your audience to trust you enough that you're going to produce something really good in quality and the craziest thing is that and I love him and I love you more just don't get mad at me but he's a he's he's pretty slow to put out products and even when he hears from his audience that he wants to see changes in whatever the product is he's very slow to push it out and I've never seen anyone be able to kind of hold back an audience enough where they know that if they wait long enough the products is even going to get like better with time and I think that that is an example of where I see creators going is he really knows how to get the trust of an audience and to make them kind of wait for it until it's really good and I've just never seen another Creator do that before I think it's dude okay so I I just I'm just on this guy's Instagram at Marcus Malone m-i-l-o-n-e the guy is like also like a really good looking guy you know um do you have to be good looking to be a top grader you know actually I love this question there are different kinds of mediums that will cater to whatever you feel like you're good at as an example just for myself I am still a younger girl and I am kind of going I'm not a younger girl I'm 23. that is such a meme um I'm a grown woman but I think I'm a little bit less comfortable necessarily being on camera as people would think that I am and it's mostly because I still have kind of some insecurities and I don't exactly know how to tackle that yet so I really decided to put all my energy onto Twitter where you really only see one photo and you just think about my thoughts and you interact with me as a person and you get to know my personality and I think that is really the medium that I feel the most comfortable with and I think when it comes down to personality or attractiveness you're really gonna succeed wherever you feel the most comfortable you'll maybe see a lot of creators who have amazing Aesthetics and never show their faces there are so many UTC creators who know how to create homes and create environments create food or you never see their faces and that's because they are more comfortable creating those visual Aesthetics and other people does it help yeah with uh with Marcus like you know we have thousands of people listening who are probably checking out this guy's Instagram and checking out his website yeah and seeing a lot of Engagement I would call them like a micro influencer like I don't know he's 72 000 followers on Instagram but it seems like he probably is selling millions of dollars worth of stuff I just pulled out Marcus's Tick Tock he's he's got 346 000 followers on Tick Tock he's got 10 10 million likes and his average engagement rate which is I I have I use a tool called vid IQ it's a chrome access extension to figure that out um is eight percent so it's you know the engagement rate is a great indicator of the performance of a video it is calculated using the number of likes comments and shares and Views so an eight percent engagement rate is is really high um so he's got a really engaged audience his Playbook just looking like if I were to analyze it is build a lot of attention on tick tock bring those people to Instagram nurture them on Instagram through uh if you go to his website it's like basically an email list when he has sales he posts it posts it we're recording right now between Christmas and New Year's and he's just like I'm off I'll send you an email basically like if you go to his website it's basically like happy holidays we'll be in touch put your email down which is like pretty legendary I think in your case you have a similar approach and some you know you don't have a product that you're selling really although You could argue that night Ventures is the product that you're selling but you're generating attention on Twitter and then you're trying to convert that attention so I think Twitter Tick Tock LinkedIn are great platforms to build attention and then you want to figure out like the framework for thinking about it is like how do you build attention where are you building attention where are you nurturing that attention and then how are you monetizing that nurtured attention totally totally and I will say that's the scariest moment for anybody who has any kind of attention is what is the next platform that I actually want to push my audience onto because it could work really well it could work terribly and I think it's fully dependent on if your audience is open to new forms of media and it also I mean like if your audience is mostly 50 something year old you know individuals who don't just have tick tock on their phone who say hey open a tick tock they're not gonna care uh it's kind of similarly to if a majority of your audience and I think a lot of my audience mostly is uh people who are in Tech at this point uh it used to be mostly younger women who were in Tech but now I just have General audience um just reflective of the platform itself which is a reminder to everyone Twitter last I checked was around 70 men and typically a little bit um on the younger side and I'm very happy to engage with that audience but I don't exactly know what they want because if I were to just stick with my original audience which was mostly younger women then it's a lot easier to kind of bring them on to tick tock because I know they're spending most of their time there um but I had a really interesting conversation with a friend of mine and her name was Gabby Goldberg and she's an investor at tcg I've been a fan of her for such a long time and I'm super fortunate that we've been able to become friends over the years because she was really creating like the Creator personal essays and curation essays uh back two and a half years ago that I actually found super engaging and I I really think we're kind of the more professional narratives that I identified more going into this job so she and I were kind of talking about what kinds of content she wants to create on Tick Tock and she decided to she sort of kill me for sayings on this podcast but she has a running Tick Tock um and I was asking her a number of questions on why she decided to not just go the full uh crypto route because I know that she loves it a lot she talks about the lot and kind of her thought process behind that was like just based off the algorithm itself it depends on what you're consuming it will that that will directly reflect on how your content is doing putting it out there so if I mostly consume and then that's so real like if I'm consuming mostly lifestyle content all day and I sit there and I'm like I'm gonna create a venture capital Tick Tock it's just not gonna really do as well just depending on the algorithm kind of holds you accountable that the communities that you're engaged with throughout the entire day um that's kind of what's going to make it happier or not which is also kind of how uh Twitter works but in terms of that decision on I have attention and how do I hold it I think it's really scary kind of for someone who doesn't really identify as a full-time Creator because it's like do I make a blog like I don't know maybe like traditional really great PCS used to make blogs and now if I kind of sit on there and I start making tick tocks it's like yeah I can do another attention grabbing thing and maybe it can kind of solidify a new kind of community should everyone be a part-time Creator like should do you recommend everyone start being a part-time Creator in 23 and then see if they can gain some traction get some love and and then maybe they like it so much they become full-time I would say to try it I think everyone should try it just from friends of mine from just experience with them you kind of need like five people who are gonna say hey I will like your stuff even if it flops um as long as you can find five people who will like your stuff it'll make creating content a lot easier because at least it will become kind of a joke between you and your friends if it goes terribly but I think the pros are so so intense if it if you learn how to do it well as an example for my specific job as a VC I make sure that I'm able to kind of get in contact with anyone that would be on Twitter within two days um and I've just figured out who knows what and who knows where and all that kind of stuff so I can basically promise my bosses I can get anyone on the phone in two days and my advancement as a Creator is just getting that that time lower so it really depends on what kind of job you want um and also what I'm really interested in is when people are tired of it and they get burnt out and I really don't want to do it anymore um how do you shut it all down and still kind of maintain the other part of your business right once you become a Creator part-time or full-time you essentially are on this treadmill whether you like it or not and it just depends on are you at 7.0 like are you running as fast as you can and you're just running running running AKA full-time Creator aka Mr Beasts of the world um that level or are you Tweeting once a week but it's crucial for your job to continue to tweet once a week oh yeah it's been it's been really helpful even if you saw on this past week I was doing a road map on consumer cyber security and what are the companies that can assure people that when they get their account hacked they can get them back um and kind of monitor kind of brand amongst different platforms make sure people aren't impersonating you those are companies that right now I'm really interested in looking at but I know I mean this is really bad but I I've known almost nothing about cyber security um so I just started aggressively tweeting for the past week someone get on the phone with me that knows way more than I do and if I weren't to have a Twitter in order to sit here I would have to call up friends manually and say who do you know can you email but can you and that's just so old like I I've had access to like seven people who've spent hours with me and very very fortunate to do that so I can be able to do my job right my hot take on you know being a professional Creator part-time or professional meeting like a beat you know we're in like the B2B world is it is the highest leverage thing you can do with your time like think of all the time we spend like flying to LA or New York or these different places and going to like meetups and like going for dinner with this person or going for drinks with that person or going for lunch with you know these people like if you can actually like in 2023 removed like 90 of those like discovery type meetings and replace that with like I'm gonna go heads down create content and see what kind of opportunities I attract that way I think it's such a good use of time because you can you know go go from zero like I went from zero to three hundred thousand followers basically in two years and it completely changed my life where I could sit from you know I have a house in the middle of nowhere in Canada you know in the forest in the mountains I can just like sit from there hop on a conversation via this podcast or on Twitter and be having incredible conversations that can really move my business forward my hot take is going to be not only should you like minimize those discovery meetings as much as possible IRL but every person in business should spend some amount of time as a part-time Creator I also think that especially if you're going into a consumer-facing business whether it's kind of like a traditional smaller business or within startups in general consumer experience is the most important thing to focus on that I have observed and I think that the Creator mindset and mentality will be baked into every single product that a person can kind of identify with and I know that I mentioned this before but I really really really think that Creator is just a new way of looking at consumer in general and the idea that someone can experience your product and experience your brand while also being a click away from immediately engaging with your direct competitors is a new way of creating product and running a business and that's something that I know feels super new to us but wasn't really the case 15 years ago and the only people that you really had to fight against was someone on a store shelf or just the right sales person to really nail a deal but now people have access to so many different choices in the world I think it gives especially a founder or really any operator or really anybody a Competitive Edge to not only have their own community that that they can learn from um but also kind of just better understand where you are in that flywheel I just think that Creator and consumer are essentially going to become the same thing it really is how open are you to your customers sharing their experiences with your product and with you as a person and that is going to give someone either the biggest boost in the world and essentially make their company regardless and if it's kind of a more intense company or if it's a kind of a passive consumption kind of thing that is really what's going to create a sticky company within the next 10 20 years so if you want to create a sticky company you know either become a Creator or or part or partner with a Creator you know right oh yeah I was having a conversation yesterday with Alex Lieberman he was the he's the co-founder of morningbrew yeah we'll do and he shared with me the four types of Creator businesses that he sees and I'm gonna pull them up and I want to get your opinion on it and tell me who you think is the most interesting example of each of these buckets so number one is Creator originated so he writes a creator has an idea for a business that they believe is authentic to their brand and will resonate With Their audience so what's an example of a Creator originated company that you think is really interesting I guess like Chamberlain coffee because she talks about coffee so much I mean that that fit makes sense okay Chamberlain coffee so can you for the people that don't know what Chamberlain coffee has explained who Emma is and what the brand does totally totally so Chamberlain coffee is a direct to consumer now kind of full sweet beverage brand um they originally started off with making coffee beans and ground coffee going into mixers and straws cups merch going into the matcha space now and they're sold currently in very specific retail stores like an erwan um and kind of now has this California La Vibe very Carefree but the originator and the founder of that is a Creator named Emma Chamberlain she she's in her early 20s and her brand is very authentic and it's built a very cult following off of her authenticity and realness she's been seen interviewing celebrities on red carpets and also modeling for a lot of very large campaigns but her love at the moment if you consume a lot of her long long form content a lot of it goes back to her company she is very fully invested in in this coffee brand that is kind of locally sourced and has ethical ways of um kind of creating these beans but then also kind of sharing this love of coffee that gen Z kind of has as a part of their identity and it's a part of Emma's identity too right it's super authentic like she loves coffee she's brought coffee into the conversation before she even had the company yeah I mean almost every Vlog that she used to make for the past like five years started with her making cup of coffee in the morning in her kitchen so it was very natural to see her come out with a bunch of different coffee brands I do wish that she would make more behind the scenes content about the company that's an example I would eat that up easily as a video cool okay I like that example because it's a mainstream example which you lose a couple points but you gain a couple points because it's an authentic like damn it's an authentic brand that's getting a lot of traction right now so yeah okay number two bucket number two operator originated an operator has an idea for a brand and wants to find a Creator to launch with it to have day one distribution two examples of that include Ken Austin's alcohol Brands good sport yeah if you can give me you can deduct points because she's not necessarily A Creator maybe a nepotism baby but also our favorite one Bella Hadid and Ken it's a celebrity but I would I would I mean if you talk to me any day I would say that celebrities and creators the whole thing but I will say Ken might be a common answer but that was my favorite merger um because it was very unexpected it was a very hot take people were like what is this girl doing getting into this kind of business kin is a euphorics drink company and there's an entire science behind you Forks it's very herbally based and basically when you drink this drink um it makes you feel kind of relaxed or very excited um there are different levels of herbs and caffeines and different mixture and there was a toss-up really in the past three years of these alternatives to alcohol and these these a bunch of these different brands popped up you had house rip you had Ken you had Gia you have really a whole Suite of them to a point where now if you go to a lot of different larger cities there are non-alcoholic almost like liquor stores and basically it's a battle of who can get the most attention and I think in my eyes Ken is really one and that has been that Bella Hadid who is a very famous model also someone who's gotten a lot of attention from her Instagram posts and tick tocks but mostly she's like one of the most famous models ever right now uh she decided to become a co-founder of an already existing euphorics drink company called Ken and it was very controversial because people were like why you already make so much money you don't need to do stuff like this but it really when it came down to a lot of her interviews said and she was really interested in the business itself the mission behind kind of taking people off of just drinking alcohol and having alternatives to alcohol there's a very large wave of younger consumers who don't want to participate in both purchasing and sharing alcohol um so this was a pretty pretty natural Mission alignment where she's very interested in alternative medicine very interested in wellness and that is where I think kin lives but it was a super interesting toss-up now you have some alternative alcohol companies that shut down recently just because it's decently Capital intensity business but I think probably the most successful one I could think of yeah I think when you're in a space like that where it's a new space and you're trying to define a category doing so with the Creator often makes a lot of sense um because you're educating the market right so when you're educating the market um hey like you shouldn't drink alcohol for these reasons and hey like there's this alternative and it's amazing and when you have an audience of people that already trust you it makes your job a lot easier as Founders often what we're doing is we're doing two things we're creating a product which is really really hard and then we're creating distribution which is really hard the beauty about you know Bella in this example is like the distribution's already there she just has to focus on what is the authentic product what does it look like how do I co-build it essentially with my audience see how they take it up and then eventually how do I get that to retail how do I get that to other channels so I like that example a lot uh bucket number three uh this was an easy one for you Creator incubated Creator wants to launch a business but doesn't know what to launch figures out business to launch with a partner and then launches it and the example they use is feastables which I think I was gonna say festivals can I just explain Facebook and I'll actually get my answer yes um Okay cool so feastables is a company that was incubated out of night Labs which is our incubator at night media and that story goes that Mr Beast kind of I mean he has made billions of videos about it but he was kind of creating this brand for a number of different reasons and wanted to make this large video about becoming Willy Wonka and um is very very interesting one of the most famous videos that he's he's done so far but he went to read and and Ben and the entire lapse team and was like I want to make this a sustainable company so if I put my attention behind it that it launches properly and it has good quality behind it and I think what was really frustrating for Mr Beast in that moment was that the quality of candy and snacks for younger individuals really is not there and if it is if there are alternative snacks it's really the granola mom kind of um frou-frou branding that I think a lot of especially younger guys just didn't identify with and so he thought that it was a myth because usually those are decent products that just aren't printed properly or they are branded properly and they're terrible for younger people so in creating this video he also incubated this company and happened to find one of the co-founders of kind Barr whose name is Jim and they created this real full Suite of almost gamified snacks so I mean Mr Beast is like a legend because of many different reasons but one of them is that he just knows how to sell product properly so he wants to continue really the sweepstakes aspect and uh all of the community engagement I can't like spill anything on this podcast but he wants to keep people engaged with the different launches of snacks and to show off that they have these snacks as a way to engage with his content that's how I can say it um so we call it really gamified snacking but to anybody listening he really tried to recreate the Willy Wonka aspect um with this video and also within feastables so that was an example because he was a Creator who was creating content who just so happened to also create product while creating that content and um night and Mr Beast decided to kind of seek out a operating and also previously co-founding professional who knew how to create a massive uh snack company and that just happened to be um very morally adjusted too so it was really like the happiest Union I've ever seen here's what I'll say here's what I like about it so I like the idea that snacking is a ritual similar to Emma's Chamberlain coffee like you wake I mean I woke up in the morning if you're watching this on YouTube you know we're recording this in the morning I pour some coffee it's like my ritual right um snacking is a ritual that a lot of us have and as a Creator if he can create like a more Creator focused snacking set of rituals and then connect that with his content which he's shown that he's done with like his Willy Wonka videos Etc it creates this beautiful Union around like the content makes snacks better and the snacks make the content better so love that example uh last bucket is number four creator brokered so the business already exists and the Creator is brought in to accelerate growth so an example would be Aviation gin so what's an example of basically a business that exists but the Creator comes on board and is basically there just to promote and distribute it so we also run syndicates at night Ventures that brings creators into some of the companies that we see here some of the companies that we invest in and for people kind of listening that looks like opening an individual investment vehicle where we go around and say hey this is why we're going to invest in it if you want to Independent independently participate and you're not an LP um and you want to kind of have more of an Engaged relationship with the founder you can essentially Angel invest into this Syndicate and we break off some of the allocation for creators themselves so that's that's one of the fun things that we haven't really done as much recently but um we used to do a lot here's the sad thing that I think it's gonna I think it's gonna stop um all of the examples I can think of because I want to say a software product they're more like Creator tooling companies let's hear it out for beacons obviously Elon hates it because Lincoln bio is not cool on Twitter which means it's actually cool in Real Life Link tree is a late checkout client so we're we're kind of we were homies in the beginning the beginning of this pod is doing great work I'm kidding go ahead I'll say before that I think the war of Lincoln bios is mostly the job that you have and I think when it comes to creators and personas that want to display media articles I think beacons wins I think if it's like a link tree it's more geared towards smaller operating businesses and that just the people that I see mostly using them are more like that but also career so they they both kind of intersect and for people who are trying to figure out what I'm talking about um these Lincoln bios are the ones that you click in in any creators bio or any really any person's bio and you see the little drop down of buttons that you can interact to go to either a different social media account or to go to their businesses themselves and why it kind of became hot in the Creator side is because all these creators really create content on different platforms but then also they want to collect kind of the higher engagement things like emails or kind of in the future sell them a product um so there are a lot of them but Beacon specifically the reason why they wanted to get involved with night is because they wanted to have a lot of Angel Investors that were creators and I think that in terms of so I'm kind of doing a little Switcheroo on your question in terms of the best engagement for a Founder um to get with a Creator like if you have a Creator in mind that you want to work with I would be open to the idea of them becoming an angel investor because I also have a friend named Nate O'Brien who runs uh Roadrunner BC and he is a he is a cheerleader he is like you know all of his I mean a lot of his poor coaches are not Creator tooling but the ones that are he is very happy to bring into his everyday life and to his content and I think that it's lame because I think that creators are also very effective in other kinds of businesses but I think that's also just a Founder mindset shift is like I want to bring in this Creator rather than another VC uh to help me with whatever I'm interested in doing I like it that was a good one I like it well done and it's a good segue to my the last thing I wanted to bring up with you which is have you heard of subscribe.so a lot of people here obviously know about affiliate marketing you see it all over social media use promo code Greg Eisenberg to get 10 off XYZ product yeah um in a Creator world it's it's getting bigger and bigger because of of course what's happened with Facebook and iOS 14 and and just the blockage of AD budgets there people are looking to creators to get their their products sold there's a new product this is for people to check out you can go to subscribe.so I'm not involved and and in any way I just thought it was really cool but it's this idea of paid creators and Equity so I'm on their website now creators bring the audience startups bring the equity we provide the legal marketing and budgeting tools to align incentives for the long term uh it's a y combinator company and it's this idea that you're rewarding founding creators with equity and they just it's a whole dashboard around it uh what do you think of this idea yeah curious if this is like retro to creators who just so happen to be in your community and are excited about your product and you want to kind of reward them after their excitement I think this is a great tool I would be curious to kind of figure out what the creators themselves think once they I want to know how much Equity they're given that I've got to know it and if it's different than if a Creator were to just kind of write a five to twenty five thousand dollar check into a syndicator directly into the company because there are different workarounds in terms of ownership and I want to see like what the Creator's interests are so that's that's one thing the opposite side of the coin is just because a lot of my friends are creators I think that this is something that a lot of them are open to which is great but if it's so if it's not retro and it's really just a Founder wants for a Creator to interact with them I am very very opinionated on that you should pay the creators that work with you that is to me number one um because I think Founders themselves know as much as they're very excited about their company respectfully these people at the end of the day have bills to pay and they sometimes have families and they need money so if you want to bring on a Creator and have them kind of help you with your marketing or distribution you need to pay them period And I think that Equity is not the alternative to it did you see like recently like maybe six months ago four to six months ago Shopify employees had this new feature where they can like log into their dashboard and basically say like hey I get paid a hundred thousand dollars a year I actually and I get ten thousand dollars of stock I'm actually okay getting like do you know sliding on the scale and saying I'll I'll take eighty thousand dollars but give me fifty thousand dollars a year of stock and it allowed the employee to basically shift where you know how much risk they were willing to take I think what would be really cool here if I'm subscribed is if they can do that with creators and say like depending on uh if you have you know if you have a family or you want to take less risk for example there should be some slider where it's like I want some cash and you know maybe more Equity or more equity and less cash but I think the idea of Affiliates being 100 cash is not also fair to some of the creators because if you look at if you look at like some creators who have pushed uh or promoted companies like um yeah you know I'm an advisor to public.com um you know they've raised hundreds of millions of dollars I know a lot of creators who you know public.com has sponsor them those people probably just got cash I would imagine um so they weren't able to get the upside of that of that business so I like your opinion my take is uh a slider would be really cool all right we are so out of time but this was really fun I learned a lot of just about how to think about working with creators putting yourself in their shoes and some of the opportunities and some hot takes so thank you so much M where could people find you on the internet I guess Twitter my Twitter handle is it's really embarrassing I'm showing my age it is Emily and then Herrera but the first e is an X if you just go to my website which is just my name emilyherrera.com all the links are already there Emily herrera.com One Direction you know that's where that's where it's at kidding uh no thank you so much give her a follow on Twitter it's an excellent follow and and thank you so much for learning about uh creators with us today [Music] foreign

We need community. It’s in our blood.

There’s 2 reasons why, and once you understand them, you can begin to understand human behavior.

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
here are the two reasons why we're drawn to community the first is Rene Gerard the French philosopher's concept of memetic desire memic desire is this idea that if you're wearing something I'm more likely to wear that Nike hat if I trust you human beings mimic other human beings the second reason has to do with where we evolved from we evolved from tribe we evolve from being around a bonfire we evolved from hunter-gatherers we feel comfortable being in groups and if you fast forward to today that's why we self-identify with different groups that could be skaters that could be snowboarders that could be skiers we figure out who we most align with and we pick a group

Title: Avoid Building Cookie Cutter Products - Do This Instead
Published: 2022-12-22 16:51:11 UTC
Description:
How do you know when change is good? 🤔

Change is necessary for survival, but not all change is good.

We've seen social networks have an exodus before. No platform is completely protected from this happening to them.

Take StumbleUpon for example. Once upon a time StumbleUpon was bigger than Reddit.

But they had a famous redesign that its users ended up hating, and so they all moved across to Reddit.

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
it's never been easier yes but it's never been harder to stand out it's very natural to want to create cookie cutter products and you want to be nothing from cookie cutter the whole thing around community-based products is what is their language what is their values and how do you speak to them in a way that they really understand design that means logo copy on the website that means every aspect of your business and packaging it in a way that isn't cookie cutter
