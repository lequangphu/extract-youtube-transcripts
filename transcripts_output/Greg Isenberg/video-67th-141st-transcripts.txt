00:59 - Startup Idea 1: Advanced Voice Notes 
08:46 - Startup Idea 2: N of 1: Personalized Data Science Marketplace 
16:00 - Startup Idea 3: Great Books Reimagined

1) Advanced Voice Notes 

Imagine voice notes you can actually talk to!
- Record your thoughts while walking
• AI creates smart summaries
• Team members can "interview" the recording
• Get deeper context without endless follow-up questions

The future of media might be media you can talk to.

2) N of 1: Personalized Data Science Marketplace 

Remember Netflix's $1M algorithm challenge?
Now ANYONE can be a data scientist with GPT-4.
- Post personal/business datasets
• Set bounties for predictions
• Perfect for health tracking
• New way to do personalized science

Market size: Think Kaggle but for everyone.

3) Great Books Reimagined 

Classic literature is valuable but hard to digest.

The opportunity:
• AI-powered modern translations
• Format classics for specific audiences
• Create multimedia versions
• Add interactive elements

Two markets:
- Students (massive TAM)
- Business intellectuals (high willingness to pay)

4) The Luxury AI Paradox 

Key insight: As AI makes things cheaper, human-made becomes luxury.

Examples:
• Broadway shows
• Handmade clothing
• Mechanical watches

Opportunity: Look for what AI is making cheap, then create premium human-made alternatives.

5) Voice-First Products 

Huge trend: Kids growing up with voice interfaces (Apple Watch + Siri)

Opportunities:
• Voice-first travel booking
• Conversational commerce
• Voice-native discovery engines

TAM: Could capture 1-5% of existing markets just by being voice-first.

6) Distribution Strategy for AI Apps 

Dan's approach:
• Build media presence first
• Target like-minded audience
• Use early adopters for feedback
• Start with YouTube → funnel to email
• Product-led growth after initial traction

this episode is with Dan chipper who's incubating a bunch of AI startup ideas and he gives a few away for free to us he also showed me a really cool tool about data sets and how you can build startup ideas around it I can't stop thinking about that part uh enjoy the episode uh I know you're going to come up with a bunch of startup ideas just from listening start [Music] B we got Dan chipper he's incubating some of the most interesting AI startups right now and he's doing it in a really interesting way so I brought him here so that he could he can share some of his startup ideas with everyone listening um because no one likes to be greedy with their startup ideas we don't like that so welcome thanks for having me I'm really excited all right shall we dig in Let's Do It um so the the the first idea is advanced voice notes so ideally I assume you're you're aware of advanced voice mode from chat gbt um really really cool way to like chat back and forth with with AI and what I what I notice um when I'm using that is I'll often like go take a walk and I'll like think about an issue like let's say it's a business issue or a strategy issue and I'm like having it help me like think through all the different ways I could address it and whatever and it's really good at like helping me come to like a conclusion and what I really want is then like there are people I work with like uh Brandon who runs our studio or Kate who's our editor and chief there are people who I want to like send that to and I want them to like get a little bit of the summary like the high level this is what this is what Dan thinks about this um but I know they're going to follow up with like a bunch of questions and what I want is for them to get a like text summary of it and then be able to talk to the transcript of our conversation um to like get like maybe the the summary is just sort of the tip of the iceberg but like get all the reasoning behind what I'm what I'm you know why why I decided what I decided or why I'm thinking the way I'm thinking and I think a that'll just like help me like avoid like answering lots of lots and lots of questions but B it just gives everyone else like much richer access to much richer context and it's sort of it's basically like a voice note but like it's a voice note that you can like talk to and have a conversation with that's like just an interesting idea which is like if you think about media like what where you know is the future of media media that you talk to it like what are what's dumb media and how do you make you know is that is that like a theme that you you're thinking a lot about we're we are actually um so one of the internal incubations we have is um and I think we'll probably release it I don't know like in the next week or two so it might be before this podcast is out um but it's called tldr um and what it does is um it takes all of the meetings that we have and then turns them into podcasts that are kind of like the notebook LM podcast so for me like if I miss a meeting and we're at a scale now where I can't go to all the meetings like while I'm listening while I'm like while I'm doing dishes I can like listen to a podcast that like gives me all the key takeaways of the meeting in like three minutes um and I think that's really cool and like to to sort of add on to that one things we've we've prototyped is this same interaction of like you're listening to a podcast the host is like saying something and then um you can interrupt it and be like wait I didn't get that and then it will just resp like have a conversation with you um and it's sort of like you know you know that like you know that Meme of like uh someone who's like talking to the a wall and like it's a print like print out of like their friends on the wall and they're like this is that's that's what podcasting is so it's sort of like that Meme but like they come out of the wall and they become real people for a second it's very cool I think it's human nature to want that right like people listening to this podcast are probably like wait dan I want you to explain XYZ thing so um I think that there's probably a hundred startup ideas just around that sort of concept um so you know people listening one of the things I would do is just think about the media you consume and then think about how can I turn that media into two-way with AI um I would also think about how do you prioritize uh the things that people are going to pay for you know a lot of people listening to this bootstrap Founders Indie hackers um yeah like there's obviously some consumer media that they they can do but maybe they're interested in more B2B stuff stuff that they can sell to businesses prosumers so with your idea you know that you're you're sort of giving you're talking about right now like how do you think about monetization of it um and how big could it could it be that's interesting I have to think about that I I think I think like the the way that I think about it is new technologies create the opportunity for New Media formats um every new technology like YouTube videos New Media format from the just because the internet right um killing Hollywood um I think uh the and the the thing that is true about this wave of AI is it's taking storytelling and it's making it way cheaper than it has ever been before um and I don't think that that replaces professional storytellers but what it does is it allows you to tell stories in places that was way too expensive previously so like for example I would never hire a really good Storyteller to like go sumarize our meetings for me um but I'll have the AI do it because it doesn't cost me any money um and so looking for places where um uh there are stories to tell that were previously too expensive is like the that I think that's the total addressable Market of this sort of idea and then in terms of charging for it we've been we've been thinking about this because like uh like our strategy is like everything we incubate we bundle it into the every subscription um and but we've been thinking to ourselves like okay for something like this like would people pay more for it and if so like how do we charge for it Qui ad break let me tell you about a business I invested in it's called boring marketing.com so a few years ago I met this group of people that were some of the best SEO experts in the world they were behind getting some of the biggest companies found on Google and the secret sauce is they've got a set of technology and AI that could help you out rank your competition so for my own businesses I wanted that I didn't want to have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I didn't want to depend on ads to drive customers to my businesses I wanted to rank high in Google that's why I like SEO and that's why I use boring marketing.com and that's why I invested in it they're so confident in their approach that they offer a 30-day Sprint with a 100% money back guarantee who does that nowadays so check it out highly recommend boring marketing.com I think like the thing that that that that I think would would sort of work for I mean for the for the podcast idea maybe for the voice mode idea or voice note idea is like on number of downloads or plays or listens because like that's the that's the amount of value that's being gotten out of this thing and uh and so and it scales nicely with the scale of the organization um so I think that's a cool way to do it but I don't know yeah I mean I think yeah people are tired of uh subscriptions you know you know what I mean like I I don't know about you I see like a999 subscription and I'm like or even if it's like yeah $10 $5 $3 I'm kind of just like ah I know I'm going to forget to cancel this you know what I mean so I think we're all kind of collectively got to this point where we're we're we're getting sick of it um so I do love and and you know this I do love kind of more novel ways of monetizing yeah I think and I think that's a new sort of Trend in the AI pricing realm is um not charging per month but charging like per successfully completed task or something like that yeah um and I think I think that's going to work really well cool I mean it's an interesting this is an you know this is an interesting prompt I would say this this idea um curious what people like in the comment section come up with so drop it in what's your what's your next idea my next idea um is called n of one the the basic gist is it is you know are you familiar with kaggle no so kaggle is this like um uh it's this uh basically like market for data scientists where you can post a data set and a bounty and then have data scientists like fulfill the Bounty um and like sort of win the prize with your data set so like an example is like the you know like the Netflix um the ne Netflix challenge where they were like we'll give a million dollars to anyone who can like improve our our recommendation algorithm of course that was OG yes I remember I remember that um yeah so that's really cool well I think the really interesting thing now is a there's way more interesting data sets that are like all personal ones and B everyone's a data scientist because like everyone anyone can just like prompt tune like gp4 to like find some like do something interesting with the data set so it's a platform to um post your own data sets uh whether that's like a personal one or a business one and then uh and post bounties for anyone to make predictions that are useful for you about the data set so the place that it came from is for me um I OCD um and what I think is really interesting is I think we're getting to a place where if I uh take whoop data and probably some amount of like voice and face facial movement data um I I'm pretty sure I've been working on this but I'm pretty sure I can get um I can get it to label whether or not I'm having symptoms and at any on any given day and if it can accurately label that my next question is like can something predict when I'm going to be symptomatic or not um and so what I'm going to do is or what I want to do is basically like post a big data set of you know all like all of my Biometrics and whether or not I was having OCD on that particular day and uh and then post a bounty and have you know it's like 10 10K for anyone who can predict my OCD um and um and then I think if that works and I think it will then I can get people like you or like anyone else who has like an interesting problem like that to like post their own bounties and share it with their audience and like sort of start to bootstrap a little bit of like a a market there and the reason I think it's interesting is uh one OCD sucks and be really fun if someone could predict it for me but two is um it's a new way of doing science actually um because the the way that like science proceeds right now is like you're trying to find like underlying underlying explanations for things by like doing high-end studies on like lots and lots and lots of people and like doing like a linear regression to like understand like how like how things work at a group level and I think instead what we should be doing is um uh making predictive models for IND individuals for n of one um that just like solve the problem and just help us like basically predict the problem and and worry about the generalized scientific explanation later um and I think this this is like a platform to do that all right let's get into this first of I I just pulled up uh kagle I realized I've actually been on this website this is a gift because there's probably there's probably tons of startup ideas that you can come up with just by hanging out on KAG right yeah yeah definitely um like just pulling it up right now like looking at the different data sets it says 406,000 high quality public data sets everything from avocado prices to video game sales and then you can there's all these like ready to deploy ml models uh on top of it um it just feels like this is a gold mine for coming up with startup ideas it definitely is and I think the the the important thing is that kagle was built for a time when the people who could do this stuff were people who like had had like phds in data science Y and it's like totally changed now where like you anyone can enter one of these competitions and like do better than a PhD could five years ago um just with gbd4 probably um and so I think that opens up a ton of opportunities I'm looking at check this out so I'm going to share my screen real quick we're going to we're derailing a bit need to show what's Happening Here there's literally uh a data set called open source data for hacker noon startup of the Year votes over 623,000 total votes 30,000 startups 4,000 cities think about what you can do with that data if you're trying to come up with startup ideas trying to sell to startups right totally um yeah I guess yeah what what would you do with it um I would be interested in well I think I think people who are building startups like probably people listening to the show would be interested to know like what what what is this community you know what are people in call it Sydney Australia what what do they find interesting from a startup perspective and then contrast that from Austin Texas and be like maybe there's some interesting startups coming out of Sydney um and in Austin everyone's building AI startups but in Sydney they're building marketplaces and there's actually like a a lot of opportunity to build some Marketplace idea for for Austin that's that's just like one example or maybe there's like a like some sort of like real estate or Community Building play for uh a city that has a surprisingly high density of a certain kind of company right yes yeah yes um so I I love just I think people should just go on kaggle and just look at some of their data sets and just ask them okay here's a random data set what are some startup ideas I can come with it and I think the easiest startup ideas with some of these data sets is database as a service um so I've seen that Trend pop up more and more Das database as a service MH which basically what does that mean it's a fancy way of saying you're taking some data you're C curating the data you're putting a pay wall against it you're putting a stripe link and you're selling it often to um to social audiences so either organic You're Building Twitter account Tik Tok you're paying creators to post about it um or or you're throwing some paid ads behind it yeah I like that um cool you got you got you got more [Music] ideas I got plenty of ideas let's keep going um one one like one idea that's sort of like on this like new media format train is um there are I think there's this like social aspiration around the great books it's like Marcus aelius or like play or like Moby Dick or whatever it's like um books that form the like Western Canon people feel like they should have read them but like they're kind of a drag to read in a lot of cases um and and I also think they're actually like really useful like they're really they're really great if you actually can get into them but like you have to kind of be in like an English class or something to like really get something out of it and even then a lot of English classes are like not that great um and what's really interesting about AI is it can make those um those stories available in new formats and in new translations that are like tailored for specific types of people or specific situations um so a really like easy example is you know if you try to read PL like most of the most of the pl translations are like really trying to like get the historical like what what would be like the right word like like the historical context right and they're not really like trying to make it like engaging and interesting for a specific you know for like someone who's in in their 30s speaks English like is into Tech right like they're just that's just not on their mind um and I think you can basically create new versions of great books um that are like translated specifically for particular types of people are super easy to read are super engaging and you can even do it in like a multimodal type way where you do like like you can have a a Playdoh movie where you watch a like a platonic dialogue and it's like it's probably mostly AI generated but like probably you need like an Editor to like put it together but I think you can like create a new great books library where you can consume these outof copyright books in um really digestible translations in audio and video formats and even maybe like you can add some you know advanced voice mode interactivity type stuff and I think one there's tons and tons and tons and tons of students that like need to like read this for school and there are all these like sites like Cliffs notes or whatever or spark notes that like are just so last generation um and I think that market is like very capturable and then two uh I just think that there's like a lot of people who are kind of in the like business like in intellectual space that I would I would probably like put myself in the stuff that we make it every in that that place um who aspire to like be familiar with that Canon who would like pay for this so okay question question before I get into this would you sell like sell these books like How do you how do you monetize it I would um I would probably sell either like oneoff access or a subscription and or um I would create a like beautiful physical version this is more less for the students and more for the like business thing I would create like a really beautiful physical version that I would charge a lot for and then have a companion like digital version that like can help you kind of like get into it and like you know gives you commentary or or or you know you can listen to it or you can watch it or whatever as like a um yeah a digital component that makes it easier to consume but I think I think books I think like books started out as luxury goods and then because of the printing press they became like there was this push to make them cheaper because you needed ways to get more information into people's hands and they're no longer necessary as um as cheap forms of like information dispersal because we have the internet um and I think that they need to go back to being really well be well-made beautiful like luxury goods and that you charge a lot for and I think that's maybe that's a slightly different idea but it's like I think that's a great business yeah I mean it's a great business CU it's repeatable it's a good customer base that you can Char you know you the lifetime value is High um shh don't tell anyone but I've got 30 plus startup ideas that could make you millions and I'm giving them away for free these aren't just random guesses they're validated Concepts from entrepreneurs who built $100 million plus businesses I've compiled them into one simple database compiled from hundreds of conversations I've had on my podcast but the main thing is most of these ideas don't need a single investor some cost nothing to start I'm pretty much handing you a cheat sheet the idea bank is your startup shortcut just click below to get access your next cash flowing business is waiting for you it could be a business of one re realistically um maybe with some contractors um spark notes and and and Cliff Notes I was just I was just perplexing uh them to see like what their revenue is it's it's private they they they don't say what it is but both I think they they sold think I was that one of them uh got acquired by cliffnotes got acquired by idg books for $14.2 million in 1998 so you got to think that these businesses are I mean 1998 was like hundreds of years ago that's a lot of money it in224 yeah exactly so you got to think that you know these businesses are making millions of dollars a year um so I I I I you know I tend to think think that the more interesting idea is like the luxury piece of it yeah and the prompt being like what's something that's not luxury today that could be luxury um is really interesting and then if you can use AI to go and create that thing then you're looking you're looking good yeah I think and I think the the the the place to look or the way to ask that question is um I think there's this there's an interesting effect where as technology makes things cheaper the things that they end up making really cheap um end up becoming luxury status Goods So like um an example would be like Broadway right like plays were like the and musicals and stuff are like the way that people would like see live see enter like see entertainment in a lot of ways they were they were very cheap a long time ago everyone would go um and now it's like because we have TV and phones and whatever like you go to Broadway and it's like a special special special night out that's very expensive um so it doesn't go away it just gets less popular and becomes more of a more of a luxury good and I think um I think that Trend will continue with AI stuff so I look at what is AI making cheaper and then look at what like that thing will become more expensive just for a smaller percent of the population yeah and it becomes more like a status symbol it's like oh I'm going to Broadway I'm going to play right yeah yeah or I have a handmade shirt artisanal you know like that people you know this shirt is super cheap but like people pay a lot of money for like something that's handmade yeah also you know limited edition things there's only hundred versions of that t-shirt um so if you're listening to this like this is we gave you we gave you a gold mine before but this is a gold mine because I think like luxury limited edition AI generat stuff um you know it's it's in our nature to always to to think about let's build things for the masses it's like you know I'm wearing a Kirkland t-shirt under here you know um the the epitome of you know to the masses um and I love it but you know I don't feel special when I wear it you know what I mean so feeling special status luxury a lot of opportunity I would I would revise that slightly which is like all I I think all that is true except I think in this specific space um you need to like key on like human-made and handmade rather than AI made and that's the thing that that gives it status um like a good example is like I like this watch right like this watch isn't that expensive but like watches are get really expensive and this is like more expensive probably than it should be um and it's because it's like a handmade thing and what is it what kind of watch is it oh it's it's a Zen this is this is like this is not like super ball or anything like that but it's I it was I think it's a Zen it is a Zen but it's not a Zen like not not what you're thinking s i NN um it's a it's a German brand got it um I had to say someone else is you know gonna be like you let him say Zin but you didn't question him on it you know um the the nerds will know what I'm talking about um yeah uh so but like you know I could tell the time for a lot cheaper than this um or like it's on my it's on my phone you know like I don't need to have this I just think it's cool um and that's because it's like uh it's it's crafted it's like it's a thing it's diff it's different from like the sort of like mass-produced like everyone has it thing um yeah there you go um and so I I think there's always room for that and it's it's easy to overlook it in the kind of like AI technology race but like it it creates more opportunities for those kinds of things yeah I agree I think uh so there's a really interesting Trend that's happening right now which is a lot of college students are anti- AI have you been seeing this no yeah really really it was surprising at first um because I was like thinking like oh come on like early adopters right yeah um but turns out that a lot of them uh for for a variety of reasons if if you actually do like do some market research like they're just they they tried chat GPT year and a half ago it wasn't as good as it is now um they are are are entering a job market that's highly competitive and they're worried that the junior jobs are going to AI so they kind of just see it as like you know oh I don't like this thing because like it might I'm competing gains it all that to say there's a huge opportunity to build anti-i products just in general yeah or like I have this I have this uh I'm not being paid for this I have this thing called the called the brick um which you've probably seen on the Instagram ads and I really like it like it just locks me out of my phone I tap it it locks me out of my phone I leave it somewhere and then I can't get in my phone um and I'm an investor in Light phone um it's sort of like a you know weekend phone that doesn't doesn't have all the smart stuff in it and um yeah I think I think that's a huge thing I did not know about the anti- aai thing I thought I thought it was really big for like doing your homework um so I'm surprised to hear that yeah it is surprising yeah what the the what I've heard recently um I was at a dinner last night and it wasn't about college students but it was about kids and voice mode and um that voice is becoming this like really really natural interface for that generation of like let's say like three to like 12 year olds um specifically because even before chat gbt because um parents didn't want to give their kids phones for obvious reasons um and so the compromise position was uh an Apple watch um and the thing that an Apple Watch has is like obviously like the screen is like it's really hard to do anything on the screen so kids just figured out how to like get them like the absolute max out of Siri like they're just like Siri Masters and um and uh and and now with advanced voice mode like even kids who like can't really read yet they can interact with advanced voice mode and they can just spend hours and hours and hours asking question after question after question um and advanced voice mode will like answer in a way that like an adult like would probably just get tired you know um and so there's a lot of like there was just a lot of ation last night about um uh whether we're kind of like entering a new like oral culture where you're going to do a lot more interacting with computers and everything around you in in in voice instead of in text um I think that's a really interesting thing to think about and I think in particular if you think about starting businesses thinking about voice first interfaces is a really interesting place to explore we've already kind of talked about that a little bit but but like just as a as a broader theme I feel like that'll be way more prevalent soon so yes I agree and I also think that like if all these kids grow up and they're and they're you know they're used to voice they're going to want to continue using voice even you know right they're just G to be used to it it's gonna be natural so look at I would say like what's the opportunity what's the startup opportunity looking at Discovery engines like content Discovery engines like for example maybe that maybe the voice first version of Expedia is a huge opportunity you know Expedia let just check their market cap $24 billion company and it's like yeah could you get 1% 2% 5% of Expedia just focusing on voice first and making it for voice first like not crazy yeah I wonder like what the what the features of a particular kind of product are that make it more likely to be good like better voice first right like um for example like I always get like annoyed at like ivrs like those phone systems because like they list like 15 options and then I can't remember all the options um whereas like if I'm having a conversation with someone I can like pretty much keep the conversation in my head so there's something like that for like that th that kind of dynamic like a more conversational Dynamic is better for Voice versus like I don't know like Logistics or something like that maybe is like not as good you know because you have to you have to hold all the like stuff in your head I don't know yeah uh it's a good it's a good question you know I I got to think about it I think um you're right though like voice voice does you know lend itself to certain spaces better than others um I also think that one thing I was thinking about is like how do you integrate with Siri like you can integrate with Siri right um I don't know I think that you can you can like make it available as an action on Siri or something like that but I don't really honest I don't really know yeah well what I think what matters is as a lot of these platforms grow Siri Alexa chat GPT a lot of them are adding voice there's going to be ways for developers to to embed themselves into that workflow and if you could be known as The Voice version of XYZ assuming that that audience of people really want to use voice and it and it lends itself well to it like there's a lot of opportunity there um and you know someone's going to be listening to this and they're going to say oh but Expedia could add voice at any time right and it's like yeah you could have said the same thing about mobile you know there was a whole generation of mobile first companies that came out created literally trillions of dollars of of market cap and value and it happened because there was an opportunity from a ux perspective to create something that was just really really dialed in for that use case and for that ux the same is true with with voice yeah I mean I I just think that whole thing like there was that whole thing of like for the last couple years of like oh yeah every big company's just GNA like integrate Ai and like no startup's going to be able to compete and it's just like pretty much all of those Integrations suck like maybe maybe a couple of them are okay you know um but really it's a totally new paradigm and like way of using computers and the uh like big companies are really Limited in the risk of the amount of risk that they can take to like make their actual interface good for that specific thing because they can't risk like pissing off their regular users and that's a tremendous Advantage for startups to like actually figure out what the future of this is like and start with the early adopters of people who really want to use it that way and then slowly just get into the mass market after that totally okay I want to end with one last thing which I I don't I don't prep you with anything so um you're you're out there you're building AI apps um you're getting traction on them how do you think about distribution for those apps How should people how should someone who's building an AI app think about uh you know getting their first thousand 10,000 25,000 users uh well this is a this is quite a layup because uh I just send it out to my newsletter um basically like I spent 5 years building a media business um of people that like are really like really engaged and hopefully like really really love the brand and really love the the writing and the videos and all that kind of stuff that we that we put out and so when we have an idea like this um we can just push it out to those people and we pretty much immediately get like you know hundreds two thousands of people try it on the first day um which is really amazing and I I think um the things that I've learned about that that have been really useful is I and everyone else at every like we basically write about things that we care about um that we genuinely like that are about things that are sort of like in our lives or things that we think about and that has it attracted an audience of people who are like us and sort of have a lot of the same characteristics um and that allows us to I think one of the interesting things about the AI wave right now is it sort of resets the plan field where there's a lot of loow hanging fruit of things to build and so it becomes uh that that's a real opportunity to build things for yourself that like was not true a couple years ago because all the lwh hanging FR had been picked and everyone had built their like I built this for myself app um and so what's been really nice for us is like we build things for ourselves and then we have an audience of people who are like us so they probably want it um and that becomes the like first you know thousand 5,000 10,000 user and then um obviously like that that runs out and you have to like scale from there but like that's that's how we think about it uh is actually distribution first and then build something second yeah and then you know once you have your first users then you can do some product Le growth stuff like it could be like okay how I've got a thousand daus how do I get these people to share this and maybe it's like incentivizing them for like a free you know free three months or six months or maybe it's you get access to these early features to share or maybe it's you know come to this event in New York for you know so I think uh Every Which you guys you guys cover like Ai and startups right and stuff like that so I think like everyone should be thinking about creating their own version of every right so what is the media what is the media distribution arm um for whatever it is you're creating um I actually tend to think that like and I'm curious your thoughts on this like I I don't know if I would you know in 2025 start with like essentially a Blog and a newsletter as as the way to get traffic like why why why do you recommend starting there that's a good question I actually I was not thinking about that from like uh what I would do in 2025 it's a really interesting one um definitely like we got lucky cuz when we started every it was like right before the big substack wave and so we got a lot of subscribers and like that was the whole thing and I do think that like email is just really powerful to have um but it's much harder to grow a newsletter now than it was five years ago I'd probably start with YouTube actually um I think and funnel people into from YouTube into a newsletter um that feels like the right move um and we have a YouTube channel and it's growing really fast and it's it's been really great it's like it's definitely a little bit less effective to like get a YouTube subscriber to like read an email like that that conversion is not not nearly as good as it was like back in the day in like old Twitter you know the Heyday of substack um but uh yeah I'd probably start with YouTube yeah I'm honestly I'm I gotta say I'm subscrib I'm I'm subscribed no I'm surprised that how many people subscribe to my newsletter via the YouTube description like I put like a little lead magnet greenberg.com which is where yeah people sign up and I literally get hundreds of people per day wow coming and signing up to the newsletter from that and the cool thing what you can do uh on kit.com formerly known as convertkit is you can segment those people so you can say okay here's all the people that came from YouTube and and you can even do it so here's all the people there's ways to do it so here's all the people that came from this video so um there's really interesting ways to segment your audience so that you send out uh invitations to the app to the right people right time because you know it's not just about getting users to your app it's about getting the right users initially because you like the insights the feedback that you're going to get from them um the fan base the community that you're going to build like is important and uh so anyways I like I like I like your style Dan I like your style thank you great great minds think alike yeah um Dan thanks for coming on um besides every uh is there any anything else you want to plug definitely I mean obviously subscribe to every e.to um if you're interested in some of the products we build uh you should check out spiral uh which helps automate uh a lot of your uh repetitive creative work like doing tweets and Linkedin posts and YouTube descriptions and all that kind of stuff that's spiral. computer and you should also check out Sparkle which is another product that we built that um automatically uh organizes your file system with AI for you um and that's makeit sparkle. Co cool and yeah I encourage people to check it out have fun and just see see like how Dan's thinking about shipping these these products you know and and and how he's building it uh it'll give you inspiration and and uh it's just cool to see um if you like this episode you didn't like it until you click like on YouTube of course uh that's how I know um to keep making videos keep making podcasts uh I'll see you in the comment section Dan thanks again for coming on I'll see you around see you later [Music] Downy

1) The SECRET to mastering AI tools?
Become a product manager first, builder second.

Most people fail because they're terrible product managers, not because the AI tools are bad.

You need clear specs, user flows, and feature definitions before prompting.

2)Think like a Product Manager:
• Define market & customer
• Document decisions
• Create clear requirements
• Map user flows
• Understand value prop

"Don't assume the model knows. The models are dumb. YOU are the one who needs to know."

3) Web fundamentals are crucial. Every SaaS has 3 key parts:

• Frontend (what users see)
• Backend (business logic)
• Database (where data lives)

Understanding this helps you prompt AI tools effectively and debug when things go wrong.

4) Backend-as-a-Service is the game changer 

Tools like Supabase and Convex handle the hard parts:
• Authentication
• Database management
• Security
• Scaling

Pick based on your needs:
- Convex = best for real-time
- Supabase = best for Postgres

5) The future is INTEGRATED tools

Tools like Lovable are winning by:
• Direct Supabase integration
• One-click auth setup
• Automated database config
• Built-in security

Other platforms will follow - the barrier to building is dropping FAST.

6) The new moats aren't technical:
• Design
• Distribution
• User Experience

Building is getting commoditized. The winners will be those who:
• Understand their users deeply
• Create amazing experiences
• Master distribution

7) PREDICTION: Within 12 months, we'll see:
• More integrated solutions
• One-click everything
• Template marketplaces
• Automated security

"We're entering the era of non-technical multi-million dollar founders with no CTO"

The future belongs to product-focused builders

this was a really special episode I had Ras Mike on and we teach you he teaches you how to get the most out of AI to build your SAS startup and we actually go through a new tool called lovable uh which not many people have talked about but we teach you how to use lovable to go and create a SAS startup in minutes but also one that people will love you're going to enjoy this episode it's an absolute [Music] treat all right special episode Ras Mike is back you asked he's back and what are we talking about today man you know I feel like family at this point so thank you for having me Greg but today I think we want to get a little bit in the weeds and talk about how to get the best out of these AI tools and models because every single day they're getting better but are you getting better on how to use them and that's what we're going to be talking about yeah and I think I think people should stick to the end for this one just because this is this is what people need in order to get the most out of these tools so I'm sure a lot of people have watched some of our episodes even and have been struggling with some of these AI tools but I think what you're going to teach them today is going to just sober them up a little bit and give them what they need to actually get the most out of it so without further Ado Mr Ros Mike thank you Mr Greg I appreciate that so one of the things that um if you've never worked like a big corporate job on the tech side um one of the things you'll realize is how a lot of these companies work and maybe I'll draw I'll scribble my thoughts um often time like let's say there's this big product that the team or the company wants to build and usually the relationship looks like this on one side you have uh product de uh product managers right the people that everyone wants to make fun of on Twitter and then you have the developers right and believe it or not product managers don't just you know film Tik Tok videos doing day in the Liv they they actually are an important part of the organization where they Define certain things right so let's say a feature is going to be built if a feature is going to be built believe it or not in most organizations the developers are not the creatives right we sort of get told what to build now we'll give input uh we give you know like feedback but most of the time it's the product manager that's going to give us the product spec what it needs to look like right the product person will either work with like maybe a ux person so there'll be like a ux team here right there'll be a ux team here and then maybe there's like some business people in suits who are over paid here that are going to tell us what to do right we'll just do business here so but the product person takes information from all these people all the needed assets all the needed information combines it together and distills that information to the developer right so what does you know what what's needed in the feature right um if some of you are product people watching you're familiar with a PRD which is a product uh road map or development road map or PDR whatever the term is called and basically this information is then handed over to the developer the developer will have questions but at the end of the day if the information is good enough the developer can successfully build this and I experienced this on a day-to-day I work with great product people and I realize Greg that a lot of people are um are LED down by the AI tools hallucinating or giving them the wrong thing and that's because most people are terrible product managers if you frame your yourself as you know when you're typing in the AI model that you are a product manager you're you're I hope your mind shifts because giving it one prompt saying oh build this for me and then expecting it to build exactly what's in your mind is what we call daydreaming right so one of the things that I really want to communicate and Greg I would love your feedback is collecting all the information that you need what kind of flows do you need what what uh features are you trying to build what even is the core product you're trying to build right right if you don't have these things figured out and you're just going to prompt your way to success unless you have um the highest subscription for any AI tool you're just going to burn credits right so I really encourage people going back to this part is knowing how to write knowing how to define uh features with extreme precision and studying product and I I say this because I've worked with I work with great product managers now but I've worked with terrible ones and there have been times where requirements have been given to us developers and we've literally built the exact opposite of what they were thinking because they didn't communicate what they were thinking properly so don't assume the model knows the models are dumb they're trained on thousands of lines millions of lines of code so they can sort of predict what you're exactly asking them but they don't know you are the one to know and that's one of the I think best ways to get the best out of your AI uh tools you need to be a product person now and Greg I don't know if I just rambled for a few minutes but hopefully that sort of made sense dude can I just share my screen I know this is Off Script please at my last company I I raised money by this guy named Josh Elman and people who in Silicon Valley know Josh Elman he was like one of the first product managers of LinkedIn Twitter Facebook like you you know he's he's kind of like ask ke beer who's the best product manager he'll be like Josh Elman and he has this really good presentation around what is a product manager do and I'm going to I'm going to fly through this within 90 seconds just so people get a sense of like what a product manager does um well what does a so this is old right what doesn't a product manager do write code right um so that's going to change um but a lot of the a lot of the Frameworks here still make sense so what does a product manager do Define define the market and customer launch timing sales and marketing uh collateral Define the problem and value proposition competitors products and capabilities Define the requirements and road maps that's what you were talking about the PRD product requirement document internal external stakeholder communication this is more important for bigger companies but still matters product evangelist and Champion so and then more simply it's kind of the intersection of where ux Tech and businesses that's what that's what a product manager is um I'm going to keep going through this so uh one of my favorite Parts here where is it in real okay you know basically it's you're the life of a glorified notaker some people think the job of a product manager is glorious in reality the most important thing you do is document decisions follow-up notes usually take longer than actual meetings um so I think that you know I'm just scrolling through this you need to learn people need to learn how to become a great product manager and it's a lot of these Frameworks around like advocating for the user how to communicate how to how to take notes um you're not don't think of yourself I I don't think of yourself as an engineer as a builder I think of yourself as a product manager first and then a builder second quick ad break let me tell you about a business I invested in it's called boring marketing.com so a few years ago I met this group of people that were some of the best SEO experts in the world they were behind getting some of the biggest companies found on Google and the secret sauce is they've got a set of technology and AI that could help you out rank your competition so for my own businesses I wanted that I didn't want to have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I didn't want to depend on ads to drive customers to my businesses I wanted to rank high in Google that's why I like SEO and that's why I use boring marketing.com and that's why I invested in it they're so confident in their approach that they offer a 30-day Sprint with a 100% money back guarantee who does that nowadays so check it out highly recommend boring marketing.com so yeah I mean that that's perfect right um I definitely do think great product people will be great users of the models uh just because again i' I've seen a lot of people like write oh create a to-do list a SAS business for me like what does that mean right like how many pages do you need is there an accounts page is there going to be authentication so all these things are very very much necessary and thank you for you know confirming my my thesis on this uh with that slideshow now the second thing I think that's going to help people with getting the best out of AI is just understanding the basics of the web and I I I I don't mean learning how to code and all that stuff although you know I'm a big fan of coding I love writing codes and I think if people gave it a shot they would actually enjoy it but that's not what I'm trying to share essentially what I think is it's very important to understand like what technologies these tools use um right off the bat like I can already tell you um bolt for example bolt. I know there's a lot of people's favorite uses react plus v off the bat right so whenever you start off a new bolt app it uses react for the front end and V is like the compiler the one that builds the app if you use uh v0 which uh recently launch deployments which is pretty awesome uh VZ uses nextjs under the hood right so like what are what's nextjs what's react what are these tools and a lot of people you might hear a lot of people talk about superbase as a database provider right what does super base even mean and I think having a basic understanding of these things can help and that's I'm here to break down so in the web there are three big like sections of the web right like of a proper website SAS whatever you want to call it there's a client side a server side and a data storage side pretty simple stuff the client side is what you see so when I go on uh my portfolio C rosic doxyz what I see this is the client this is the front end right so this is where the user interacts this is your website and then the server is where all the fancy math apis business logic and all that stuff happens and then your database is where all the data stored right so if a user signs up if let's say I have a can band board and I create my to-do list that information needs to be stored and has to be associated with my username so when I log out and then I log back in that same data is there persist persists that's what a database is for so this three block system is what creates a functional SAS I bring that up because having this understanding will help you identify where things are going wrong when you're prompting your models and here's why a lot of people are good at going to a model like for example I can go to vzer and say uh create um landing page for a lawn moing business if I spelled mowing wrong I apologize to my English teacher but so while VZ is prompting what I wanted to show you is right now what I prompted essentially what VZ is going to do is going to work on the front end because I gave it no instructions on what to do on the back I did not tell it we need authentication I did not tell it we need payments I did not tell that we need a database so most people start off with a prompt like this and yes it's writing some fancy looking code but all I'm going to get is an AI generated landing page and that's because I just worked on the front end so it's very important that I understand the difference between what a front end is a backend is and a database is but here's a perfect Here's the the the the crazy part of where we where we are in a society as a tech ecosystem you have companies that are called and Greg I'm sure you're familiar with this companies that are called backend as a service meaning front end is generally considered to be easy though it's not but backend is the is the difficult part you need to worry about security you need to worry about scale I had a startup one time during 2023 a web3 startup um it grew so much that the backend uh the the application we built was not built for scale so it literally broke like it it PE people cannot access it right but we moved over to a backend as a service and guess what they started they handled scale they handled all the users they handled all the fluctuation and a lot of people know these back in as a Services you have a super base you have a slepton one and and Greg maybe bring them on the Pod because they're a great team and their tools amazing a convex these tools basically what they allow you to do is they build out your database so if we go back to my drawing they build out your server and they build out your database and all you kind of have to do is worry about your client and what your client calls um on the server and the database and I know it sounds like I'm saying a bunch of mumbo jumbo but really what a successful AI tool Builder is going to do is they're going to identify okay what am I going to do for my front end so this landing page that I just built on v0 that unfortunately broke let's click fix there uh oh um so people are going to need to identify okay what does my front end look like being a product uh manager but then what backend as a service do I use do I use superbase do I use convex or do I use whatever is out in the market right I think these two are the best ones and I enjoy both and basically what this allows you to do is you now have the ability through these tools to build a full stack application because an application is not just a landing page you need authentication user needs to be able to sign up you need a database data needs to be stored you need payments people need to pay you I hope you want to get paid and having this Frame of Mind understanding that there's a front end that you have to worry about there's a backend in a database you have to worry about there's authentication that you have to worry about is important to know but more than that it's important to pick which tool you want to use for the job and this is why I wanted to talk about uh Greg before I get into it lovable which is a new tool you know a new AI developer tool uh development tool but what's cool about lovable is they have super base integrated so it takes one prompt to get your backend set up it takes one prompt to get your database set up it takes one prompt to take your off set up but I guess before we get into the building stuff did that kind of make sense or did I just Yap technical tget no that it makes complete sense I you know maybe this is two in the weeds but when you're building something how do you think about using super base versus convex like they're both such great plat you know platforms so how do you how do you know what to pick yeah so it it definitely is going to get in the weeds because generally they're both great at what they do now convex wins when it comes to real time stuff right so if you wanted to build a chat application or something where real time like you need some sort of real time notification or you're building some sort of like collaborative tool and you need people to see what other people are doing I think convex wins not that superbase can't do it but convex by default is uh real time so anything you do with convex you get the data real time which is great but there are people and this might be too technical who might need a postgress database right that that's the main database that superbase offers and they're the best at that no one does postgress the way superbase does in terms of DX developer experience especially right so it really depends on the application the user building the best way I would I would say for someone who might not be as technical as your average developer is I would ask an AI model I'd go on chat jpt Claud and be like this is what I'm trying to build and I I know there are these two backend as a Services which one is better for my specific use case there might be one where convex is better and there might be one where super base is better but generally speaking both are great Solutions beautiful all right let's uh let's go into dare I say the uh the the vzero killer the bolt killer the uh the brand new what everyone's talking about lovable yeah and I think we're going to get more of these because YC just keeps funding a lot of these uh tools so that really means one of these is going to explode and I think if someone spends time on the core fundamentals whatever AI tool ends up winning you you'll be a great Builder with it right so let's you know let's start let's build I don't know um I don't want to get too crazy but let's build maybe um any ideas Greg something simple that's not too monstrous um could I mean I don't know how monstrous this is but what about like a not taking tool okay um I want a not taking tool for Founders I want to build a not taking SAS for Founders okay now there should be a user authentication there should be a nice clean landing page explaining why founder need my SAS and will and I'll just end it here and we'll continue from here main thing that I wanted to show is this super base button right here and this is what makes it powerful they have a direct integration with superbase meaning the AI models are well trained on setting up authentication with superbase uh setting up your database tables with superbase which is pretty difficult if the AI models are not very um knowledgeable inset tool but the the way the future is going it seems to me that a lot of these tools are going to be integrating directly with a lot of these backend as a Services right so a lot of the stuff that people are trying to learn right now in my opinion ends up being redundant in the next couple months which is why everybody's asking for a course but I'm not doing it because the tools are just going to get better but one thing that you can teach yourself now that will matter in 6 months a year two years 3 years 5 years whatever is being a great product person being someone who sees a great product and identifies why this is great why the user experience is fantastic being able to write that down and communicate that to a model is where I think the real winners will be not trying to figure out how to integrate superbase with said tool because the tools are going to do it anyway yeah and as an example just I could have said let's build a not taking app that's really cool and the ux is really cool but I specifically said for Founders because like picking the niche being an advocate for the the user is such an important part about of being a great product manager yep yep and I agree 100% And so we have our your founder Journey documented okay I like that so let's click on get started okay it says let's okay I'll just create a random account registration not implemented please connect superbase to enable authentication so I'm going to click here and I've already logged in my superbase account and what I'm going to do is I'm just going to quickly create a new project uh we'll call this YouTube and YouTube Greg and I'm going to create a new project so this is me using superbase and this is how I know they have a direct integration that click took me directly to my account and once I go back if I click here I notice that it says inactive project I have to wait I believe a couple seconds so we'll just let that set up shh don't tell anyone but I've got 30 plus startup ideas that could make you millions and I'm giving them away for free these aren't just random guesses is they're validated Concepts from entrepreneurs who built hundred million plus businesses I've compiled them into one simple database compiled from hundreds of conversations I've had on my podcast but the main thing is most of these ideas don't need a single investor some cost nothing to start I'm pretty much handing you a cheat sheet the idea bank is your start startup shortcut just click below to get access your next cash flowing business is waiting for you by the way I was I was kind of like laughing to myself when I saw it it's just like a button to integrate super base cuz like I had flashbacks to being in CS school and in 200 uh like8 and this stuff was like we had to do the hard work back then yeah yeah no it's it's it's definitely like it's it's it's easy mode like honestly like even as a developer like a lot of developers are like like panicking that oh AI is going to take my job but like even myself like honestly Greg like with these like with the super based or Comics I can literally build anything in warp speed um because like a lot of the hard stuff they take care of right and you know sure they charge like 20 bucks a month but like if you know how to arbit charge that and make more who cares if you pay 20 bucks a month right um that's a that's cocktail in Toronto Lally literally literally it's it's it's a McDonald's meal nowadays unfortunately um but yeah I think there's a lot of like I know I saw a lot of dudes like like doing like full-blown tutorials like how to integrate super base and stuff like manually and it's and it's difficult if you're not a developer right and I knew I was just like somebody's going to figure out an integration and when I saw these guys that's why I was like okay we have to talk about these guys and so your prediction is basically you know Bol or whoever is going to have these Integrations in the next few months yeah so they're going to have templates and Integrations so Integrations with like these backend as a services and then an integration directly with stripe so setting up payments few prompts setting up authentication whatever few prompts I think the mo for the next couple years cuz and I'm willing to argue this is design design and user experience becomes the Moe um because at the end of the day like if you can make the experience much richer much better and you can actually solve the problem um you know that's that's where you win because it's going to be super easy to build if I were like an advisor to convict or superbase that's the top one thing I would work on and if I was an adviser to these AI tools that's the top one thing I'd work on because that's where people are struggling the most and then if you have like a template Market place like like framer and web flow have where like maybe devs put up some templates on like how to use the different tools together it just it we truly enter like the the the birth of like non-technical multi-million dollar founders with no Tech found with no CTO or anything like that yeah I think the way I see it is I think design is is a huge mode distribution also huge mod so the way I think about it is if you think about like the physical world real estate you know the saying location location location like you know if you're opening a store selling you know coffee mugs uh you wanna you want a place where there's a lot of traffic so have traffic go into your store but then you're so that's distribution then when you're in the store the coffee mugs need to wow you off your feet right they need to get you to take out your credit card that's designed that's user experience and then the actual like building of the store well that's essentially getting commoditized right now a lot of these tools yeah and and so I I I agree with you and and that's one of the reasons why like I actually got a pretty like sick uh job offer um as like a lead front end lead um I didn't take it though and I I felt crazy not taking it at first but then I was thinking about like the YouTube channel and like just like the brand I'm building I like if I were to make a a year and a half bet I'm willing to bet that this would be the bigger like play versus that CU we're entering an area where like you said like a time where like distribution matters like the amount of like subpar companies versus like and good companies that hit me up just for ad it blows me away like um and I even told a friend I was like oh yeah I'm I'm charging this for sponsor and apparently I'm completely being undercharge I'm completely undercharged because I I just don't know the game like that right but I've come to realize think you said design and distribution becomes the biggest mod and I think that's where I'm I'm I'm trying to invest my time in because I kind of have the building part down and let's see if this is done okay I think we should be good all right so now if I go over to demos I see YT Greg is green so that means it's good I'm going to click on it and I'm going to click connect so it says I'm not connected to superbase project to GA gather your database structure tables security settings this may take a moment and again this one action is hundreds of prompts uh that people are using on all these different tools that haven't integrated with superbase which is why I think you know all the other tools have seen this they're probably working on this right now I wouldn't be surprised if next week all of them shipped this and this is why again going back to my main point I know I keep repeating it if you focus on the fundamentals you'll end up being a better Builder so it says okay and I can click on my project dashboard my project is set up um it I can read the docs if I want to it's still working so look what it's saying here it says superbase connected follow the instructions in the chat to complete integration so what are the instructions enable sign up login with options like email password or social login so I have to click here I believe oh no that's the uh URL let me go back is it here no that's not it okay what do I have to do let's see Let me refresh this you can now work fully featur here okay I'm going to ask how do I enable this stuff right here sign up login with options because it's asking I have to enable this how do I enable sign up login with options like email password and social login okay so it's creating my database tables it's writing some role level security it's writing policies so like no one can just tamper with my tables again all of this stuff is is not easy to do not trival especially uh and security like that always keeps me up at night like making sure that you're launching something and you you know you don't have to you really don't have to worry that much about security is a in a huge a huge deal and I I definitely do think as like um like these tools start to get popular that like um there's going to definitely be some sort of like intervention government intervention like they kind of have in Europe where you're going to have to adhere to some sort of like security policy and stuff like that so please do take security seriously especially if you're handling user data like you know I know you Founders are about hustle and speed but definitely take a little bit review security maybe hire someone couple bucks to review the security of your application it definitely goes a long way that being said let's try if this set up please connect okay I've already connected you and let me see what's going on it's still working actually uh yeah it's still working so I guess we got to give it a second sorry for all the dead time oh it's okay this is is a live cooking session you know we show we show it all yeah we show it all in these sessions and I think also one thing that people should should know is like this stuff is like without even without like tools aside this stuff is hard like you know as a developer you'll be stuck on like one bug one feature for so long right so you know there's definitely a part of me that says you know you got to have some grit you you know you have to like you're not going to one prompt get anything to work uh the way it should at least so you know definitely it's one of those things where you just got to push through and persevere okay I don't let me I'm going to interfere um let me just check this okay it won't let me write I'm going to just refresh this let it break okay um I believe what I have to do is I have to go to Project dashboard last time I played with this there was a URL so I think I have to go to Authentication let me see providers and then okay email is enabled so that's all I need I'm going to go back to here and say build out sign up and log in with super base and make it work on my SAS why is it interesting uh is there any way I can kill what it's doing right now cuz I think it's stuck all right so you know what we're going to do Greg I'm going to start a new one cuz this one is just stuck part of the game I'm going to start a new tab it happens it happens folks yep it happens we're going to start with and I I actually did this recently I was building uh what was I building yeah I was building uh like my own little meta react framework um and I broke it the first time and I tried to fix it wouldn't work so I was like I just need a clear M I started fresh so let's just same prompt let's start again by the way the landing page goes insanely hard yeah no they uh you know who I can tell you firsthand they uh they trained off uh the Tailwind site uh if I go to opponents and like whereas like because I remember like I know you know what I mean like like if I go here you see that totally you see that this so yeah I saw that I was like I know that design right um I know that design yeah so okay so it's building out these uh seems to be building on my signup page building on my login page and this is our landing page okay spinning up preview okay not as cool as the first one but we'll take it if I click on start on free trial okay I'll just enter my name my email and then the password if I create create it didn't work that's because we did not integrate with super base so I'm going to click connect here so it says I'm now connected to your superbase project gather your database structure table security settings this may take a moment so we'll give that its moment do you think uh you'll be using lovable in 12 months from now you know I like these tools to quick MVP myself um so like let's say like a client hits me up and I have they want me to build something I will kind of instead of me sitting down and thinking about it I'll kind of just try to build it like a smaller version with like a bolt or whatever and then it kind of gives me an idea of like what I have to do and I kind of take that and then start to refine what I have to do so I don't until these Integrations get solidified I I haven't gone like end to end but it's definitely my tester and something that I Ed to build um nvps with so it says you can now work with fully featured backend and add powerful features to make your app functional user accounts login all the good stuff so now I'm going to say now make the sign up and sign in work using super base I'm going to hit enter and now we should see it create my tables and do what it needs to do to make this work it says please review and approve SQL commands now the reason why it's asking me to review this because SQL is no joke um you can really destroy business writing the wrong commands which is why like you know you can copy this maybe take this over to another model and ask you like what are these commands going to do can you review them um but they look good to me so I'm going to click apply okay so now it says the migration is being applied meaning the tables are created now it's going to implement the authentication UI and functionality in the front end I'll update login and sign up components to use super baseed authentication so it's working on that I think we can even click on this look at the code it wres and yeah it looks pretty good to me so we'll let that do it thing clean code commented yeah that's that's honestly if you ask me what's my biggest usage of heyi is comments yeah because comments really help so it says I've implemented the authentication functionality for both login and sign up Pages for for development purposes you should disable email verification in the super based console to speed up the testing process so if I click here I can disable this if I want to but I won't we're actually going to leave that there and we're going to go back here and I'm going to try to sign up and honestly if sign up works then you can pretty much do anything because that's the hardest part let's create an account success please check your email to verify and I'm going to check my email if I got this let me check while you're checking that did I see like you can sign up with Discord and figma like some pretty obscure ones yeah so there's Apple there's Discord there's Facebook well Facebook figma yeah I don't even know what some of these apps are notion twitch slack Spotify but like that's really cool right like how many people are doing login with figma for found or not taking apps like probably not that many yeah yeah and and and and the thing is it's very like they're not easy like like github's integration is pretty simple but the others are not easy right so the fact that they've abstracted that and just made it an enable disable situation is fantastic that being said ladies and gents I just want to show my email look what I got follow this link to confirm your user so like the the email check even worked which is great so what I'm going to do is I'm going to confirm my account and now what I'm going to do is I'm in the signin page I'm going to click sign in and I'm signed in so the authentication actually worked so what I'm going to do now is I'm going to say create the uh not taking page and make it so that only authenticated users can access it so my authentication Works which is fantastic and again you have all these providers like you know phone there's there's a lot that you can do here and if I click on my users here look at what user signed up that's my email right there that's my name right there I sign up through email what time will last sign it so this tool allows you to build a full um a full signin sign up database integration with superbase few prompts now I told it to make the note taking page and it's creating the tables for the notes because I'm signed in but I'm going to write notes and if I'm going to write notes those notes need to be attached to my username and need to be persistent imagine you write your notes and then the second you log out all the notes disappear that's a terrible application right so it's writing it's building out all the tables I'm going to accept um the SQL queries that it wrote and we're going to wait for it to apply as as terrible as the first like go was this honestly would have been I don't know like 60 PRS with any of the other tools yeah it's funny cuz like after using so many now I'm like starting to get numb with how amazing these things this is yeah no it's honestly like it's it's insane like you know there are boot camps that charge like upwards of $20,000 to teach people this um and you and I are doing it through a few prompts and clicks all right so it says the migrations applied um it's created a new route so let's try this I'm going to click Start free trial okay it takes you nowhere so I'm going to say add a nav navigation bar and when I click I'm going to say add a navigation bar and then I'm going to make this like a list and when I click on start free trial nothing happens if I am signed in it should take me to the note taking page if not it should take me to sign in again this is all just being about a great product person so I noticed that I don't have a navigation bar I should probably have a navigation bar and I notice that when I click on start trial nothing really happens and I want it so that when I click this it takes me to the not taking page if I'm signed in but if I'm not signed in I need the user's information so I I need them to sign me in do you even consider yourself an engineer anymore or are you a product manager you know um there so there's a part of me that although these tools are good if we went if someone who's great at using these tools went against myself or even like there's thousands of Engineers better than me I definitely do think the engineer still has the edge in terms of making the more performant and faster application right because like just looking at how it's written the code I'm not saying it's wrong but I can definitely make it much faster already so I still think in cases like that where speed and optimization is important um I will still I still consider myself an engineer but five years from now I I can't even tell you where this thing is going to go because it it honestly is scary uh but so yeah I have my Navar if I click on profile profile page is empty because we haven't done it anything if I click on notes it takes me to notes tab but then if I click on start trial remember what I told it to take me to the notes tab that's what it does and then it says log out here so I just logged out perfect let's say I want to actually open this on the full screen so I can see the URL paths so let me why is the I don't see the let's go back here what I'm going to do is add the navigation bar in the sign in and sign in and sign up page as well um let's do that so I can navigate back home from the sign in page cuz currently there's there's nothing I can click on I mean I can do that but that's kind of a cheat let's go back to log in have you thought of like investing in any of these yeah yeah yeah I uh yeah TBD you should yeah uh so yeah look at that I can go home I click log in if I click Start free trial it's going to tell me create an account I already have an account so I'm going to log in Click sign in and then that nav part pops up so what I'm going to do is when I sign in take route me to the notes note taking page again this is a big deal because not only do we have like our landing page our Navar and all that stuff but we actually have authentication and it's it's done like we don't have to work on authentication anymore right right now I'm working on the flows right someone signs in it should direct take him to the not taking page so it says it's done that I'm going to click Start free trial look at that and then if I log out and I sign back in takes me to my note page now let's say I write Michael and Greg and I'm going say they are best friends which we are which 100% And I click on create note so it says Michael and Greg they are friends so that note is created now here is what's cool about this if I go back to my super base and I click on table editor I'm going to see notes and profiles if I click on profiles this is my profile I have a user ID here um my my name and then what time I created my account if I click on notes I'm going to see my notes stored in the database but here's the thing it's connected to my user ID right so you see user ID here 7bb if I go here the ID is 7bb so this note is attached to my user id meaning if I log out and I sign back in my note is there ladies and gentlemen you have assass now payments are difficult and I hope they have a strip payment integration but you finally have the ability to create this full remember this full flow I showed you your client your server and your database the hardest part was this right here right especially with authentication and database they've made it super easy the final Beast to conquer is payments and what's cool is they also have deployments so I can deploy this publicly right I'm going to click on deploy and we're going to give that a few seconds while that's deploying one of the things you said was authentication is now done what people miss about authentication is let's say you authenticate with uh figma and figma changes their API for whatever reason you have to like maintain it now you don't have to do the maintenance which is a really big deal that's all on super base right and that's kind of what you use them for so it says my site is published if I click on this I have my not taking app if I click on start free trial it's going to tell me to create an account I already have an account so I'm going to sign in we click on sign in my note is there this is cool and why and this is why you should subscribe and like Greg's Channel and I'm going to say hi this is Mike and if I click on create note the note is created we have our SAS I hope you are entertained hell yeah dude that was great I uh I appreciate that that was that was super helpful um couple couple action item so one is if you enjoy this and you want to learn something else another type of tutorial just comment on YouTube what we should talk about so uh we're always looking for ideas and then Michael often is in the comment section too so he can respond to you as well and number two Ross Mike has a great YouTube channel it's Ras Mike I'll include it in the description highly recommend you guys go and subscribe where he does more more videos like this yep and if you ask for it you shall receive so definitely uh you know and especially in the comments if you have any questions I I said I would respond to every comment last time I couldn't because it was just too many but I will try my best especially if you comment early beautiful all right my man I appreciate you and uh all right let's let's go become product managers yep that's the game thank you so much Greg as always always I appreciate you and thank you everybody for showing love all right later [Music]

Title: Growth Genius Leaks Million Dollar SEO Plan
Published: 2024-12-04 19:50:18 UTC
Description:
Join me as I chat with Jacky Chou, a serial entrepreneur, as we dive deep into growth hacking opportunities. Jacky shares his strategies and frameworks for how to growth hack businesses using SEO and keyword research.

Timestamps
00:00 Intro
01:34 Most AI companies are leaving money on the table
10:52 Paid Ads for InteriorAI
14:51 Jacky's million dollar SEO plan with Reddit
21:01 Other Neglected Platforms to beat VC-funded startups
24:44 Startup Idea 1: NSFW AI O.F. 
35:31 Community Building in 2025

1) Most AI companies are leaving money on the table

Case study: InteriorAI (by Pieter Levels)

- Missing out on ~50K/month
- Could monetize through affiliate content
- Should create blog targeting high-value keywords
- Opportunity for "retail rank & rent" ($1-2K/month per placement)

2) Jacky's million dollar SEO plan with Reddit
- Find keywords where Reddit ranks #2 (tons right now!)
- Share your product as a "user" (no links!)
- Target all related long-tail keywords
- Look at AI-related terms (massive growth)
- Replicate across Quora, Medium, LinkedIn

3) Keyword Research Gold:

"AI video generator" trends:

- Search volume is exploding
- Reddit ranking #2 consistently
- CBC around $1.50
- Huge opportunity for indie hackers
- Most big players ignoring UGC platforms

4) Dark Horse Opportunity: Adult AI Market

- Extremely low keyword difficulty (KD: 2)
- High search volume
- Most competitors doing poor execution
- AI chat + OF management tools needed
- Mid 6-7 figures/month potential
(Not for everyone, but opportunity exists)

5) Community Building in 2024:

- @JackieChou hitting $80K/month
- Built from 15K YouTube subs
- Key: Sell transformation, not just community
- Focus on membership benefits
- Bundle partnerships/tools

Key Takeaway:

To win in 2024: Do what VC-funded startups won't:

- Target neglected platforms
- Create authentic content
- Build real communities
- Ignore "brand concerns" early
- Focus on actual user value

6. Auto-generate everything

One place ID = complete page with images, content & SEO

Pro tip: Let restaurants find YOU through analytics

7) Key Learning:

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
today's episode is really cool it's a tutorial how to use AI to create websites that rank number one on Google with proof and with examples I brought my friend Omar on uh and we just we go right through it it's a it's an hour plus episode but we I'll I'll tell you exactly what you're what you're going to learn so we we go through his two websites that got to a number one search term on Google in 6 months as a side project we talk about uh something called schema which is a way to get extra uh traffic via SEO we we show you exactly how to do it uh we talk about the tools he uses to create these uh websites and landing pages using webflow we talk about how he uses something called appify which basically scrapes things like Tik Tok and Google Maps to get the data that you're really going to need and then we talk about how to use zapier to just bring it all together then we just get into a live cooking session where uh if you watch the whole thing by the end of it you'll have a really good idea on how to create something similar uh in a different Niche this is an episode that people Char would charge thousands of dollars for absolutely free here on the startup ideas podcast I hope you enjoy it and you know what don't waste any time like and comment on it so you get more of this in your feed and uh so that way you can ship amazing products that actually get seen enjoy the [Music] episode Omar what are we getting into today Greg my man thank you for having me man we're going to do some uh AI web flow zapia Claude magic you know we're going to give the people something that they can build themselves you know and I've learned myself so you know why not share it man and on the platform we can so thank you for having me what are they what are people who listen to this entire episode going to get by the end of of the tutorial Wow first of all I have been an avid listener myself you know for for a long time you know I reached out to Greg completely cold um you know and you were very sincere enough to hit me back we had a conversation and since then I've been very you know sincere in our exchanges so thank you for that finally enough actually when I before the before the call I wrote down some notes and the first thing said give flowers and in Brackets Greg so I didn't forget to tell you you know how how you know great you are at what you do and my wife came down and saw my notes and she goes who's Greg and why are you giving him flowers so yeah the the the goal is you know I'm as a viewer and audience member I can definitely connect to why this is important to a lot of you know you guys watching and I think one of the main things is to actually give you tangible tools and resources you can use to build things yourself um and also things that I personally believe that I'm I'm building myself right now I'm doing so I really believe in these tools and techniques there's so many tools out there like zapia clae web flow appify that we'll go through today that actually can help you build very very sophisticated SEO Rich platforms websites um that really and I'll show you some evidence can help you compete with some the biggest in the game like we're competing with Trip Advisor now you know recipes.com all these big big sites um and so hopefully we'll give you some game that you guys can take away and start building some really cool stuff after yeah perfect all right let's get into it cool amazing so what I'm going to do is first of all I'll take you guys through how I think about um SEO U and especially when it comes to AI why I think it's become such a profound why we a very profound kind of time right now um when my when I was growing up my father used to run um one of the largest kind of the online ticket sales businesses right competing with Ticket Master Etc and um he used to hammer money on SEO right like I'm talking like you know 50 100K a month just on Google ads spend it was ridiculous and I'd see that growing up and be like there's got to be a better way but too young to understand and so now that we're in the AI age I think it's even more fascinating that you have these tools and techniques that allow you to compete with such big players but without any you know need for um you know those type of budgets so I'm going to go through a couple of sites that we've set up and how they've been ranking um and then what we'll do is we'll go through a couple of techniques tools that you guys can use to also do that yourself as well so this is one of my sites here called guilty Chef uh so it's basically um you know I'm a I'm a big cooking guy I love to cook um always been like a good hobby and I created this kind of fun little side brand on Instagram where I would like share recipes of what I did um I would cook on camera and kind of put those out every year I'd create kind of these recipe videos and throw them out for fun and you know just make some pocket change and it was a nice little project but then kind of earlier this year I was moving countries to Dubai where I am now uh and I was thinking I can't keep creating these recipe videos all the time but how could you create something using Ai and Technology but you know still allow people to benefit from you know uh recipes and getting like recipes from the best places or at least the favorite restaurants in the world cool so we set up I set up guildy Chef because I thought it'd be you know interesting to see if you could generate recipes using AI um and how good they would be um and then I start practicing them myself and they turned out to be really cool and very very effective so I ended up actually playing around with zapan and webflow and so I'm a I'm a designer kind of you know my skill was mainly kind of uxui that's where I kind of you know uh grew up you know that was a main skill that I was doing for a long time um and so I just kind of put together this layout on web flow and then thought to myself well how can we create thousands of recipes really but with minimal effort um and I was just playing around with chat GPT and asking it how to create recipes from like you know KFC wherever Chick-fil-A like even some of the things that I couldn't get even back in London like Chick-fil-A you don't you don't have there um and so it could just give me the recipe recipes I thought this is fantastic now is there a place online where you can get have recipes from all different restaurants in the world and I couldn't find one so I thought let me just create a site that has a directory of just like you know the best restaurants in the world yeah so we we put together this kind of directory you know we thought there's no kind of place online that has every restaurant in the world and all the recipes on there and I would love to see that myself so I just started building out the directory of like all different restaurants and I just would go through the menu i' Google the menu and then just put in um the menu items and entire pages will be generated themselves so every single page you're seeing here is completely generated automatically using AI down to the image you know and so some of them you can obviously tell it's AI generated image some of them not so much um but description the prep time cook time ingredients the directions um the FAQ all this type of information is all built in um automatically using chat gbt and zapia and so that got me thinking I was like hold on a second well if you can create websites like this and content like this you must be able to get it to you know rank in Google since Google is all about you know links Pages um how can we actually do that and then I started looking at the schema which is obviously you know what Google uses to understand what's in your website so for a recipe website you'd have recipe schema which would actually tell you which would tell Google in its own format you know exactly so you can type in here like you know we go to schema.org oops this is validator we go to schema.org um quick ad break let me tell you about a business I invested in it's called boring marketing.com so a few years ago I met this group of people that were some of the best SEO experts in the world they were behind getting some of the biggest companies found on Google and the secret sauce is they've got a set of technology and AI that could help you outrank your competition so for my own businesses I wanted that I didn't want to have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I didn't want to depend on ads to drive customers to my businesses I wanted to rank high in Google that's why I like SEO and that's why I use boring marketing.com and that's why I invested in it they're so confident in their approach that they offer a 30-day Sprint with 100% money back guarantee who does that nowadays so check it out highly recommend boring marketing.com and you can find different schemas on here so you know you could find like a a recipe schema let type in recipes schema um there you go and so this these are all the kind of um keys that or the properties at least that Google looks for to be on your page to understand exactly what type of content it is so what's a cook time the cooking method the nutritional value um the steps like each how-to step can be defined but that content obviously isn't default baked into your website you have to send that to Google and to do that you have to create something called schema um and then I thought well maybe AI can do that and so it could it turns out AI can write your whole schema for you and you can plug it into your site and I really you can break this down to where I have it now where I can just type in the name of a restaurant and a you know recipe or a menu item I could type in like McDonald's Big Mac that's it and hit enter and literally within a minute the entire page is generated fully designed you know ready to go so okay stop there yeah because this is insane dude oh wow thank you insane because I you know I need to break down what what I think you're doing and and why I think it's so brilliant so what you're saying is you had an idea for this startup you you felt you had a pain Point you're like wouldn't it be cool if I could make my own Big Mac um and so you had the paino you had the idea you're like I'm going to go build a directory and by the way we've talked about directories on the past on the show why is a directory so powerful well a directory is so powerful because people are overloaded with content now and they're looking for curation they're looking for Taste and they're looking for well looking for they're it's seo seo optimized right if you build a directory that is high quality and valuable and people are searching for that sort of stuff you will get free traffic so then what you did is you said okay I'm going to build this to be optimized well first of all you said then I'm going to use AI to create the content which I thought which is obviously brilliant you're not going to go hire a team to go and build this then you go there's something called schemas which will allow me to get more traffic for the same am amount of content which I think a lot of people miss a lot of people create directories but they actually don't they they don't know enough about schemas to actually optimize it so that's what you've done and why I think this is exciting is now you you've built this Hub I'm curious how much traffic you're starting to get yeah go sorry no I was GNA say like once you once you get this thing to to millions of visits a year or a month then you can create all sorts of Premium products that you s can sell to these people man 100% And by the way we've already got a paid part of the platform already so you know you can go in there you can generate your own recipes at the bottom but if you sign up you get three for free but you know you can pay like $2.99 or whatever and get you know another 10 so you can like pay for a pack of recipes you can generate and so there's things like that in there people are creating accounts monetization is not like at the Forefront so we're not driving as much revenue through it you know since we're not pushing it as much but people are definitely curious enough to come on there and create accounts and we'll probably hit uh in December we might go might exceed 100K in monthly traffic and this was basically zero in March this year so I think that's literally like just in the period of last you know seven eight months or whatever and by the way I spend zero time on this Greg like I set it up I probably spend if I already I have my own company and stuff this is a side project so I probably fulltime spent like maybe a week on this um putting it together designing it and then just letting it run spent a couple hours a month over the summer and then now we just sits there and just you know I don't even really add any more recipes I should be so I've been thinking about you know the last few weeks let me try and like you know ify a bit but I'm just more so was like a SEO experiment because I was curious does this thing work um and now we can see yeah is it is it possible to replace you as the recipe prompter um in what sense so right now it sounds like you you're like we should add Popeyes yeah because of XYZ reason maybe it's because popey's recipes 100,000 searches a month or um or you're just like I like Popeyes and I can't get in Dubai therefore I want to go and create my own Fried Chicken so my my question to you is is there possible to create some sort of agent or something that basically looks Bas that basically replaces you that says like your job is to add one new restaurant a week based on these criteria 100% I to be honest you could even do that like it's something like zapia you could do that just by having it on like a time delay so you could just get it to run that same prompt like every week every day so long as a prompt is strong enough and it could just do that by itself and that's effectively an agent um so yeah certainly it's a good idea to be honest it's something worth considering for sure I've just been like you know just micromanaging a little bit but yeah definitely that that'll probably be the smart next step like if you look at it right now even like everything here says 17 because I didn't even fix the numbers of how many there are in in each of them but um yeah so there things like that a great idea cool so so I show how someone yeah go yeah I was going to say like how could someone build something like this you know how can someone do this yeah no for sure so let me just show you a bit of the results and then I'll and then I'll take you down a bit of a a little bit of a rabbit hole of how you can actually literally copy this um so if you see here this is like some of the keywords now they're ranking for this is like a a restaurant called Dum pan tiar for example we're ranking number one um on Google for this right now um you could take so this literally the first organic results it's not sponsored at anything someone t t types in this menu item with a restaurant name guilty Chef is the first one is above Trip Advisor you know which has like a domain rating of 90 or whatever um so you know it works and then you got this one crispy chili mushrooms wager Mama again number one um and they like you know tackle Supreme ingredients this is where schema really is interesting because actually this FAQ here is what ingredients are in taco supreme it picks up the information from our site and repurposes it in the rich Snippets for Google and it's the first result you know just below Taco belt um so it's the very first kind of you know uh question and so it just goes to show you that so long as you in insert the schema correctly effectively what you're saying to Google is here's information that I've I'm providing you and you're providing it to them in the cleanest way possible that it's easy for them to understand and digest excuse the pun um and then you know they can kind of distribute that in a in in a way that benefits you and also you're providing the valuable content that a user is looking for um but there's loads of obviously sites out there that do have recipes on there that have Taco Bell recipes but even when I was looking into it to your point earlier um Greg there's so many people that don't pay pay attention to schema and how they're structuring their site and actually has a massive impact in how they rank and some of the biggest sites by the way don't Implement schema properly um and AI can literally just help you solve that to be honest by itself um so these are some of the results and also so now the other thing that I found really fascinating is if you think about I think good way of thinking about the opportunity we have right now in general with AI is if you look at clae Cloe as you might say chat GPT you know these are effectively you know information machines you know you can ask any question in any format whether you want to write a poem about a recipe or just give you the recipe whatever it is and they can just you know spit it out to you what interesting is that information is coming from somewhere and then the the the kind of the sources that it's getting it from is the worldwide web right it's actually getting it from the internet that's how they have that information in the first place that their models are trained on what I found interesting is actually when you start ranking you're you're kind of taking this content that you've got from chat gbt originally you're repurposing that same content putting it on your site with your label which is your domain name your page and then you're submitting it to Google and it's not only being indexed in Google it's also being indexed back into the AI engines as well and so now when you search like Burger King spicy bean burger recipe for example you know it'll give you the recipe and it'll tell you that the number one source is is guilty Chef you know um and so it's literally we're this same term I could type in seven eight months ago and it would give me a recipe but might been from somewhere else but now based on the SEO and some of these tools and techniques we're doing we're the number one result that chat GPT self is now giving you but yet chat gbt actually gave me this recipe in the first place but the difference now is I'm tagged in it and it's my label and I can also Drive traffic through it via chat GPT and Claude um so I found that pretty interesting and I think that can definitely for directories especially things like we're get into a minute in a minute with like travel and bigger Industries if you're searching for you know best restaurants to visit in Dubai or whatever um you'd want your site to come up number one you know and so you can start thinking about even these AI systems as search engines for you to drive traffic and this is a way that you can do that and you're doing it all in one you're not having to submit anything extra to chat gbt it's all happening from your schema and how how big of a business do you think you can create you know I I I see like the traffic and and the opportunity than traffic but like from a revenue perspective how big do you think it can get I think it depends on the niche um and Industry I think a couple of ideas I've had with guilty Chef I think the the obvious ones would be like you know sponsorships Partnerships whether it be for the restaurants or whether it would be with you know her Brands like Schwarz or you know Brands like that that actually want to you know sell their ingredients to people that are reading recipes it might be worthwhile them doing it or cookbooks that people are selling you know they could be ways to advertise and monetize that way um I also thought an interesting thing might be I don't think this exists yet by the way but like you know you where you have um Facebook's ad platform and you have Google's ad manager Google AdWords I think over time there will be an interesting space where if you're creating content on your site like I have you should be able to I should be able to make money off of someone seeing a specific ingredient and going to that brand so like I should be able to plug in something here and papa automatically have a link that if someone sees and clicks on it there's a brand bidding for that you know even that could somehow be AI powered or whatever so I think there's like interesting kind of um B2B ways of doing that but I also think for consumers with AI you can constantly Elevate the experience and then give them a much better much uh much more value you know having a customer experience where they can customize their recipe more you know maybe they can add like specific diet require requirements which you already can do a little bit in our recipe generator but I think like breaking you know uh building that more and more maybe adding your family into it so it learns your family's preferences so kind of becomes like I do think there will be a world I think a lot of people have said this where you will use specific tools for uh specific AI tools and brands for specific activities so like this could become the go-to recipe tool that people just use because it just knows your family knows everything and could just spit out recipes and you trust the content and quality so I think there's a few different ways you could probably turn into a business in terms of numbers I'd be completely shooting in the dark this is like one big experiment for me as is so I'll let you know when I know I suppose I'm open to your thoughts man you probably have more experience in you know hedging your bets on that than I do yeah I mean for for me I I look at you know how big could could this get I mean the sky is the limit but I think the mistake a lot of people are you know will make with it probably is that they'll start getting a lot of traffic and they'll they'll monetized via like Google AdSense um but I think the the bigger opportunity is go sell software to restaurants you know um like just use this to good point be a powerhub of you know a consumer traffic Powerhouse and then create some software that's going to that you can sell to to the the B you know what is the B2B software that you can create like insights like consumer insites you mean yeah stuff like that I think I I think I would brainstorm what are the you know what's the B2B offerings um the other thing I was thinking about is have you ever heard of URL genius no should I look it up I think it's called URL genius these guys yeah so I haven't used it but I'm pretty sure like the the idea or or maybe it isn't URL genius maybe it is I don't remember it seems some yeah what does it do might be this one Bas basically what I what I would like to do is you know you give the example paprika like how do you automatically have basically affiliate links set up with trusted sources and it just puts it in there you don't have to like worry about it you don't have to like go to Amazon and create the link and then put in the link I think that maybe it's your Genius maybe it's not but I don't know you know that software probably exist and then you can just start monetizing on autopilot that totally makes sense man 100% just like within the content itself right yeah there's probably so many ways that you could do that I'll be a curious to look at that um eurl genius if it is that one I'll have a look if you if you come across a different one let me know man I've been thinking about you know what other the ways that we could do it subtly yeah I don't like the Google ads in your face like no one likes that and I think if you think hard enough and smart enough you can find ways of still delivering a great experience um and I actually think that should be a priority in this this world we're in because there's a lot of Founders or people that have been Founders before as I I've run companies that have become complex unnecessarily right and so I appreciate this world we right now where you know I can be a bit more of a lone soldier because I have so many tools at my disposal which are the equ literally for me are the equivalent of multiple employees who are paid to do the same job before right and so when you're seeing that you can be very Nimble very creative and also you can if you are a Founder that is like design Le or product lead you can actually actually like leaning into that and creating a great experience laid with the AI I think will benefit you profoundly you know I think that's actually your goto Market is like so much quicker now and you can build great experience in entire categories I think sh don't tell anyone but I've got 30 plus startup ideas that could make you millions and I'm giving them away for free these aren't just random guesses they're validated Concepts from entrepreneurs who built $100 million plus businesses I've compiled them into one simple database compiled from hundreds of conversations I've had on my podcast but the main thing is most of these ideas don't need a single investor some cost nothing to start I'm pretty much handing you a cheat sheet the idea bank is your startup shortcut just click to get access your next cash flowing business is waiting for you okay so how how could people how do how do how do they copy what you do yeah so let's close some of these um I'll come on to another example in a minute actually I'll just show you this quick example now just because I'm the example I'm going to show you will relate to this so the second site I set up which I quickly go over which I only up recently is called uh best toy.com and so I saw this domain by the way you know just a couple of months ago and I just snapped it up um it was less than $1,000 I think it was like $700 or no I think about $1,200 which in my opinion was a bargain because if you're looking at first of all Dubai Where I Live Now is like Trip Advisor number one destination in the world for like two or three years running now you know so many people are immigrating here um and it's just incredible in so many ways you know and so what's interesting is the search volume and the search Trends or people searching you know doing things here has been you know increasing a lot and the main key people are using are literally best Dubai like best hotels in Dubai best malls in Dubai best restaurants in Dubai as you would in most cities and so for me the absolute best domain you could get is best dubai.com and it was available at such a bargain like for context if you're doing like Saudi Arabia is picking up now rad and everything going on there if you search bests saudi.com as a domain that's going for like 100 Grand you know and that's probably not as popular as Dubai as a as a as a city right now and so it's very I think it was a great buy and so that made me kind of lean into that and so I bought this domain maybe two months ago and then literally spent like two or three weeks building a directory using the same learnings as guilty Chef the same process that I'll go through with you guys in a minute but now we're doing in a travel space and I think this particularly made me obviously you know uh speak to you about this as well Greg which was uh following your conversation with Shahid um and you guys were talking about travel directories and literally being in that space now and seeing it is absolutely fascinating what you can do and again every single thing you're seeing here is is like AI generated you know down to we've taken a step further than guil to Chef we' actually got scores that are being generated for the places based on the information about them based on their reviews and then I actually got Claude I used Claude in this instance because I thought it was better um CLA to actually write the algorithm for me to do the scoring so I'm kind of just always talking to the AI system itself to get it to actually help me create the best experience possible um and we take like the best times to visit and like you know popular that data here so Lally everything here I haven't touched it like I'm not I could add a place kind of literally within a minute um and then you have if again you go to SEO this is literally only been 30 days old and now like this is a big restaurant here Parkers Parkers du buy you type in Parkers to BU reviews we like the fourth organic link right now and I don't even think it's been a full month that we've been index in Google um and so we're among you know Trip Advisor Amato like the biggest links um and we're not we don't have their marketing budget like trip advisors marketing budget like $700 million a year fun fact actually I just I called email the founder and CEO of Trip Advisor Greg like two days ago and he just got back to me I started giving me advice really cool guy in my um stevenh so yeah he was uh you know a nice big H but again things like that you know you just get in touch with people you know because they everyone into this space they find it exciting so you know you guys can literally tackle entire Industries right now and go straight to the top of like whoever you want to talk to and they'll want to have a conversation with you I think um well I also think that okay so like if I were to create trip advisor in 2025 it probably looks more like bestd by.com than it does tripadvisor.com so when you reach out to CEO of Trip Advisor he wants to talk to you even though you're not that known because he wants to learn from you you're doing you know he wants he he knows that right so I think um it's a really good signal that he responded and he's like yeah let's let's Jam because I think this not only does like I'm like reading this and like the content looks really good but the design looks really clean and it just it looks like a good product like to me this looks I'd rather search this than Trip Advisor thank you man I appreciate it that means a lot man especially from someone like you seeing so many products as well so you know I I I really spent time designing this trying to get it like the way I thought I might want to use a site that I'm here right now I've got three kids and you know we're looking for places all the time and so I literally reverse engineered like what would I be looking for right now um and then literally we've just been iterating you on it as we go like search we just added last week um saved we just added like three days ago you know and so all these things were just like tweaking as we're going but the most interesting thing I think from a business perspective is like you know we have the ability to add like these tags so I've created these categories a bit like Trip Advisor have best choice with the Michelin star why I find that interesting is like they're just brand names really like it doesn't it Michelin you know the whole thing was created to get people to go to restaurants you know and so they in in a grand scheme of things yes they mean something but like you can create your own meaning for something as well and so I think having these kind of tags like Dubai J best 100 and we've actually started speak to restaurants and say hey you've been voted best 100 on best toy.com it holds weight and now we're going to put like physical Awards in their places build the brand that way uh in the city as well and so like you know there's ways to do this stuff that I think you know you can really have fun with the marketing side of it too um cool so yeah so that's basically this site over here um and another fun thing by the way AI that we did is like the the menu so if I just show you this place again by the way Greg um if you go to menu it has an entire menu of the place listed on here um with prices and like designed in there as well and you'd think again I've added that automatically now I haven't and the other the other thing is that there's there's not really an easy way to get um upto-date restaurant um items and pricing because the menus can be out of date like that that are like online might just be images on Google um and secondly they just don't have these type of you know that this type of information on all of their websites yet one of the biggest searches tends to be restaurant name and menu right and so then I kind of thought well where where does have the most upto-date uh menu and obviously is delivery Partners right and so I I worked with Claude and I just got Claude create me a extension for like the two biggest uh delivery services here so we have deliver and tbat and so like I can go right now and type in like Parkers du buy menu deliver for example um let's say the restaurant comes up um and then Claude helped me just write this Chrome extension which I can just hit extract menu and it's done oops now I've got the whole um delivery menu as a Json in like literally half a second so the name description price everything you know taken and it's up to date and then I literally have I just I just throw this into my site in Jon format and it just formats it all into a styled um page immediately so just things like that as well which you can now do which again would never have been possible like where could you get update pricing and again we can now serve a whole new keyword Niche that you can never serve before you know we can literally take advantage of the fact that there's so much search volume for restaurant name and menu and it's highly undeserved like the best pce you can the number one link right now will literally have um you know an an old image of the menu and so people are naturally going to come here so you're obviously creating a great experience for people which also Google will favor so that's my that's my basically my show and tellal SEO rent um but now I'll actually show you how how you can start thinking about this first of all um we're going to start um with apify now what I'm going to show you guys to get into the building part of this is how how you can speak to how you can use different resources online different information sets data sets um and then how you can work with in this case going to work with Claude you can use chat GPT but I prefer Claude for its output I just think it's much more human uh I've at least felt that way when I've been using it um so the content is better and how you can use Claude to get it to repurpose that content or output content in a way that will be purposeful for your specific use case right so in this case will do a kind of a duplicate of like best to buy in a sense like a directory I'll just show you kind of the mechanics the simple kind of elements of it um and then you guys can go ahead and build this out for any type of Industry you want you know you can literally think of a directory for anything you know whether it's I don't know like you know gardening tips you know whatever you can literally just build this using the same system um so the main things we're using are web flow so this is web flow um for those you guys who haven't used it it's just like um you know uh what's the other one framer a bit like framer and figma but it's not just design you're actually building in it visually so it's really cool and you have a lot of cool ways of using U web flow right now designing in it I designed from scratch but you do have sites like flow base and raum uh which have loads of components on there that you can just kind of copy I think um Danny postma who's been on your pod before as well has a has a site called flow flow ponents um and again loads of webflow components you can just copy and just paste and with webflow you can literally find an element like you can hit free if you don't want to pay for one and it's it's as simple as saying I don't know let's say I wanted this hero section I can just go here hit webflow and it's copied it now and I go into my uh sit project I can just hit paste command V and I've got the design exactly in there so now I can do whatever I want with this you know um Craig's energy for a Greener tomorrow you know and so you're good to go straight away uh which makes it very easy to use so you don't have to to worry about design all that type of stuff there's so many resources out that you can use so that's web flow we'll come back to that in a moment the only other thing you need to know with web flow is that webflow has its own content management system um which if you just click this icon here it's called a CMS you can create your own collection so in my like best du buai site for example I've got quite a few because it's pretty expensive now but I'll have restaurants malls hotels and I'll have restaurant categories um Michelin guides all these type of things that I've got but just on a basic one you know just having restaurants for example gives you gives gives you an idea you're basically creating a catalog of listings within a specific um category um and so that's what collections are so we're going to set up collections in a moment but then the most important thing to start with really is first of all designing on your Niche so we can start with a travel directory we can just you know what's your favorite city in the world Greg uh let's do Montreal Montreal nice Canada cool okay so let's say we're creating a directory of Montreal Canada okay um the first thing we going to do is actually figure out the content that we want to use so you could just go to Claude and ask it you know um what are the best places to visit in Montreal now Claude like I said before is just going to give you the content that is has already indexed from the worldwide web that might be cool it might give us some obvious things um but I think you and sha had touched on this before Greg as well which is you actually want a directory with Nuance right you want a directory that can show you all the you know nooks and granes of a place and I think that's the most interesting thing about you know doing it without going into claw directly is using that knowledge you have and so you want to figure out well how can you take some of this Real World Knowledge real world information and then repurpose it into a format that can you you can leverage AI with um and even with me with best Dubai by the way like I've been going on Instagram pages of like bloggers and looking at the places that they're searching for and then indexing them on my site you know so I don't even have to go out there and find all these places and discover them myself if I go to Google I'm finding generic places if I go you know try and do my own mental thinking it's impossible to like you know get every single place that's here so if I go online and find the people that are hot right now are talking about things they're all creating Tik toks about all the best places and I can just go on there and learn about them and then add them to my site and now I'm effectively indexing all this information that is already out there um so you could do the same as well for for Montreal so what you would then do is that what then I start thinking about is how do I get this information you know I don't want to use Claude uh because it won't give me the best information and I came across appify um which some of you guys might have already seen um I think is becoming increasingly popular but effectively appify is like just loads of scrapers have you seen aify before Greg I have yes cool so loads of scrapers on there super cool Instagram Tik Tok LinkedIn there's so much data you can get off it uh but the one that I particularly find interesting is the is the Google Maps one right um and so if I go into you can just go in here um oh this little reviews one you can go into here and start using these for free so you can just start using uh one of the appify they call them actors so this the Google Business Google Maps business scraper um and after a certain amount of time you can pay for places like it's that $4 for a th000 places which is very cheap um and all you do is you enter the place ID of a place and it will give you all the information from Google about a given place right and so how do you do this well you go onto uh Google developer platform and you'll find the maps JavaScript API which has the place ID finder you can actually just search Place ID finder on Google and it'll bring you to this page um and we need the actual ID of a specific place right because that's how our actor runs it tells us to enter the ID of a place so Greg is now going to tell us his favorite place in Montreal to e at or visit let's do a restaurant maybe do I want to give it away that's the question all right let's do fifth best let's say lepress so it's l apostrophe Express cool um Denise Street the second one yeah fire all right um cool so this now is the place ID for Express and so every single listing on Google has its own unique set of characters that is its own place ID right and so you'll copy that and then we'll come into um here and we can just hit paste um and you can leave everything else the same there are some options you can mess around with but we're not going to right now and you can just hit uh save and start and what will happen is appify will start to actually get data about that specific place and for me it was surprising how much information you could get um so it runs doesn't take long at all like a few seconds and you just have this Rich set of data about Express now see we've got let's go to all Fields we've the address you know City uh images you know literally everything that you could think of is is just in this data set that we've just got straight away um and then so what I started doing is thinking about how we can make the most of this data so if I can get this data now if you kind of thinking about um if you're looking at our thinking process here we're just going kind of Step by Step we're saying well if we have this now if we have a set of data then what can we do with that set of data and actually us just Ting by ourselves um is interesting like you can be creative but what I found even more interesting is taking this information so hitting Json over here hitting preview new tab and then I'll just do this so it just literally helps me copy into one block I'll just command a copy the whole lot go to Claude start a new chat and hit paste and then just talk to Claude about the data so I'll give you a small example just say um um what can you tell me about this data so because that's in Json format now Claude can start to understand the information and it tells us you know this a French restaurant in Montreal this location this operation hours um and even and this is where I started to learn about information like bus period so on my site you can see I have like when it's buzzing when it's relaxed that's because Claude informed me that it actually has that information it actually knows how much occupancy it has on Saturday nights at 11: p.m. and that's the equivalent of when you go on Google um and search a place let's gopress Mont you'll notice on Google you have the popular times so apify is actually picking up this data as well and giving it to us and so in the Json you will see that here we have like the percentage occupancy per hour for 24 hours seven days a week um and so that's data you can also use so I found that particularly interesting and again that enhances the experience of what we can do so you can go into more depths with this so I I would then go to clae I'll give you another example so you guys can take any set of data you want but what I then did is I went to cord and said um okay I'm building um the most advanced uh directory of Montreal better than Trip Advisor um and Google um create a table create a table of all of the information you think I should include um be creative and detailed um in your uh response in fact I'm going to say create a HTML um site or yeah something like that so you can just liter get to actually create the landing page for you um if you really wanted to um and it just build it now um but actually the reason this is more interesting is because you're taking that set of data and when it builds out visually you can actually get a sense of like you know the information it can kind of give you and what Claude might think is interesting to include so I find this interesting just to like play around with and actually you know just read information visually see what it's thinking and it actually helps me ideate for instance recently I did this with a new set of data from best du buy and it told me best times to visit for date nights or best time to visit for U you know family lunches and I thought that's a cool little thing to add because you could have a whole section of your site that could again power your o which could be you know best restaurants to visit in Montreal on date night you know and I got that information from from Claude just um building out site for me so this is like a landing page that Claude is suggesting it wasn't it wasn't scrolling for some reason oh I think the site I think the page is so big it's got almost yeah that's so funny oh my goodness this thing look at that oh my gosh okay this is like more expansive than even I expected all right I don't this is this is such a cliff anger because you really want to see this but you don't even know if you can it might take us a whole episode to get to the bottom of it all right well maybe God okay we won't go through all of it but you get the you get the sense of what we're saying um it's highly detailed I don't know how they've laid this out but yeah you could you could play around with this but it's very very cool and you can get a lot of information just by doing doing this exercise so once you've done that you can actually figure out and create a kind of a um a criteria or list of what information you want to display on your site and the reason that's important is because our next step is going to be actually setting up this information in zapia so that we can then talk between all these different systems right zapia allows us to give it some sort of input data um and um then do something with that data so in this case we might want to say uh give it the place ID um and then from the place ID we want to connect it to appify we then want to connect apify to Claude and we then want to connect Claude to webflow right so now youve got the cycle of like literally just hitting a place ID in there and then just taking your foot off and letting the whole thing run and that's literally the way I've got best to buy setup now I can just p in a place ID so I'll literally be out some I'll go to a restaurant and I'll see something I like I'll just take the place ID I'll paste it and I'm I'm off and the entire page is generated for me because we've set it all up in webflow and zapia to to work automa atically so let's do that now so let's set up like an example for you guys so you can actually see how it works so you can actually set up zap here with any trigger meaning where is the data coming from right the data can come from slack you can set up with a slack channel so you send the place ID in a slack Channel and it comes from there um you know you can set up with air table whatever you want but for this case we're just going to use Google Sheets right and so I've got a clean Google sheet um here and the reason I also think Google Sheets is a cool thing to use is because once you've set this up you can Mass upload data and so why why I find AI super interesting right now in this this process is you can literally put in one phrase uh or one word in this case going to be the place ID and even this the the size of the page that I've developed right now and the design this is all done from me just adding a place ID and everything else is done automatically I'm not touching anything down to it being sent to Google um and so it really gives you kind of an idea of like how expansive your site can be how much information you can add just from one single entry on a Google sheet right and so we're going to add a column here with Place ID we're then going to go here and just take this as test data and paste this into our column um and then we've already connected our Google sheet to zapia we then going to tell it is this worksheet and then it should pick up um that specific row that there we go so it's picked out that place ID that's our test data and we continue with that and now we're going to add appify so zapia the reason I loved actually I was really surprised to see this as well that zapia had appify buil in there which makes your life so easy um and big deal man a huge deal right yeah like I know your mind's already going crazy right because even when I this I was like this is bunkers how many things you can create yeah I honestly didn't know that oh you didn't okay crazy um watch this so you can go um into here run uh synchronously um hit that yes and then okay so now it's going to ask us for basically our you know prompt or you know our our oh sorry this is the wrong one it's not a Google Maps stractor it's Google um business scraper there we go okay there we go all right so you can delete the information that's in by default it's going to basically ask you for the place ID here right and so the great thing with zapia is everything's a variable meaning um if you CH if you add like a new row with a new place ID and you configure it in zapia it will just pick up that new place ID right and so you don't have to manually put the place ID here we're actually going to click plus over here and then go to place ID so tell tell tell zapia to pick up the place ID from our Google spreadsheet and so it will do that but we need to add a bit at this uh kind of the start of the URL for for um this actor to run and so I've got this over here I'm just going to copy this URL um and just paste it so it's a simple URL you guys can just screenshot from here and and copy that this a start of the URL this is going to be the place ID which will go at the end um and that's it we h test step and now what will happen is that actor is running the same way it ran when we did it manually right so instead of going through appify now going through zapia um and it'll go and get this information for us now throughout this process the reason I think the the reason I think like best of buy guilty Chef um are kind of working the way they are is because to get to the results to the point that we've got them I've had to solve problems along the way which there weren't really any obvious solutions for right and so some of them are like repurposing repurposing content uh in a way that can be read by clae um you know like I said like creating Chrome extensions where we can get uh you know information from delivery when enter into our site these kind of creative hurdles that you got to jump through so some of this information I'll share with you now is like some of that work I've already done which you guys can just immediately do and start and have your system working um so we've got now the information of Le Express we can see the address here the the uh URL um by the way Greg you like this on the URL on our site anytime you visit the site s we also automatically add um our reference at the end which is again so yeah so in their analytics they're seeing that the traffic is coming from us um that is huge I want to just speak to that for one second when I was when I was at uh I sold a company to stumble upon which was many years ago very large social network that would refer traffic to Publishers websites and people used to see in their analytics that stumble upon would send them traffic so then all of a sudden we'd have like BuzzFeed hit us up and be like hey you guys drove us like a million visits crazy in the last 30 days um can we pay you for more traffic wow so you'll why I think that is so smart having the reference and the link is people will start seeing it in in their in their analytics and they will proactively reach out to you and it's way better for them to reach out to you than for you to reach to them like the power dynamics are completely different for sure for sure no no I that's a great story Man by congrats on that that's a big deal as well so you s you sold it to stumble upon yeah when I was like yeah that's a whole other story but crazy crazy amazing man well yeah so that's that's that's great that that gives me a lot more confidence in this as well amazing um cool and so now we've got our data in appify actually what you'll see here is the data that we're getting out is all in IND individual kind of strings right like you got the data set sorry let me go to much more better information like you got the neighborhood here you got the category here you got the name here that might sound great it's like yeah we got all this information but the problem we have here is when we actually spoke to Claude we gave Claude a single Json like just output and this isn't that you know this is basically just broken down format the reason this is a problem is because if I now go here to uh add CL if I add Claude here and let's say we give it that prompt um let's say we then say you know tell me about this data what I really want to do is have one single out uh input that I can add the problem with appies output is it gives you everything broken down separately and so you can't just sit there adding everything you know that's absolute you know pain and no one's doing that so that was the first hdle I came across um and so what we have to do what we do is is if you look at um well what we do know is that it actually provides us a Json output so we know it's in there and so when you actually look at the data that you get from appify right at the bottom you'll see there's a data set in different file formats and one of them is Json so it actually has it here you just have to extract it right and then give that to Claude And so what we're going to do is we're going to add another step here and I'm going to hit code um by zapia this is where zapia allows you to just kind of run some code like python JavaScript we're going to hit run python hit continue in input data we're going to put URL and then we're going to add the input data as um the Json file so the data items Json file URL and then we have the script here so this script we're going to take I'm going to copy this by the way Shameless plug but I've got a school.com 5D Sprint in my school Community you can find like you know the breakdown of all these this all the code and all this stuff I'm pasting in here as well you can just grab it from there um if you don't want to copy it from here so in here you can just add the this little code snippet and it will basically take this URL uh sorry take the this key and understand that the value is this Json U file over here and then take that and give us the output as one single Json string um okay so you let that run and we will have our output as one single Json so just basically taken that file and printed it for us okay and so now we have a single string that we can now give to Claude so we can go to Claude and say you know we can just literally reference this output now which is all of that data it's the equivalent of this okay and so now the next step is is actually getting the data R and so this is the prompt that we're actually going to give to Claude to then populate our directory so there's two things that are important here the first is the actual information that we're going to ask it to give us the second is the format in which we ask it uh uh to give us that information and the reason the format is important is because if you think about um all the information that we have on a web page like here we've got the name the address we've got um the URL phone number so much information going on Claude doesn't give us a web page designed like this right it doesn't break everything down like this I've designed this specifically in web flow to work for me and if you go here um sorry you guys can be creative in you know in your own way when whenever you do it but if I go to like restaurants template in my site every single element here is a separate design element and it's connected the data is connected to a part of my CMS so this is dynamically connected to the quisine name you know or like this about bit here is D dyn dynamically connected to the short description data and that's coming from my CMS which I showed you guys is over here and so what our job right now is we want to send information to webflow so it can go into our CMS in the right columns and in the right format in order to do that we have to get that information from Claude okay so the first step is to understand what information you want so literally you know very specifically the name the URL with the you know the reference appended on it every single detail of what you're looking for you want to make sure you know in advance and so i' I'd suggest just having that list with you um and now I'll talk to you guys a little bit about formatting so I'll I'll do a couple of quick examples of like you know basic information and then you guys can go and break it down however you want later on so we're simply going to say um using using this uh data um I want you to Output um some you know information for me I actually have like a better prompt in my whole thing but I don't have the it's in a different zapia file right now so we just go off the coffee um so first of all you can give you can give uh Claude some like key guidelines to follow so some basic ones that are normally do like for me for example for this site I wanted it in like UK English so I said to it um print your output in UK English I just give you guys an example of about things you could tell it um you know um and wait sorry and if if I wanted it to be printed in uh Canadian French would it yeah like other languages work as well yeah we can try it do you want to try Canadian French yeah Canadian French I might not be able to read it but you can help me um cool but any any type of information you want to give it here like guidelines wise you can give it you know there's so many different things that you can add here again a breakdown of the exact prompt that I use for breast the buyers in my school community so you can see exactly how I talk to talk to uh Claude but as an example you put your guidelines there now by the way yeah the reason I the reason I car you know the Canadian French is interesting to me is I think I think a lot of people are just creating directories that are English first but I actually think like geography specific yeah yeah you know like and then and then registering for example instead of registering it's very hard to get a.com but a doca or. co.uk orfr might be a lot easier to get completely yeah yeah that's a good point actually yeah that is true and I think that yeah especially with like you know the way you know specific need is for um specific languages as well yeah because can Canada is predominantly French as well isn't it not mainly French but French is one of the main languages so it's one of the main main languages yeah makes perfect sense exactly domain yeah even here now like we've been thinking about e domain Arabic you know it's completely true and you can just get the output directly from Claude yeah um so now you now you can start to ask Claude the information you want and so this is where the formatting comes into it and so I have a technique of um basically taking this larger prompt which is the main prompt we given Claude but including mini prompts within it and with these mini prompts is where you can actually be very creative right and you can think outside the box here and so the way you want to structure this is anything that you want to ask Claude for you're going to put the titles inside um asterisks right with a colon and so let's say um place name I'm going to do asterisk as asterisk place name asterisk asterisk and colon right and so so now anything I say after that is going to be the instruction to Claude of how to get me that specific data right and so I will say um print uh the title of the restaurant now you can simply say that or you could be a bit more creative here you could literally ask it to print the title of the restaurant but add I don't know whatever you know hello Canada at the end of it or you know so it l print you whatever that mini prompt is right so that's an example another one might be let's say a website URL so you could say um print the base URL so not just URL I'm saying base URL which might just be like if you had mario.com hotels whatever you might just want the mario.com bit right and so you can ask it for the base URL um print the base URL of this place um and um append the URL with um ref equals uh gregr um and so on you know you could do this for like you know whatever information you want you could take the Give an example is the image URL that Google gives appi gives from Google is actually low res and so that was causing me to have low res images on my site and so in my prompt I said to it take the image URL and to change the width and height properties of the URL in its output and it did that so I could literally change URLs and everything so Claude basically what Claude is doing every time you're asking something is going back and reading all the this data and then giving you what you specifically want here so effectively you're just organizing the information for your specific use case right um and so you can go down the whole thing here let's just do a quick one like busiest so let's say um best uh date time best for date time best time for date night so you tell it to print in specific format you can say print the best time to visit this place um for date night um print your output as actually Greg you know what I'm going to do I'm GNA actually just change this to English for a minute because um we can actually then see what it actually says um sounds good yeah print the rest time to visit play print your output as um in the in the following format format example and I'll say like um Tuesdays from 12: to 8: p.m. um without the um what's it called Speech marks but so that's an example so this is giving you a little bit of an idea of how you could speak to Claude right so now we can hit continue um and so by the way obviously you know for side this there's lots going on like we actually asking it for so much information so you can break down whatever information you want let's just add one actually for score actually I'm going to do a scoring one with you guys over here quickly this how I did it just give you some context so you can say um write me an algorithm so write me a prompt that I can give Claude to um rank this uh place um on a um scale out of 10 um you should also um create individual categories for things like uh um food experience service Etc whatever you think is best and each of those should have a score the final score should be calculated based on these individual scores or whatever you know can you cck can you click uh High it says River Side FM is sharing your screen no worries um write the um provide the in a code also when I'm speaking to Claude I'm just like I'm not thinking much about like what I'm asking yeah I kind of refine as I go because sometimes I read it back and I'm just like speaking like an idiot and then you refine it so so there you go so that's is it will literally this is what I'm talking about like you want to just help it just give you the information that you're looking for so this is exactly what us it will go and do it will give me the prompt of like please analyze the data using these categories food and menu service and stuff overall experience for each category score out 10 this key factor influence the score so I'm going to say um reduce reduce it down to five categories and we don't need the key factors uh list it out Simply the scores and then what you can do by the way Omar once you have these scores and you can do this I mean you'll be able to do this with your website is you can create an embeddable widget that restaurants could embed on their products and be like I got 97% score and why why is that so genius is it actually gener exactly it's a backlink play just a backlink play right so in SEO the more backlinks you get the more high quality back links you get the more High more Trust basically you get um and you'll just get more traffic so yeah dope idea amazing man I mean do you know one of the things was thinking is like I can't bring myself to do it because I I haven't got the buy I haven't bought into it creatively yet but it's the Google uh podcast thing llm you know the the podcasts that you notbook notbook LM notbook LM yeah so like I actually put the URL in there and it just it like took M of Emirates which has like a ski slope in it and it was like Yeah hold my camel you know there it was like so cool but and amazing but I was like ah like we could we could technically just end up having a whole podcast for like all these places which also helps SEO massively too but you know haven't I haven't like mentally committed to it just yet what do you think about like doing stuff like that as well like you know generating content using notebook llm for the for for for SEO purposes do you think it has a benefit I think it has a benefit yeah yeah I mean yes absolutely all right that might be interesting worth exploring then um so we're going to say score um so we're going to then say um please analyze so then we're going to say here um score scoring algorithm rithm and then just give it the prompt please analyze the data and then provide boom and then again we're going to say um um you know whatever food and menu score uh say uh generate score so food and menu score um and we say print the food and menu score out of 10 to two decimal places so again you go through the whole thing and then finally we can do like you know total uh total score print the uh the final weighted score out of 10 yeah so just things like this you can do and oh oops mistake yeah colon all right so we'll hit continue now uh and then test that and so Claude will now go and do the entire process and read your prompt uh and get us information in the format that we're asking you for um and so there we go now we have place name Le Express website URL with our reference at the end of it best time for dat night Wednesdays from 9:00 p.m. to 7 to 9 p.m. low occupancy then weekends but still good atmosphere so what's interesting here is like it's given us like information and brackets that we don't want um I just wanted this information so I would go back in my prompt and and refine that and just be clear about that so you can do that uh scoring analysis basally available data is giving us all the scores um so did food and menu score um again it's given us actually too much information we only wanted to score so we could like tell it to refine that um and toal weighted score as well it's given us so that's basically a structure now if we had more time I'd go back and I refine The Prompt but just to show you guys that's how you can basically talk to Claude and get the information you want so the main thing here is to make sure that the format is for every piece of information you want is asterisk asterisk um the thing you want asterisk asterisk colon and then the mini prompt the instruction and that can be as elaborate as you want you can literally get to write you a like code if you want and so now what we have is another challenge which is the clae actually give us the output in a single text block right same way as as it would give us output here um like this and so if I just wanted to take like the opening hours I can't do that right because it's one big text block if I try to send information to webflow web flow will take this entire text block same way will take all of this information as one it wouldn't know how to break it down and so the reason we added the asterisks is because that is a a rule we've set a bit like an indicator for the next step which is another piece of python code we're going to add and so we're going to hit run python here and we this the input data this time is going to be response and here we're going to put the uh cla's actual output right and now what we can do is take this bit of code and paste here and basically what this is telling CL um uh zapia to do is find the pattern where is asterisk asterisk and then basically strip that down and give us just the information after that right and so you hit this and immediately it will just break that text down and so now we've got the place name as an individual string URL as an individual string and all the information that we asked for again the score here would want it just to be 9.20 but that's based on you know the prompt that we gave it we can refine that but effectively anywhere those asterisk is broken down and given us a string of information and so now you can see that if you kind of extrapolate this out that's how you start to get every little detail that I have here like you know FAQs the phone number the you know the opening hours every single thing is individual sets of data that I've asked it for um and then the final step you would do now that you have this information is is connect to your webflow project right and so I here webflow and so if we go to our webflow project here we might want to create a um collection item quickly so we'll say our collection will be um you know restaurants and we have name in there already we can have different fields so in web flow you can have you know all different types of fields here so another text might be you know total score um and then another field item might be uh no we could have the URL here so we could say um you know URL um so let's just create that collection so again you guys can you know really build this out and maybe we can do a more detailed breakdown uh in future as well um and so normally webflow you'd add things manually here right you click add and then you'd manually add uh sorry you'd manually add a new place um but that's obviously very timec consuming we're not going to be doing that the good thing with zapia is if I just publish this um with zapia is it connects to webflow and so it can find your CMS items and you can just map fields to that CMS and so you have a now that we created a CMS you have a template page here restaurant template so same way over here I have uh restaurant templates this is my restaurant template page um you also have that right and so now you can put any type of design element you want in here so we could go into here and copy something you know let's take um what let's take this over here copy this for argument sake you know this might be our uh title uh this might be um the total score total score um you know this might we might want this to link to URL right so like visit and I could even go as far as saying visit and another text block where it would say that the place is name the the name of the place again and so um we will go to uh back to zapia now go to the web flow step and we're going to create a live item with now we're going to go account and we're going to connect to my account hit continue you're going to pick your site this our sip AI our collection it's found the restaurant collection we've just created uh By the way when you create a collection make sure you publish that's otherwise zapia won't pick it up so if you struggle with that it's probably because you haven't published it and now all the fields we've just added so we've only added a few of them but again if you have a big site you can have as many fields as you want here um you can start to see the fields here now we can actually map data to these fields that we've just set up and so the place name now if you see here we've G we got the um python response uh from our clae output broken down and this is the place name over here we then have the total score which is going to be the data that we're connecting from our python output again which is going to be like you know uh where's total score uh total score maybe it should be a total score H didn't give us total score okay location accessibility let's just put that score in for now just so we can see where it looks like um and then URL we'll have our URL from here your website URL um cool and then slug so in my in my in my site I actually create the slug as well with Claude so the reason I do that so if you see over here this this slug which would be SL Parkers normally you just we clicked on it but it be part the reason I do that is because when you're doing your SEO you want the slug to be you want to know what the slug is so that you can when you generate your schema you actually reference the correct URL for Google um because you it's difficult to create the schema once your web flow item has been created you know um and so now that we're done that we can hit continue and then test step oh it doing that is there a bad request error URL oh might be this over here let me see what's going on well I love that there's a bug cuz yeah I know this is real life man so funny like I never really haveg bug Let's test again let's see what's going on okay now okay so here's what I'll do I would just basically individually delete and test again and see where it's coming from all right cool okay fine so there's some formatting issue somewhere so maybe this let's see um and this is just good for people while you're debagging this this is just good for people to see how someone like you once they have a problem how do they think about debugging yeah for sure for sure for sure yeah now it's uh I normally just kind of work back through my steps so I'll just like normally I'll go like so if you saw here I went to webflow I saw that it was obviously I just deleted two things I'm trying to just minimize get back to like you know one step at a time so let's add place and see if that works if that doesn't work then this was all nothing here was working so at least we know that works it sends to webflow and so before I start adding total score I'm actually curious because I can't find total score so I just went back to my step here and wanted to see if we actually got total score as an output and we did and so we do have the total score there um and in our code did they break it down well we don't see total score here we only see value so something's going on uh um where there must be a asterisk problem because if you see here like food menu score this all looks wrong so somewhere ibly missed missed something in the formatting so let's have a look at our prompt again so have we missed a colon somewhere no we got the colons in place interesting so we got our place name yep yep so could ah hold on a second it could be maybe because we've got the percentages and dollars in there these signs so what we want to do is yeah so I think that's messing up formatting so uh SC as B available data yeah I don't know why it's adding Astro c not asking it to so okay so now we can go to our guidelines and say print your output uh print only the output print only print your output as the uh trying to think of the English that I chuse print only um the uh titles inside asterisks um followed by the um followed by the answer to that specific prompt this is probably not making right right sense in English let's see only only the titles inser Asis followed by the answer prompt if my instruction uh if no no let's not worry about that let's just see what it's done for now [Music] uh two places EG 9.10 EG 8.20 um Now speech marks and no additional TCH cool let's see if it does that Okay cool so yeah it seems to be better food menu score total score yeah okay so that looks about right let's retest the step okay good this bit over here though why does it put that in day night ah because we have this information down here after it so it's thinking it's all part of it um why is it doing that it's very strange though because I've never had this thing before where like it will literally follow one from the next thing um there must be something in my prompts normally I don't have the prompts in front of me that normally add in the guidelines that tells you not to do that um yeah let me see scores chose analyze we'll give it a couple minutes if not what we'll just do is we'll edit this part out and we'll just be like and then you publish it to we web flow yeah yeah yeah yeah I'm just wondering the why why it's even why is it taking night you know I'm going to do let me just jump into my actual normal yeah it's not this one um submit play working here just read the so my normal prompts are like enormous now this is a prompt so I'll give you the title of I to up for the wrapped in as for example restaurant rules I've set for you when you give me the I simplify the side yeah cool all right let's take this and see if it works when you give the output okay avoid using generic or AI sounding language I like that I know if there is French actually no let's not do that everything be French yeah because it is literally Montreal so if there's uh okay we just do it here cool all right so you can probably just take out the bit where I just went over to this project yeah we can just go straight into this okay so I've just put the guidelines in from our other project from best of buyo project let's see if this works so it should be a little bit clear I'll give you a title of a field I want you to Output data for this field will be R in asterisks cool so let's see if this works otherwise Lord knows why it's it down using that anyway let's see fingers crossed ah actually I do know why okay let's see what happens I do know why yeah I do know why the reason that's happening is because okay this is better now but what's happening is it's actually yeah it was adding information into the clae response response only should be the asterisks no other information so it was including this as part of the response so that was a problem so we just had to kind of clarify probably like to where to stop so now what's happening is it's given us a score but then the category breakdown so total score uh yeah so we'll just go here print uh print the food menu score out of 10 places only print the score all right let's see if this helps gets us through the door all right yeah cool there we go all right so a little bit of PL around CLA but we got there so what your output should look like this it should just simply be every you know each item you've asked for with the information and there shouldn't be anything else in between it should just be the output you want right because this is the data we're going to send now to webflow cool so now we can go here we can continue with the python step again break the data down now the data is broken down for us we H continue um and we can add the information here hey where did total score going total score disappeared on us now all right let me one second it's going to bug me it's two seconds Craig why did it do that total score is here yeah very odd right it is totally that is so odd why I didn't playing with my emotions yeah okay would get there if we had more time all right no problem all right fine let's just use um the food menu score on a total score fine um and URL here um as the URL yep co uh oops no it's incorrect because it's not in a https format oh yes so good eye yeah that's going to be a formatting issue so we got URL um URL in full HTP format the URL of this place in format cool so fun to build stuff in this day and age you know what it is it is it's like you can just sit here it's so annoying look at this stupid thing it's like written this whole thing out doing that it's so I've never had this happen with cl it's rid what model are we using are we using like oh maybe it's three and a half concise because there's a lot of traffic you think so is that possible maybe you see balance most powerful latest Sonic balance very St very very odd that it would it would do that like I've never seen it be only I'm saying only print the score and nothing else after like how clear do we have to be it's wild but anyway you see yeah okay well it's there for now this might be because it's got and in it let me let's let's let's change this yeah so maybe that's why it's not breaking it down because any odd food and menu score so it might be anything with an extra symbol because we on best to buyo basically we had an issue where like we get the pricing in dollars the symbols to reflect like not as expensive or whatever and it was crashing the site and it actually took us like 3 days to figure out it was because there was like a character it they couldn't understand um yeah this how how does that even make wait do not do not do not give me any explanation in your output I'm getting increasingly angry in my front just the answer I'm looking for based on the instructions please and thank you you know how many times I've been like it's like bedtime my kids and they're like dying to go sleep and I'm like just give me one minute I'm just TR to sus this thing out all right come on fingers crossed let's get there let's just break everything down let's all right I'm Giving Up on total score I don't know what on Earth is going on there all right we've got this information that we have great Fooda menu score is there uh the URL is there let's drop that in cool y all right nice so all right boom so at least we have that now so in in web flow now you'll have your data that's just been added um and so we see the score is in there the way we broken it down URL and the name so now you can start to understand that you can literally add whichever field you want whatever type of prompt you want into CLA be as creative as you want with the prompt so long as you ask it to wrap the output in those asterisks and then break it down and then you can just print that information back into Claude so the last thing you're going to do here to tie it all up is you're going to find the data element you want to you know connect it to so here we're going to take the title we're going to go to settings and hit this purple little plus here and we're going to say it's going to come from name and so it's going to pick you up from our CMS total score obviously this is like just a dead design you can design it however you want total score be there and then like visit um and again you put that name so visit l express and then the URL as well can also be connected from your CMS so if you click the link button here and it say get URL from restaurant so you can hit this and it'll find the url field that you can hit and so that's Bas that's a most most Bare Bones basic way of setting up something between you know these platforms um and once you've done that you will have a basic web page but at least has got data on it your own data and then this URL will link to their site with your reference on it um yes that's that I would have well I don't mind showing you the SEO stuff if you want to we can do that another time depending how you have well I mean I think dude the amount of value you just gave is insane like we had an idea for for for a directory we built it it all works of course it's not stylized and stuff like that but that's like the easy part honestly yeah um so um stylizing it and then um yeah we'll have to have you back on here another time for for for SEO and startup ideas but dude Omar thank you so much for your time Omar where could uh where could people get to know you a little bit better and is there anything you want to say to

1) The Store Credit Hack
Instead of basic "20% off" - tell customers they have $21.63 in store credit expiring soon

Why it works:
• Feels like "their money"
• Specific numbers boost authenticity
• Creates urgency

2) The Premium Play
How luxury brands do Black Friday:
• No discounts
• Give gift cards with purchase
• Example: Apple gives $200 credit
Keeps brand prestige while driving sales 

3) The Bundle Builder
Four Sigmatic's genius approach:
• Interactive bundle builder
• Unlocks bigger discounts at $59/$99
• Shows real-time savings
• Makes shopping fun
Steal this for your store 

4) The Bonus Stack
MagicMind's approach:
• Start with core discount
• Add digital product access
• Include physical gifts
• Stack more bonuses as week progresses

Psychology: Value over Discount

5) The Subscription Push
SaaS playbook:
• Offer renewal discounts
• Add exclusive bonuses
• Example: Endel does 50% off + premium gifts
• Works for any subscription business

6) The QVC Strategy
Modern twist:
• Run 12-hour livestream sales
• Show limited quantities
• Create FOMO
• Add exclusive bundles
• Perfect for influencer brands

7) The Campaign Timeline
Smart businesses:
• Plan 6 months ahead
• Start ads 3 days before
• Build waiting lists
• Layer in bonuses
• Peak on Friday

8) The Profit Reality
The Truth:
• Could make 1-2 months revenue in 1 week
• Some brands make yearly revenue
• Even "bad" years saved by Black Friday
• Ignoring it = leaving millions on table

Remember: Black Friday isn't just a discount day.
It's a strategic revenue event that can make your entire year.
Don't flub it

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
Jay ice cream what what is this episode about so it is as of as of recording this it is Black Friday week it is one of the biggest uh weeks of the year in terms of sales for e-commerce companies for product companies for info product companies uh we are running multiple Black Friday sales for companies this week and I thought what I've been surprised about is that a lot of companies who sell things uh not just services but like a lot of people who sell like sell products don't take part in Black Friday and if they do they don't really understand the different types of deals and different types of sales they can do and so I thought it would be cool to look at some really cool examples of sales that are running right now as this week goes on and look at the different ways you can run Black Friday sales but also any type of sale [Music] it's sipping time baby and there's it's not just oh I'm going to do a discount that's like really lowlevel running a sale campaign thing um just to give you a feeling like a company that's making let's say uh 500k a month or 200k a month could make1 to2 million do in just this week and a company that's making like 10 million per month or 20 million per month could make like all of their yearly Revenue combined in just this one week as well and so it's not and and a lot of people don't understand that you know sometimes I talk to entrepreneurs and they're like oh I don't want to take part in that I don't want to take part in like it's too you know we're prestigious brand and like we want to stay away from that kind of stuff and I'm like let me show you all the prestigious brands that are more prestigious than you running sales like this and you just don't understand how to actually do it in a way that's maybe you know on brand so I think a lot of people are not thinking about Black Friday as a sales opportunity and people who do think of it as a sales opportunity often completely flub it because they don't know the different types of sales that they can do we run a Black Friday sale every year we run Black Friday sales for our customers and they make millions of dollars and I think we can show you I I'd like to show you like some of my favorite examples that are out there right now and teach people a few things they can learn for their own things that they're selling that's my idea for today anyway so a few things number one I like the way you say prestigious prestigious you say PR prestig what do I say prestigious you say prestigious do I say prestigious or do I say prestigious no no you say prestigious let the record show that you say prestigious that's number one number two you said the word flub flub which which I thought was an incredible word flubby write write flub in the comments if if you agree with me and uh number three I think you know the saying if you make it in New York you can make it anywhere yes well I think if you can do a great Black Friday sale you could sell anything on the internet so I'm excited to dive in with you I I have an alternative way of saying that if you can do a great Black Friday sale you can literally up everything for the rest of the year and still have a great year there we go you could have your your worst year ever full of the worst strategic business decisions and still nail back Friday and still make it all back like I'll tell you we've had some you know at 2023 we didn't have a great year like we I made some strategic decisions at AJ and smart that I don't think were very clever um and Black Friday was Black Friday and kind of like summer sale those made up for some of the sillier decisions or or larger expenses um so yeah that would be my really messy alternative uh quote for that so should we have a look at a couple of these Black Friday sales and kind of look at what they're doing like I haven't broken it down into different types yet but I I think there's like there's companies that do discounts there's companies that do free bonuses and no discount there's companies that do bundles with discounts and free bonuses and there's companies who do sort of like if you if you've got like a subscription software service there's really interesting things people do to get you to renew as well so I think there's a mixture of everything in here from physical products to SAS products to just like services and stuff like that so I think I've got a big L I've got a big overview of some nice things well I show you the first one because I can literally just open it on my phone right now so do you know the product endle uh is it a sleeping type thing yeah so they basically do um I'm sorry that this is not really focusing so endle basically does uh different types of noise and soundscapes which help with stress and sleeping and they have like ADHD Focus whatever and it's I personally think it's a really nice product um and my renewal is coming up but I chose an annual non-automatic renewal last year and so what's coming up on my screen year and I'll tell you what they did last year as well to get me in they are showing me this 50% off if I renew and when I tap into it and obviously I Got a notification about that and if I tap into it I'm essentially given a mini landing page within the endel app which is showing me all of the benefits that I might have forgotten about and this sale this like this is kind of something that evolves throughout the Black Friday week where they might add in a bonus towards the end of the week last week last year they added in a really nice nicely designed endle bag um whoever designed that endle bag I know you guys are based in Berlin that bag convinced me um but yeah so this this is something where if you have a software product or if you have a service where there's an annual renewal doing something around Black Friday even if that's not exactly the time where people are renewing so for example with the PlayStation or Sony this week are doing their Black Friday sale they started it last Friday and they have this PSN service which is you pay for that service to play multiplayer on PlayStation and even if you're already a subscriber to PSN which I am they'll say hey if you want to like extend for another year if you want to add more on you can do it at a discount during this week and so that's something which is like a you're already locked into the system you're already part of the subscription but now during Black Friday week when people are expecting things to be happening and discounts to be happening they're offering you a way to extend uh whoop is doing the same thing you'll probably see these boys here um along with doing a lot of like little bonuses with their bands and everything but yeah SAS products are doing like renewal pushes around this time of the year and if you're not a member they're obviously doing their subscription pushes at this time of the year so that's one example that I really like if you're running some sort of digital product some sort of SAS thing uh this is the time of year where you can push people on some sort of nice juicy renewal plan you should check out endle it's nice quick ad break let me tell you about a business I invested in it's called boring marketing.com so a few years ago I met this group of people that were some of the best SEO experts in the world they were behind getting some of the biggest compan compies found on Google and the secret sauce is they've got a set of technology and AI that could help you out rank your competition so for my own businesses I wanted that I didn't want to have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I didn't want to depend on ads to drive customers to my businesses I wanted to rank high in Google that's why I like SEO and that's why I use boring marketing.com and that's why I invested in it they're so confident in their approach that they offer a 30-day Sprint with 100% money back guarantee who does that nowadays so check it out highly recommend boring marketing.com is there anything you would do differently uh if you were running marketing at endle so we I think that uh they are doing a great job first of all I think they they really put it front and center um I think I would probably take the uh approach that mind uh Magic mind and AG one are taking this week which is I would include the free gifts upfront so free gift the free gift strategy I think I spoke about it the last time I was on but if we maybe open up do you mind if I just share my screen and open up magic mind just in case this is gone I don't mind at all I don't you know what you know what that that's the equivalent of is what when you get like I don't know maybe you get some oysters or you get a fish and someone says do you mind if I let it you know like put some lemon on it it's like obviously we don't mind if you put lemon on it like no one is going to go no one is gonna get mad at you for sharing your screen right now no one's gonna get mad at you for putting lemon on the oysters I just don't want you to get mad at me okay so I think what magic mind has done in my opinion is like a master class in a Black Friday sale uh we're emulating a lot of this for the Black Friday sales we're running um first of all you obviously get your discount upfront second of all you get welcome gifts and welcome gifts are things that you're only going to get as part of this sale and so the welcome gifts are you get 90 days access to this open app I don't know if you've ever used this open app it's really nice um you know it's usually $60 now it's free you get the Beyond coffee book which teaches you how to become more productive but without without coffee and you also get free shipping as part of a welcome gift um I think they have the same gifts for both so this is something where not only are they saying okay if you just come back to us and subscribe we'll give you 50% off uh Magic mind plus free gifts that's the thing that actually gets you it like sweetens the deal um ag1 are doing the exact same thing I don't know if you've seen how many gifts they're adding to their thing but it's been building up for the entire Black Friday month I'll show you let's see if they're presenting this publicly yeah they're calling it their welcome pack oh there oh there's some of some of this stuff's only happening in email so it depends how far how long you've been in their funnel I guess but they're currently doing this I'm just going to actually switch it to English because it's on German no we're gonna have to do we're gonna have to do German I'm sorry I'm very sorry do you mind if we do this in German that's where I draw the line so you can see that ag1 right now for Black Friday is doing um two travel packs vitamin D the container and the Shaker all for the price of what you usually just get the the bag and and the initial Shaker for um if you look at their Black Friday email campaign they've also added in a hat so sometimes what you can do and that's what we also do is you start with a set of free gifts and as the campaign goes on you add more free gifts which obviously you give to the people who joined early but it convinces people towards the end of the sale to jump in and there sometimes you can call these Miffy most incredible free gifts ever sometimes you can call these one like one-time welcome gifts but it's like a way to a lot of people do merch like a one-time merch which you can only get during this period of time um I just think it's a really people don't realize how powerful it is to just give someone something to sweeten the deal and discounts are often not enough there's another way do you want to see like the more Prestige way to do it what is it prestigious prestigious um so this is so what people will say to me is like yeah but like like you know premium Brands like apple doesn't do that and blah blah blah I'm like all right all right let's take a look at what Apple's doing yes they do something very different but they still really push Black Friday and Cyber Monday so let me show you how Apple make this happen um apple and this is something that's also effective and more you know high brow this is you buy a product from Apple during this period of time a non-discounted product and you get a $200 gift voucher that you can spend on something else from Apple so it's not that you're getting a discount it's not that you're getting a free gift it's that they're giving you a $200 voucher during this per period of time to buy something else from them and I think that's like a really great way to not cheapen these high quality products and like these kind of you know high-end products while still technically giving you a discount they're just not saying it upfront they're giving you a $200 disc gift card so they're theoretically giving you a discount because you have to spend it with them but they're not saying this is a discount can I show you another really can I show you a cool and really creative one that an e-commerce shop has done wait can I show you can I show you something I'm like yeah we are the biggest nerds on the internet I think dude we've the entire AJ and smart team for the last month we've just been collecting these and obsessing about them show me yours I'll show you mine if you show me yours all right well I'll go for it no yeah go on okay here we go so what I like about this is Black Friday sale you have $763 in store credit so instead of doing like buy something and you get a gift card I think that if people have credit that is look hello hello Max you've got store credit which is about to expire for good on Sunday they put your account email and they say use your code to apply the credit at checkout uh gainsinbulk dcom um and then you it's just like it feels like no I don't want to lose my credit that's my credit that's really cool I'm I'm just literally I just screenshot that I screenshotted it and add it to our uh Team Black Friday thing that's really cool I love that one so store credit so they're basically telling you you've got this store discount instead of a discount right everyone thinks of discounts I'll give you 10% off 20% off 30% off if if the average you know order size is $100 and and you were going to give $20 off right instead of saying you have 20% off because everyone is saying you have 20 20% off the whole internet is saying you have 20% off say you have actually don't say you have $20 in credit say you have $21.63 in credit I love that that's really cool that's really nice um I just need to I want to tell my team this for the next email so just give me one sec can you bring that up on screen again so because my screenshots didn't actually work who's this from um it's from Jordan on my team sent it to me so it's from gains in bulk like what is that I wonder what that's about oh no this is going oh no yeah that's that is so good okay that's it's like a protein company right yeah like creatine workout candy good name athletic digestive formula yeah okay I'll show you one um from my email screenshot Hole uh so this is another concept which is let me see can you see my base camp thing I see I see growth day yeah look at this yeah so this instead of doing a discount instead of doing uh myth Keys instead of doing anything else it's okay all those things that weren't in one package before are now in one box at like a slightly better price than buying all of them individually so and and creating a branded element a new branded product that's now going on sale during this period of time I think this is a really cool it's a really cool way of not just doing something discount or not just doing something uh like you know free gift it's like I'm just taking all of this stuff you see companies like asop doing this as well this the the hand soap comp or like the beauty company I don't know they've bundled um like different scents into a box and they're like special things for Christmas which make you want to buy them for friends um I really like that as a simple repackaging of all the things you already have as a bundle to sell for Black Friday I like that one I like that too I think you know you showed it with um who was it magic mind I thought what was really cool about their kind of bundle is they were giving a free digital product that I don't think I don't think they started that company probably I don't think so either yeah just I think that yeah so if you're looking for something to bundle go reach out to companies that you like and they're happy because they're getting distribution like a digital product is free to distribute um and you're happy because you're adding value and I think like it's such a missed opportunity when I see companies like companies with million dooll Facebook meta budgets and they're just doing straight up discounts or I mean the worst case scenario is they're just ignoring Black Friday because they don't like if you talk to someone and they're running an e-commerce site or they're selling things online and you ask them like September are you guys getting ready for November and they're like what do you mean November I'm like all right goodbye either you're making too much money or just shit's not working at all because you need to know like from like June we already knew the 29th of uh November was coming up we're already thinking about it and if you're spending like a million dollars already per month and you're just sending people to a straight up discount I think that's crazy especially when this could be your biggest week of the year can I show you a really cool one like a really creative one I cannot tell you whether this works or not because I don't know anything about it I just think this one's cool so zero data on this but Vibes Positive Vibes I need to reach out to the team and ask them why they decide to do this okay I've always been a fan by the way it's also good for your brand sip more save more sip more baby hell yeah so they're doing something kind of interesting so you can either shop their rated kits which are going to be bundles or you can build your bundle and i' I've been playing around with this so here's like a whole like little web app for Black Friday and the more you add to the bundle the more you save so there's this checkpoint at $99 after which point so there's a checkpoint at $59 for free shipping and there's a checkpoint at $99 which gets you 40% off this is genius in my opinion and this is something I'm going to steal for any e-commerce clients we work with in future so I'm just going to like add things they add up here what's really cool is you can see the bundle building up and now I have free chipping free shipping I wish there was a check mark when you actually got that point but whatever we're all good and we're going to turn this up and now I have 40% off everything and you can see your savings here I think that's a little bit hard to see but that's all good and then you proceed the checkout and you can see all your savings I think this is a super super cool one um I love it it's it's really nice and I'm sure you can also add other discount codes I'm sure there's other things you can also add on there um and I'm assuming that as this campaign goes on um there'll just be more and more stuff but this is actually a pretty sophisticated Black Friday sale uh creating your Black Friday box I think it's like it wins the Sip Award for best or most creative Black Friday sale in my opinion and the Sip award know very big deal it's it's it's huge so I'm just wondering did they build that themselves because startup idea go and just build this and make a Shopify app and it's genius I would assume I would assume that the four sigmatic guys probably did build it themselves um but I don't know no ice I I think they probably did but I mean anyone being out there being able to build something like that for their clients for Black Friday like it's guys if you're listening to this podcast and you know how to run sales and you have like some proof that you've run sales for yourself or some for some other clients or you could build that for clients you need to be reaching out to them approximately August every year actually a really cool thing happened so we actually brought in a copywriter an extra copywriter for this week and he reached out to us cold um reached out to me cold in August uh with an email which was like is your Black Friday sale planned already something like that um and he's here now sitting in the office helping us with our campaign just because we have so many campaigns running and so many emails going and I thought that was like a really clever way to reach out to us um like copywriters and people who can build things build little kind of neat little shop ideas for people during Black Friday they are needed everywhere shh don't tell anyone but I've got 30 plus startup ideas that could make you millions and I'm giving them away for free these aren't just random guesses they're validated Concepts from entrepreneurs who built hundred million plus businesses I've compiled them into to a one simple database compiled from hundreds of conversations I've had on my podcast but the main thing is most of these ideas don't need a single investor some cost nothing to start I'm pretty much handing you a cheat sheet the idea bank is your startup shortcut just click below to get access your next cash flowing business is waiting for you yeah so that's it's like another startup idea which is so you can go and build the software and or you can actually create the Black Friday agency yes oh my God yes yes and then you can that's actually brilliant no it sound like I know there's going to be people in your audience who are going like yeah whatever but actually that's excellent that's a really good idea like well yeah that's really good I love that that would work it's like because all of the ads are going to be it's your biggest week of the year don't squander it don't flub it you know it oh man that's really good we need to we might have to do that one we might have to find a team and invest in it I mean we help people run their Black Friday campaigns but just from a strategic point of view just like telling them what they should do like and and helping them with the copy and stuff and we've got all the teams literally sitting here they've flown in for this week and and we're just doing that but an agency that proactively reaches out to companies e-commerce stores and is like by the way like your I can double your sales during this week I will not you don't pay me I'll just take a cut of the just the revenue from this sale come on we're so with with what we're doing just for transparency we're only taking a cut of the money that's made so it's it's kind of like a it's not a no-brainer because we take a big cut but it is kind of a no-brainer because they these companies weren't going to run these sales in the first place so it's it's like a it's it is a bit of a win-win that dude at Black Friday focused agency which in general campaigns right so what is Black Friday Black Friday is a campaign and all of these campaigns so we run every year we run a summer sale campaign we run a Black Friday Campa campaign we've now started to piggy back on the prime day campaign the prime day sale and we're looking for other like times of the year to piggyback for example like back to school things like this piggy piggybacking on events that happened throughout the year and running campaigns during these events a lot of like SAS people um because as you know a lot of SAS people are like anti- ads and AD SU and all marketing sucks it all has to be organic that's fine but there there are massive opportunities we just looked at a lot of companies now who are running these types of things including Apple oh the big great Apple are running Black Friday sales there's just a massive opportunity out there to grow your business by piggybacking on these things and running campaigns during these times where people are expecting to be receiving campaigns um it feels like a no to me if you can do it in a way that's aligned with your brand in you know what I mean you know what I mean I don't know if I asked for your life story over there you got me with my own you got me with my own poison okay so can I show you one last really cool Black Friday sale please so you got me thinking about it because for sigmatic uh the one that you just showed is kind of like a game and let me share my screen so I got this email from Bodega Bodega is a retail shop and they sell Street Wear so I opened it up they send me like an email a week I never open it up but I I I got got with this one because they say there's a $200 Bodega gift code in this email like okay you're giving me $200 let's go Gotta open so she's open then I say oh oh yeah this code right here is worth $200 side note I I actually like I love how their their copy is right it feels like they're writing me a personal email problem is it's missing a few characters could be numbers or letters whoever can solve it and check out with it gets it first come first serve have fun and good luck and then they give you the discount code so this is taking a promo code and turning it into a game a treasure hunt type thing really cool that's cool I've never seen that before I I've not seen a company do this and it's interesting because that getting a $200 gift voucher for a company that sells stuff that probably is under $200 is almost like we've just got free stuff for you exactly that's very cool while you were showing me that I was thinking of another one but I can't remember what it was so wait while I was showing it to you you weren't listening you were thinking about your own thing you know on this podcast my only goal is to make sure that your audience is happy and so I'm trying to think of stuff the whole time and uh you know because if they don't get if they don't get what they want yeah they'll they'll just attack that's that's it um are you the actual important question is what are you buying this Black Friday week like what what things are you buying um that's a good question like really boring stuff like the I I I took stock of all the things that I buy repeatedly so I buy like the same protein powder I started taking creatine by this company called Thorn by the same one so I I I think it's like a good habit to look at the 20 things that you consume on an ongoing basis and just go and buy them at 20 to 50% off yes that's a really good point I mean I do that on Amazon or that's what I did this morning I just woke up and and you know you go into like the settings and it just says the buy again section and I like bought detergent uh I bought like some random really boring stuff but yeah I'll generally go to like the websites of my favorite clothing companies or I'll I'll go on the eight sleep website see if they've got anything interesting that I don't already have or yeah that that's a really good point just to jump on the things you're using already and just see if you can get like more of it which is why like I think one thing I buy a lot of is video games so for me for me the biggest part of this week is the Steam Sale which starts tomorrow so Wednesday and the Steam Sale is another thing that's kind of cool because they build an entire like theme and brand around their sale like they get artists to create the art for it it's like really special it looks really cool um I'm really excited to to just even see how the Steam Sale looks this year they like make it into a proper event another thing you can do for Black Friday and I heard this from a guy called Conor who's here with us at at the moment in the office and he said there was these in China for singles day something that's common is to do like almost like a QVC style thing where you have like influencers on video like for 12 hours during Black Friday or during singles day just selling stuff and talking about them so QVC telemarketing style we've thought about doing that because it would be fun we've done like a onour version of it where we were like you know doing an ironic version of QVC but I think there's definitely something to playing around with this almost like semi ironic semi funny QVC style T telemarketing thing where you're like there's only 20 of these left okay now there's 10 of them left I think that like I recently saw Coldplay Don't Judge Me I recently saw Coldplay on QVC and I was fascinated by how good it actually was like they had the they had so many little mythies so many little interesting one-off things so many bundles you couldn't get anywhere else um I'm not the biggest I I love their first two albums I have to admit and I'm not going to lie but I there was so many things there where I was like I'm not going to listen to any of this but I kind of want this handwritten thing or I kind of want this poster that no one's going to be able to get after this session I think it's kind of cool somehow it like it just like appeals to something in me yeah I wonder I wonder you know thinking about the ad strategy for a live stream like could you create a live stream on X and then promote it like I wish there was an ad unit that you can promote I mean of course you can go and do like static images and be like there's a live stream click it opens up the live stream but I wonder if there's an ad Arbitrage here we're running I mean we're going to spend at least 100K on just our own ads this week um I I hope you see our ads they're really silly this year they're they're very very very silly I think what I would do is I would have ads running three days before I would have ads running on the Monday for an event that's going to happen on the Thursday before Black Friday just so you have some time and the ads would be leading to like a fun waiting page for people to register for the live event and maybe if you register before the live event starts you're given some sort of discount code to use so you can use that discount code on top of whatever it is that you're going to be seeing during this live stream I think that would work really well and I think that would like get a lot actually I want to do that now that I've said it now I actually want to do it so yeah you have a live event the day before Black Friday and people you're you're sending ads to a landing page which is a waiting list which unlocks a discount code that can be used during the session that would work beautiful keep us posted let us know how it goes Black Friday agency done done all right uh Jonathan Courtney Jada the ice cream J cream the unscheduled CEO for you know the unscheduled j i cream thank you for being here sharing with Alpha we appreciate you thank so much um I saw maybe I'll I saw in your comments people like uh wondering like why am I sharing all this information um I just find it really enjoyable to be able to nerd out with someone and talk about all the stuff like again I do not have a Black Friday agency although now we we have to create one um and I don't um I also don't really have anything uh like it's really nice that people are reaching out but I don't really have any I can't I'm not we're not doing agency work uh for this kind of stuff so I think just stay tuned to the podcast that's the that's the way to to find out more cool stuff about this I appreciate you all right my man catch you later thank you we are out [Music]

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
I've got a close friend on the Pod right now and I mean he sold a company for a billion dollars he doesn't do podcasts really but he is doing us a favor the community a favor and he's got a few ideas that he would do so he's giving them away so you might as well listen to this full episode welcome to the Pod it's great to be here Greg it's good to see you good to see you [Music] I I mean you've got some free time ever since the the the loom exit to write some ideas and I want I'm I'm chomping at the bits like what do you got for us yeah so um I'm I'm pretty excited about this one so I you know I spent the last year more or less kind of traveling going to different countries going to different states just with friends solo um and I've I've one of the things that I'm actually really passionate about from a consumer perspective is just like how we travel today and witnessing how uh millenials especially prefer to travel these days um so the first idea which I would say is probably uh one of my favorite ideas on this list is what I'm coining the anti-rip advisor Traveler so you go on Google today say you're going to Rome Italy and you have to now build an itinerary um there have been services that have been created targeting Millennials uh around these kind of micro travel agents who can kind of design a guide uh you know if you give them the dates the budget and they could design something pretty uh Advanced for you but for 99 % of The Travelers out there travel is you know I would say a byproduct of how good an SEO engineer really is and what I mean by that is Trip Advisor ranks very highly on uh Google and Expedia ranks very highly all of the this like conglomerate Monopoly of travel sites that have been around since our you know parents were our age traveling um tend to get the most traffic so what does that do for travel it sends people to all the same places it sends them to all the same restaurants sends them to all the same you know takes them to the coliseum in the morning for a walking tour it takes them to the famous kacho Pepe restaurant that's like two blocks away from uh the Coliseum and the restaurant itself is called kacho Pepe so you know none of the locals are eating there so the idea is Tik Tock for modern travel um so right now users on Tik Tok uh these like micro influencers post these really aesthetically minimal uh Tik Tok Guides of beautiful coffee shops bookstores uh places to sit and people watch and take in the city right like this does not exist on any of these travel sites today so I'm actually helping a friend of mine who kind of had this concept um and I would love to kind of bring this to life but I when I travel I go on Tik Tok I've try to find two or three you know spots near my hotel that I should go to and I just kind of curate this own list and I went to Soul last year in May love the city incredible City very creative you know design forward city um and designed for businesses pastry shops and none of these things had popped up on uh when I when I was looking it up on trip advisor so I I think there's like this new segment for Millennials and jenes who want to travel the path less taken um and I feel like if we you know if there's an app that can kind of bring this to life there would be a a huge crowd that would be interested in it so I want to talk about this idea but before we get into the idea there's something that um I've been playing with a lot recently which is I'm curious if you have checked it out have you seen on Tik Tok the Creator search insights I have not no okay so if you haven't chance that other people haven't because I and me too I actually I only recently figured this out so if you go and you open up Tik Tok instead of searching for I don't know some whatever you weird things you people search on Tik Tok um you can actually search for creator search insight and it pulls this up uh if you're watching this on YouTube uh sorry if you're watching this on Spotify or apple go to YouTube to see what it is you have to click this and it says see what Tik Tok users are searching for and get inspired to create now it shows suggested and trending search topics um and it shows content gaps as well what you'll notice is a lot of time there's travel in here so it seems that people are using Tik Tok for instead of going to Google they're going to Tik Tok Tik Tok to your point so I just wanted to just make that note that people whatever it is you're working on look at the trending topics on on that on Tik Tok because it is worth it to to figure out what you should build because this is like one of those really big ideas but it's like where do you start right like how do you you know should you Niche it down a little bit and this is where where something like Tik Tok could help you figure that out shh don't tell anyone but I've got 30 plus startup ideas that could make you millions and I'm giving them away for free these aren't just random guesses they're validated Concepts from entrepreneurs who built hundred million plus businesses I've compiled them into one simple database compiled from hundreds of conversations I've had on my podcast but the main thing is most of these ideas don't need a single investor some cost nothing to start I'm pretty much handing you a cheat sheet the idea bank is your startup shortcut just click below to get access your next cash flowing business is waiting for you yeah and another Pro tip that I maybe it's um more popular now uh than when I first found out about it I would you know alongside Tik Tok I would go on Instagram and I would you know search if I'm if I'm going to Rome um and I want to see like since the last time I went to Rome what are all the best places for me to go to um I would go I would search for Rome and I would kind of use the Instagram map which is a great you know geolocation tool that's hidden within Instagram um and I would just zoom and there's a bunch of photos of people posting stories and it's kind of like your snap map that kind of has this uh like heat map on it to show where there's like density or like what's more popular uh and where like are people kind of going to in real time so that that has also helped me when kind of Designing um things to go see uh museums with new exhibits um that might not be as well known you know some of the more locally I I love exploring local culture when I travel so like Instagram and you know kind of to your uh Point um Tik Tok as well these are all great places to go find hidden gems with uh within the app so if you were to start something like this you know I buy the key Insight it's validated by people searching on Tik Tok What you know how how do you actually go and build it like where do you take a there so I I I think the first I would go to um I I would do my research by looking at you know what are all to to your point the Tik Tok um you know search results I would look at okay well what are the most search results and try to find a category are people looking to find coffee shops are they looking to find you know coffee art in cities like Soul are they going to bookstores what what are the top ranked kind of category of places people want to visit and then what I would do is I would kind of hack together a mobile app there's a bunch of no code tools out there low code tools um or if you want to build something sophisticated you could go kind of hire developer you could also use Claude Ai and uh and chat GPT uh there's a bunch of tutorials on how to build uh apps without knowing how to code with AI specifically and I would do is I would kind of build a directory based on cities so what I the the way that I would do that is I would kind of formulate everything into guides so I would want like a coffee guide of soul and within soul soul is such a big city um and it there should be a map where I could see these are like the top 10 most incredible new relevant design forward coffee shops if you're a coffee snop you'd love to go there I would love to go into that guide and and if you're monetizing it you could either sell it by guide so you could unlock say you get the first two coffee shops for free and it's a list of 10 and if you want to unlock it you could pay say 99 cents to unlock that guide uh now you have access to the best coffee shops and so so I would rank I would build these guides um and I would make like kind of like a video Carousel very similar to Tik Tok uh this is like what the aesthetic this is what you know the coffee is like the the general Vibes if you go on Google Maps and you go on a specific location they now have a Vibes category so it kind of just shows the uh the general charm of the place um and then I would Branch out you know from a very specific Niche such as coffee shops and bookstores to what are all the other search searches that are trending on Tik Tok and on Instagram and start to kind of build that curation um further out so the next time someone comes you know if they're not just looking for coffee shops maybe they're looking for something else uh and there there's something that's nearby to the coffee shop that based on their Tik Tok history they would like that is something that I would expand into and the content like how do you create the content so it's actually the content is already there you know like you can technically go on Tik Tok and just as an a general minimal viable product you can host these Tik Tok videos um just embed them directly into the app and be like these are you know the top local you know micro influencers who are talking about these coffee shops and this is like these are the coffee shops that you should go to um I think the beauty of Tik Tok is that it has this critical mass so as any influencer um I could kind of or even if I'm not an influencer right I could just kind of create a video seamlessly add a aesthetic pleasing sound on top of it and add some you know use cap cut or any of these video editing tools and add um captions on top of them um and you know what I would do so I live in New York City and if I were to create this and I were to create the content myself just to get the app up and running I would go to all the you know spots that I think a you know say a foreign traveler who wants to experience Soho um like a local like what are the coffee shops the wine bars the bookstores the um the streets for the best photos at Sunset um the Westside Highway you know rent a city bike get on the westside Highway bike path and ride up and down the path and you get to see uh New York City and you get to see the Hudson River um and it's especially this time of the year in the fall like I could I could go myself and create this content and host it that isn't as scalable as just kind of initially when you're ramping up um you just want to kind of get the information into the app I think what's also really interesting about this idea is there's probably a ton of like amazing I mean not probably there is the best content around local is hidden in Tik Tok videos so the the real the real question is how do you extract that in a meaningful way post it on the web with like curating it a little bit like adding uh you don't want to just pull the raw transcripts right um right so what do you do I'm just trying to think about it so if I'm if I'm trying to do something like this um Tik Tok does have an API so you can use the Tik Tok API for getting some of these trending local videos um and then you can use descript for uh trans transcription um there's also other tools I think Google has like a speech to text API as well that you can use um but then you're going to actually have to clean up the transcripts because you're you know it's not it worked in video but it won't it won't work for like a Blog so to speak so you can use uh you can use Cloe you can use chat gpts API um and then you can automate you can actually literally automate this whole process you just use zapier to eventually like post it to your WordPress Rog or whatever it is so what are you doing you're essentially making an you know the MVP you're making like an SEO machine right right um and maybe you start only with coffee shops like you become the place where wherever it is you land like if you're a coffee snob maybe you call it coffee snobs doxyz because that's probably available um but you you do it in every city and then once you do coffee shops then you know you can expand Beyond there right yeah I I I think it's important to your point to kind of start in a very specific Focus area that um you know if if if like kind of imagine yourself if you go to a new city or new country you've never been to you check into your hotel you drop your bags what is the first thing you look for on Google Maps um and or on Tik Tok or on any of these social platforms um and when you look for recommendations you know what is if you go down the list of things that the average traveler does is they probably ask their friends they probably go on Instagram and have probably saved these videos in advance and then they probably go on to Google Maps and start pinning a bunch of locations near their hotel that they should check out uh and truth be told like we don't you know we tend to um over complicate this process but instead if like you said the MVP could be if you follow those instructions you can extract that information imagine just pasting a Tik Tok link into a URL like the URL into a text field um or excuse me into a URL field and then it just kind of autog generates a written guide from that one Tik Tok video it's like in this Tik Tok video uh there was this coffee shop was mentioned here's like the link to their Google Maps this coffee shop was mentioned here's the link to their Maps um and uh and then it just kind of creates a written guide that is SEO friendly that people if they search for say coffee um in Williamsburg this guide would ideally pop up and it would also allow them to save it to like bookmarket in the app so that once they are in say Brooklyn they see that that coffee shop is nearby um so I think there's a lot of ways to kind of get started with this I you know kind of in this like postco world where travel has really taken off um a lot of airlines have posted massive uh profits just goes to show that travel is not slowing down people love experiences um they love to go to new cities they love to go to uh cities they've been to many times and try new things there so if there's an app that can kind of facilitate that for the millennial and genen z uh you know kind of generation that is very specific when it comes to traveling I think there's uh there's there's a big Market um for someone who ends up building this including myself I would love to use it you'd love to you'd love to try third wave coffee in Istanbul you know the right the right yeah you know the right Shop I actually I heard recently uh there's like a famous coffee saying around coffee snobs that once you like once you really get into coffee you're going to hate it cuz you're going to be that person that travels lands in New City and has to walk 45 minutes or take an Uber somewhere to get that first cup of coffee that is going to hit the spot for you like the diner coffee won't be good enough so um I digress I like this idea I think it's great we've talked a lot about directories on the Pod before I think that directories are only going to get more more popular I think what I'm really interested with respect to directories is how can you put directories on autopilot um start building that SEO juice and who knows where you know some of these could go um you could end up getting for all you know in the coffee business you could end up becoming an OT you know working working to create like an Expedia competitor um so you don't really know where it goes but the cool part about a directory and guides and I like that you're using the word guide because I think that's a really important word um is you're just you're building a center of gravity you're building a center of gravity around a topic um and uh it gives you a lot of Leverage uh for where to take it so I like this idea um what's your next idea um so if we stay on the topic of travel for a second um one of the things that I feel like has been broken um and it really broke during like when uh you know kind of covid had taken place um people are everywhere now people have moved to New cities you moved to Miami I moved to New York we both lived in San Francisco um our friends have moved all over the place um and there hasn't been a what I want to call like this micro social network which is a very minimalist thing it does one thing really well um and we'll get into that in a second but this there hasn't been a micro social network around where my friends are so especially in summertime when no one I mean all my friends who live in New York are all out traveling uh I want to know like if we end up overlapping the same city uh or if we're going to overlap in the same city I would love to know that in advance so we can kind of arrange some plans um maybe meet for a meal plan some stuff out but you might have noticed that Instagram had launched their kind of you could call it status updates those status updates are I would say at least in my feed 90% of it is just people telling their friends which city they're in um and I don't know if Instagram had either envisioned that that would be the primary use case for their status updates um but I think it says something really important which is friends want want to know where their other friends are so uh a lot of people and including myself I have a lot of my close friends on find my friends um and that's you know that's that's Apple's kind of take on this like call it pseudo social network um but it's it's a very flat you know there isn't much depth to find my friends and instead what I would love to see is where I could push a button it just automatically updates my location uh the feed would be incred simple it shows your friends based on your proximity to them so uh just imagine your face right next to mine it's like oh we're we're overlapping in Montreal I shoot you a text um and I'm like hey we should we should grab a meal I saw that you're in Montreal and I'm I'm sure you remember I don't know how many how many of your listeners remember this maybe this is dating us a little bit about 10 to 12 years ago uh there was a private social network called path that had kind of Taken um you know uh really the media um it had kind of taken off on its own and the whole premise of path was a privatized close social network of your close friends family members so you're only able to I think have up to 75 friends I'm not sure on the exact number of that but uh you only wanted to accept friends that were your true friends you're call it 75 best friends and you would be able to kind of see their l through a series of photos and you know videos and status updates and locations but people have been wanting a path likee social network for so long because you know Twitter is a completely different product today Facebook is a completely different product and now you know we kind of use Instagram for letting our friends know where we're at um some of us still use snap uh I think there's a vertical in which people can build this incredibly simple micro social network quick ad break let me tell you about a business I invested in it's called boring marketing.com so a few years ago I met this group of people that were some of the best SEO experts in the world they were behind getting some of the biggest companies found on Google and the secret sauce is they've got a set of technology and AI that could help you outrank your competition so for my own businesses I wanted that I didn't want to have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I didn't want to depend on ads to drive customers to my businesses I wanted to rank high in Google that's why I like SEO and that's why I use boring marketing.com and that's why I invested in it they're so confident in their approach that they offer a 30-day Sprint with 100% money back guarantee who does that nowadays so check it out highly recommend boring marketing.com so yeah let's talk about first of all I just want to say something that I always when when it comes to building a new startup social consumer social I'm always like don't do it Greg don't do it Greg don't do a Greg and then I'm like sketching it out and then it's like oh no I'm doing it um the reason the reason is it's it's playing startups on hard mode it is just so hard to do it well now I will say it what changes it a little bit is with AI now it is faster to create these products so um you don't need a $2 million and hire a team of 10 to beta test this now what you're talking about with path I think people need to study path especially you know because people have probably forgotten um someone in the comment section is going to be like I didn't forget I I I hear you but most people who are listening this have not heard of path it was 150 people up to 150 people that you can have on path and the reason why it was 150 people I don't know if you remember this is because it had to do with a sociology Theory called dunbar's number dunbar's number was the theory that human beings can only maintain about 150 connections Max at once but when you think about uh today's world in social media like we follow hundreds thousands we're seeing tweets posts Tik toks everywhere right so what was path path was the anti version of the current state of social networks now path actually ended up selling for like a hundred million to Google I think this idea which your idea which is basically like reinvent path for today's um for for today is really interesting I'm not convinced that it's the I'm in a new city like I need to you know I'm in a city and like you're in the city and like let's hang out but I think the idea around a social network called Dunbar I think the that you get like the name of it is Dunbar because then there's a story about Dunbar and oh what's Dunbar oh it's an app where you can have Max 15 people and like you can do XYZ things and then you just clone it and then you run a PR machine to get like everywhere everyone wants to write about how every Legacy Media Company hates social media so they're going to be happy to write about how you're going to try to kill it and why it's ruining your lives that's that's my take what do you think no I I I I like that I like The Branding around it too I I I think a lot of people um in in our industry who had got to play with path and you know even uh more broadly than um our industry have kind of wanted a path for 2024 2025 right what does it look like today um to your point the reason why we haven't seen one since the existence of path is because like you said consumer and social are like oil and water it's just it it's so hard to mix um almost impossible and quite nearly impossible right so so many companies have tried to build consumer social products I think there is such a demand for it but when there aren't Network effects or um you know kind of levels of scale to it it kind of really becomes difficult so if I'm the one on this app and none of my friends are on it and there's like I have some internet friends who I don't consider to be close friends where I would feel comfortable enough either sharing my location or photos or whatever um it becomes really tricky I my very specific use case was around I love you know kind of seeing where my friends are at any given time like oh cool you know they're and it doesn't have to be like the exact GPS location um it has to be like assuming we're close enough friends and we see that we're in a different city in Europe um and we have plans to kind of like meet up it it kind of creates it's a conversation starter and I feel like most social networks kind of today are you're you're kind of taking in a lot of information you're not contributing you're kind of just lurking around um so if you could kind of get the consumer to create information or to create something to discuss um or to spark a conversation that that would hopefully create uh more engagement around uh around the app but I think to your point there's a lot of ways to go around it the desire for having a closed off network with your friends because everything is so public these days uh is certainly there hopefully someone builds it and hopefully we can use it yeah and I think that with the location bit I think what was cool about uh path back in the day and like people should really look at it like when you used to open up path I'm pretty sure he used to say like good morning from Hayes Valley you know it like new your neighborhood even Hayes Valley San Francisco a neighborhood in San Francisco um so I think that if honestly like I kind of want to do this but like someone should just clone path like look at exactly what they did clone path make it like a little more shinier a little more glossier a little more beautiful in today's 2025 standards but like from a dude I hate to I hate to this publicly I'm just going to go ahead and say this cuz whatever if you're going to judge me judge me I went on Facebook the other day cuz I wasn't I wasn't no it gets worse it gets way worse I went on Facebook the uh yesterday because I wasn't sure if it was a friend of mine's birthday and I knew he I had him on Facebook so I was like oh let me check see if it's his birthday so so I go on Facebook lo and behold 45 minutes past and I'm just scrolling Facebook and the worst part about it is I'm enjoying every second of it what what were you scrolling were you looking at photos were looking at memories just through the timeline I was everywhere bro I was everywhere I I I I was like I started off on the just like the the time the the feed I was scrolling down the feed and let me open it up I was scrolling down the feed and I just loved how you know oh someone moved to Bend Oregon like I had no idea like that's an that's an you would never like I don't know if you'd post that on Instagram like you might just you might but you might not and then I got like you know a Facebook group update that was like really interesting and then I see this like someone is playing tennis and it's like a week ago right because Facebook is like not you know but my point is I started thinking to myself it would be cool like Facebook as a product is pretty amazing like the profiles that you can like yeah explain who you are and customize your profile to a certain extent is like quite interesting it just sucks because like it's Facebook and you know what I mean so what was path path was the reinvention of Facebook mobile first max 150 people someone needs to take this idea it will it will work someone could make this work and create a really nice business uh path used to monetize via selling sticker packs I believe they used to sell sticker packs and charge two three four five bucks there's a way to just charge $20 a year $30 a year and people will pay for this if you start getting a network effect and there is demand from people to do this and this is a multi-million dollar year idea you can do a bootstrap that's right and I also think I mean you look at the progression of snap as a company and where they've been able to monetize from um and uh even Instagram right it's like sponsored posts and very curated to the user sponsored posts relevant ads um I I also so there's there's this wild idea but this is very kind of like Tech forward and less um kind of steers us away from this idea but I'm going to come back to it I I I've thought about this a lot you know with kind of chat GPT launching two or three years ago now um and companies constantly trying to train their local language you know their large language models with more information um I feel like there's a future in which we will you know this the SAS subscription model which call it $8 a month $16 a month and then there's an Enterprise plan right very uh very typical SAS structure that gets replaced with being able to commit your personal data so I'm not I'm talking about like anonymized data where this data gets anonymized and then someone like Facebook can basically train on it so just like oh and we're talking not necessarily Shaw met up with Greg but it's like oh there's a connection that was made here maybe that data is relevant maybe that data is not relevant but I do think there will be at some point my hunch is a future in which we can pay uh and for premium subscriptions uh with our own anonymized data um and hopefully someone builds a path and I I do want to kind of kind of double click into your uh you know your 10 minutes of or 30 minutes of Facebook uh screen time for a second which is this kind of goes into my third idea um and this is because of something that I find myself doing quite often which is I will go into my iCloud photos I'll go I'll just open up the photos app and I'll try to find a specific memory and I'll try to create a sticker out of it so I could send it to a friend um and I'll just find myself 20 minutes deep into like looking through photos from the past so shared albums my my take on this is shared albums are where your memories go to die um I want to be able to share a in the idea here is time what I'm calling type time capsules of your shared memories so I want to be able to share a physical Time Capsule of the memories I've made with friends either on trips or just at dinner at their home you and I hosted a dinner at your place in San Francisco I actually had a memory for that on Facebook funny enough we talk about that uh that must have been eight years ago um seven years ago let's say and that was a super fun dinner but how often do we come back to that period of our lives right just like the the Beautiful Bliss of pre covid everyone living in San Francisco us hosting a dinner together and having our friends over um was awesome but if I was like oh it's Greg's birthday I want to send him a present I want to send him a memory of both of us and sure I could send him photos of us from my iCloud um or I could you know somehow curate this time capsule and send it to him that's a very personal High touch uh gift and I think for it to work it has to be ephemeral because I don't want you to feel like you're getting assuming this like takes off it you know uh gets widely adopted now everyone's sending you these time capsules and now you feel obligated to hold on to these time capsules it has to feel ephemeral enough where and obviously super curated um and it should feel as if you're reliving that memory but it's Emeral enough where you could also toss it out if you want to after holding on to it for a day a week or two weeks but that's uh that's my that's my third idea and this kind of this takes a page out of the book of path and a page out of the book of clout if you remember clout of course tell tell people what it was for people who don't remember so clout was The Social Network that really monetized on Nostalgia and what that means is um I would hook up I I would basically connect uh all of my Social Network accounts so Facebook Twitter Instagram at the time um and any other social network and clout would send me a reminder of this is before Facebook had memories built into their app uh clout this is around 2013 so we're talking about 11 years ago clot would send you a reminder of this memory you had with a friend of yours and it was done so well people humans love Nostalgia they love to look back on life and be like wow that was an incredible time I'm glad we got to like you know share that moment yada yada and it just do it it did Nostalgia so well in a social format where because I was reminded of my trip to South by Southwest at the AMX you know uh sponsored show where they had Jay-Z there um I was inclined you know clout had really clicked in on the idea of if we can send the emotions of nostalgia to this user of something that has happened you know that they posted in the past the likelihood of them sharing that out to their friends is very high so clout went viral as a result of people sharing their Nostalgia um but it failed to kind of really sustain um in a world where Facebook had the network effects and Instagram had the network effects people would only come to Cloud to see their memories and share it to these other platforms so it didn't have its own uh Network effects and ultimately led to I think they ended up getting acquired um but there's always room for Nostalgia and I think we're this is very nostalgic ironically for us to talk about we're talking about two apps from 11 years ago uh that we both loved and I think they're you know this concept of time capsules of these shared memories of memorabilia or you know photos printed out on a no card with a signature in the little box nice packaged well shipped to you sounds uh super cool and people are going to be like why are these people bringing up such old apps like why bring up clout why bring up path these thing people people don't change like human beings don't change our needs don't change the products that we create change based on how we consume it and and shifts like that but um I I like this idea I I had a I actually said something that went viral I said Nostalgia is a hell of a drug and I like this idea because I think it not only is there a business here it's also like I actually think that it'll really put smiles on people's faces I'm also one of those people that uh like just last week I I came across some old photos I agree with your thesis on this by the way uh that shared albums is where memories go to die I I sent over like five photos to my group chat of like friends and everyone was like it made their day it made their day but then those photos are going to like they're dead like they you know so there's something here and I think the catchiness of shared photos are going to die uh is is is enough to create a business around it exactly and I think there's something between a photo that you sent to a friend um you know in a text thread and a digital album that you have on your nightstand something in between needs to exist and it doesn't today uh and there's clear opportunity uh for someone to go out there and build it dude thank you for for sharing these ideas I need I need people to literally just bug go into the comment section on YouTube and we need to have this we need to have this this man on again you know we have to convince him in 2025 to come on again and to thank him so I appreciate you uh where could what do you do you have anything to plug at this point uh no just uh you know really just happy to be here happy to see you um if you w to you know I I often tweet about kind of ideas like this that I find when I travel or when I'm just kind of walking my dog on the West Side Highway um you know go follow me on Twitter uhor s DK um tweet at me if you have any ideas if you're building any things that we mentioned would love to love to take a look would love to give feedback also on Instagram wherever you can find me would love to connect beautiful all right my man this has been a treat thank you so much appreciate you having me on later baby [Music]

Title: Figma UI Design Tutorial: Design your app in 40 Minutes!
Published: 2024-11-22 17:04:23 UTC
Description:
In this episode, I am joined by Michael Riddering, Creator of the Dive Club, where we dive deep into Figma and design. Learn the best practices to level up your process for designing apps 

00:00 Intro
00:53 Designing a Landing Page
02:31 Creating Components for Efficiency
04:02 Adding Content and Typography
04:57 Finding Inspiration for Design
07:25 The Importance of Collecting Design Ideas
09:44 Iterating on Design Ideas
12:37 Best Practices for Front-End Design
17:21 Enhancing Visual Interest
29:10 Using Plugins for Design Efficiency
32:55 Inner shadows for the win
35:21 Figma vs. v0

1) Start with components ASAP
• Even before adding content, turn your frame into a component. It's not just for design systems - it's a speed hack!
• Components = one knob to rule them all. Changes propagate everywhere.

2) Inspiration is constant
• Don't start from scratch. Build a notion database of design inspo.
• "I never turn it off basically... I'm constantly, constantly, constantly dumping things in there and categorizing them."

3) Auto layout is your best friend
• It maps to Flexbox in CSS. Makes responsive design a breeze.
• Pro tip: Use Shift+A to turn any frame into an auto layout.

4) Think in multiples of 8
• Stick to 8px increments for spacing. It aligns with Tailwind's system.
• "When in doubt, you want something that's a multiple of eight."

5) Add depth with blur & blend modes
Quick visual interest hack:
1. Add colored rectangle
2. Apply layer blur (20-30px)
3. Reduce opacity (2-4%)
4. Set blend mode to "luminosity"
Instant depth!

6) Noise = texture
• Use the "Noise and Texture" plugin for a subtle grain effect.
• Set opacity SUPER low (0.5-1%). It's barely visible, but adds richness.

7) Prototype early & often
• Don't wait to add interactivity. Use variants for hover states.
• Smart animate + "Gentle" easing = smooth transitions.

8) Shadows are tricky. Use plugins.
• The "Smooth Shadow" plugin is your friend. Multi-layer shadows made easy.

9) Inner shadows for the win
Create depth with inner shadows:
• Add white inner shadow at top (2-8px)
• Add dark inner shadow at bottom (-2 to -12px)
Subtle 3D effect!

10) Figma vs. v0 vs. Framer
• Figma: Rapid ideation, divergent exploration
• v0: Quick prototypes, slightly templated
• Framer: Final 5-10%, closer to production
Mix & match for best results!

so this is going to be interesting I texted red and I was like do you want to come on the show and just do a live design session on figma because R is like the figma guy and as you're designing your your startup your idea you can just give best practices around how to use figma and you said yes here I am I appreciate it welcome to the show you know it's it's cool to be here I've definitely listened to my share of episodes and to actually see you talking back to me is kind of fun so thanks for having me I appreciate it all right shall we get into it let's do [Music] it so in thinking about the best way to go about this I have a little design task for myself this week and I thought you know what I'm just gonna kill two birds with one stone and just design it live and kind of give you a little window into my process and how I iterate obviously there are a million different things that you can learn and um just angles we could take even for this so I'm going to try to show you a good middle ground of just like all the little considerations that I'm making while building little visual improvements that you can use to make your designs look good we'll get into some like basic prototyping and kind of just see where it takes and Greg along the way if something is interesting that you want me to like double click and go down a little rabbit hole I'll just look to you to guide for context this is my website dive. Club and I also have a podcast but I'm working on a little course page I want to put up like a basic Marketplace of design courses and I have these affiliate agreements with instructors that I like and so I'm kind of thinking about how the heck do I want to design that and so let's just see where it takes us so I'm going to start by making a little card and the best way to do that is you just hit F which is going to give you a frame which is basically like your container in figma for anything it kind of works like a CSS div so if you're at all familiar with that that's basically the mental model that we're using here anytime you need a thing you make a frame you dump stuff into it so I'm going to treat this as a course card and maybe to start I'm just going to play around with what it would look like to design these as Rose now I'm going to do something that maybe a lot of people would find atypical but it's like one of my just total hacks for moving more quickly in figma and that is I'm gonna turn this into a component like as the first step before I have anything in there and a lot of people associate the word component with like Design Systems and Polaris and Enterprise and yada yada but actually like components as really hacky speed mechanisms in figma are amazing I use them all the time because my goal is like I never want to do the same thing twice like I'm trying to find ways especially really early in the process to like minimize the amount of knobs that I'm turning to make changes and so this way is I'm just giving myself one knob so right away I'm going to go ahead and duplicate this a bunch of times throw it into some kind of a container and now I have my card at the top and I can just start styling it so maybe I'll set this to like I don't know 5% opacity now you can see this is a auto layout here which I created by hitting shift a and this is basically just throwing you can throw anything into an auto layout which is just a um like a stack basically um and it really actually kind of maps to flexbox in CSS so once I do that now I can control things like the space between over here and I can start to manipulate my designs this way so it's a pretty good starting point and now I can kind of just start to dump content in and see what happens and the nice thing is I have my component so I never have to do anything twice so if I come up here maybe I'm going to go ahead and call this uh designing with AI and that'll be like the title I have some preet text Styles in here it's pretty basic type scale you can pull this from like almost any popular website you can head to like Polaris or something if you want to copy those values or uh even just pull values from Tailwind CSS is a really great spot if you're looking for like colors and typography so I'm going to go ahead and give that and I'll call that title and I'm just going to command D duplicate it and let's make this the instructor name and maybe I'll even give this a little bit of color let's just see what it looks like and this course is by mahen sale okay I have a question please so it's interesting you're you're designing from your head you know your mind so do not go and look for inspiration before you start pushing pixels great question so I actually look for inspiration constantly I never even I just I never turn it off basically so like I have a notion database and I can even give you like a YouTube link if you want to point people that way that shows how it's built but I'm constantly constantly constantly dumping things in there and categorizing them and creating all these different views like I'm a total nerd about it and so I have you know I don't know if you ever talked like David Perell he has this idea of like writing from abundance like you don't like go look for notes and start from the blank page you're like constantly contributing to this database of ideas that's kind of the way I think about it too where like a lot of these they're in my head but only because I've saved stuff before and if if I really actually don't have ideas my first step is I always open up my notion and I just start copying images and pasting them and I might even be able to find like if we go I bet I have pages with examples see look this is where I was designing the blog page the first thing I did was like I just went into my notion and I was like all right what's interesting paste it in and I'm like oh that's pretty cool and then I'll just zoom in and like recreate a little part of that and maybe I'll use it in a different way or something like that but my my very first step if I truly have no idea what I'm doing I just paste in things that I want to look at later sh don't tell anyone but I've got 30 plus startup ideas that could make you millions and I'm giving them away for free these aren't just random guesses they're validated Concepts from entrepreneurs who built hundred million plus businesses I've compiled them into one simple database compil from hundreds of conversations I've had on my podcast but the main thing is most of these ideas don't need a single investor some cost nothing to start I'm pretty much handing you a cheat sheet the idea bank is your startup shortcut just click below to get access your next cash flowing business is waiting for you great yeah I I'm the same way by the way the exact same way I mean that's yeah it's like everyone everyone that's like actually good at this stuff is like they are collectors of design they're not just creators of design like they take that part pretty seriously and it really really helps so like notice what you like notice the little details constantly ask yourself why you like something when you see it and I think that's like a big way to make this part easier where you don't feel like you're just shooting in the dark so I'm going to keep going with this examp Le here and another kind of like even mental model for the way that I think about design is I kind of almost approach it like I have this spreadsheet in my head too where it's like okay what M metadata do I have like in this case like I have my title I have my name I also have like the length of the course these are cohort based courses so maybe I'll make this I don't know little bit gray see what I just did there I I'm using the number keys to decrease the opacity so like this is white but if I can just type six on my keyboard it's automatically decrease that opacity and when I have like backdrops it's a really easy way to bring that Hue forward and make sure that it looks good so let's just make this four weeks and let's see we also have a price so maybe this will be like 8.99 and if I hit zero I can just bring that back up to 100% And you know this is kind of getting a little bit interesting maybe I'll maybe I'll bring an image in at this point um so I actually what I would do for an image is if you hit R you can just draw a rectangle and for any rectangle you can change the fill like this but I actually kind of like just copying from my clipboard so I'm a big raycast person so I have a bunch of images copied on my clipboard and I'll just go ahead and grab one from aen like this which is going to populate everywhere one of the new features that figma has released is the ability to remove a backg ground which is kind of nice so if you open up command K like any kind of software app you're going to be able to get this little menu here and you can just type remove background and that's going to go ahead and run on all of these instances and while I'm playing with this I might get to the point where I'm like actually I hate this I don't think it looks good at all which happens about you know 14 15 times in this exploration process so here's what I do in that case I'm going to go ahead and duplicate this whole frame command D and I'm going to go now I have two instances of this now because I have this main component these are all components here but I don't want them to be components anymore I want to preserve this as a piece in my iteration flow so the plugin that I really like is called destroyer and if you do Destroyer destroy instances this is just going to remove every single component in that frame so now it's frozen in time and it's not going to iterate and now I can just hop back here and keep changing things like maybe I want this to be a circle and we'll add like a little maybe there's like a background here so I'm going to go ahead and duplicate this call this BG and then you know I have some colors so maybe I'll make that blue if I hit two I can decrease the opacity it's like okay that's getting kind of interesting if I group these and I'm going to turn these into a little Auto layout and you can get to the point where you're like okay that's you know there's something there maybe but I don't really like it and so I'll just do it again and I won't do this that many more times but I'll probably do this 20 times when I'm actually designing it's just destroy the instances keep on going so I'm always designing in one frame and a nice little hack and and what I think really helps when I'm designing is like I'm looking at my monitor right here but I have the design at 1X on my laptop in prototype mode so like if you go to figma decom open up this file and just hit the play button then you can have this open so I'm always seeing it like at the real size on my laptop while I zoom in and make changes and so that's kind of nice because I'm always going to have this leftmost Frame as the source of Truth and then just see it update in real time on my laptop so let's say that actually I really don't like this at all and uh maybe I want to have some kind of like a larger card so I'm actually just going to set this to wrap which is just changing the auto layout like um like flexbox and let's just you know for right now let's just delete a couple of these and see what it looks like to do two at a time that's kind of maybe uh you know let's just make this a little bit bigger make the card vertical all right let's set this to there we go okay so maybe this is actually a better starting point and if I come back in here and I have my content here let's just like just keep exploring different ways like this is honestly like the the if you want to be a good designer it's like actually just about trying more things than everyone else and So the faster that you can try things the the better that you're going to be because you just kind of got to get through all of the slop so let's see if actually you know if we expand this image like this and then um I'm actually going to let's put this here and U maybe we'll have a little like an arrow icon or something like that to indicate that this is interactive so uh plugins are your friend anytime you want to do icons if you're hunting individually it's going to suck you kind of just got to pick a library and stick with it my favorite by far is phosphor so again if you do command k type phosphor you can open up this plugin and it's going to give you all of the icons that you could ever want and they're all going to look beautiful together so I'm gonna search for an arrow and let's pick let's go this one we're just GNA go a standard Arrow right I'm going to drag that in here it's going to appear on all of my canvases let's make it white all right not bad I think I'm going to shrink this and now Watch What Happens here here so and r r just start interrupt how how much are you thinking about actually engineering some of these components for example you know maybe it makes more sense to use something like Lucid um or you know that is that is more friendly to CSS for example like are you thinking are you thinking my question is this are you thinking about how do I make a beautiful page or am I thinking how do I make a beautiful page that's going to connect easily with framer or something like that great question I'm pretty much always thinking about how it's going to be built with the disclaimer being like I'm actually like a little bit more of like technically minded designer like I'm not an artist I can't draw anything I don't even have a I don't even sketch things like just that part doesn't come natural to to me but I know how front end works and so a lot of the decisions especially as I'm fine-tuning things I'm going to use those best practices and honestly if you're building in figma using Auto layout it almost just comes out of the box a little bit free because if you can build something in Auto layout that means that it's very easy to build in Flex box that doesn't mean that you necessarily have to like you can get away with it but it's going to like if you don't use Auto layout and you're just randomly positioning things in the frame that's effectively the equivalent of just absolutely positioning something in CSS which like yeah it's it's possible but it's not great it's not it's always you you probably want to avoid that um so even something like this so like I have a frame I'm gonna hit shift a to turn like if we zoom in here by the way hitting enter allows you to drill in in the canvas and then shift enter is moving back up that's like how I Traverse the layer tree really really a great way to move more quickly basically so you can see like I made a little wrapper on this icon and I'm actually going to hit shift a to turn that into an auto layout which is kind of getting to that point that you were talking about and once I do that I can just change the padding over here so you can see I just put eight pixels of padding around it and maybe I'll just give it a little I don't know subtle background change the Border radius and that's going to map really well like if a developer is building that it's going to be one to one with how they would do it in CSS so let's just make this kind of look better because it still doesn't look great so I'm going to give it a little bit of like a border radius and let's throw these into an auto layout and another thing that I'm doing is almost certainly like if you're building this especially even if you're using like vzero and you don't even have dedicated developers everything's built on Tailwind like the modern web uses Tailwind you can't really get away with it and so you're going to get a lot of values out of the box when and doubt you want something that's a multiple of eight and then that's going to be built into the Tailwind syntax so for something like this this is the equivalent of uh pl12 because it's 12 Time 4 is the way that tail one works so I'll probably try to stay with those types of values whenever I can um same thing here like we'll make this maybe four pixels apart and okay now let's start to make this styled a little bit more interesting and the way that I'm going to do that to start is I want to bring a little bit more color into this so something that I do a lot in my visual language for dive is I like to play with like lighting and blur so here's like a simple way that you can add a bit of visual interest to your designs I'm going to go ahead and hit R which is going to give me a rectangle previously I added the image this time I'm going to just give it a color fill now use my blue and same thing as like a lot of different software if you use the little brackets so command bracket left that's how you move things down in the layer tree so I'm just going to move that to the back real quickly and I'm going to go to effects and I'm going to click this little drop down and select layer blur another CSS property and I can crank up that value maybe to like I don't know 20 30 and if I hit remember my numbers on my keypad change the opacity so maybe I'll bring that down to like four it's kind of getting interesting so once I do this maybe I'll even increase this more cool that creates a little bit of an interesting visual effect right yes another thing that I like doing a lot which is if you go to this little guy here it says apply blend mode again straight from CSS I'll be honest I don't know what 90% of these does I I'm convinced that no one actually knows what they do there is one that is used all the time which I kind of wish somebody told me earlier which at the very bottom is Luminosity which is basically saying hey take this image and just let all of the colors below bleed through and make it essentially like a really like a tinted black and white I think that looks good I use it all the time so that's starting to get a little bit more interesting let's just maybe we'll increase this blur a bit and decrease the opacity okay kind of get getting there and all right so that's like that's something right that's that's we're we're getting there another thing that is an easy way to spice up your designs especially when you're playing with like gradients and lighting and things like that is adding just like a bit of noise and texture goes a really really long way so in this case I want to just add a bit of graininess to this so I'm G to add another rectangle and if I hit r I'm just going to drag it across everything these are your constraints so I'm just going to say hey pin this all the way to the edges and remember we can do command and the back bracket to move it all the way to the back and now this is another plug-in that is incredible you can use it in so many different ways so noise and texture this top one if you open this up you can do all kinds of really crazy visual effects in here it actually even gives you some like interesting shaders out of the box like you can go wild with this thing for now I kind of just want like a really simple noise so I'm going to go ahead and hit add and H that looks okay let's remove the gray um obviously that looks like trash so let's go ahead and increase the amount we'll update it and then all I'm going to do is just use those keypads and decrease the opacity so put it down to like one if I go 0 five it's down to 5% all right so that gives like a little bit of visual interest to it right um at this point we're just going to start tweaking things and what I might do at any point right now is just duplicate so I have another like saved bookmark I'm that's like basically how I'm treating this is like I'll save the bookmarks let's run Destroyer again okay cool now let's keep going so once we're over here maybe I'm GNA give this a border and we'll go white I want it to be pretty subtle though so you know maybe it's like 10% okay it's getting a little bit more interesting quick ad break let me tell you about a business I invested in it's called boring marketing.com so a few years ago I met this group of people that were some of the best SEO experts in the world they were behind getting some of the biggest companies found on Google and the secret sauce is they've got a set of technology and AI that could help you outrank your competition so for my own businesses I wanted that I didn't want to have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I didn't want to depend on ads to drive customers to my businesses I wanted to rank high in Google that's why I like SEO and that's why I use boring marketing.com and that's why I invested in it they're so confident in their approach that they offer a 30-day Sprint with 100% money back guarantee who does that nowadays so check it out highly recommend boring marketing.com all right so at this point I can do a lot of different things I'm gonna go ahead and just increase the number of my cards all I did was just duplicate that row and I have a bunch of content that I can add in here I'm probably going to save that to the end just because it's pretty tedious let's mess around with like just simple prototypes right like how do we make this interactive we kind of want to feel our designs and I'm a big fan of like prototyping quickly because like how that hover State behaves is like I think that's a really big part of it right so we have this component here what I do at this point which I feel kind of decent about it and I want to start adding some interactivity I'm actually going to drag it up here and let's see 430 maybe we'll make this like 400 okay now if you want to add a hover state to something in figma you make it a component and then if you come over here to this very top right see how it says add variant go ahead and click on that and now we have what we can call a hover so this is going to be default this is hover and now I can make any changes to this variant and attach them with a little prototyping interaction which I'll show you in a second so let's say you know what maybe the blur grows a bit on Hover and let's go ahead and maybe we'll increase the the background so it kind of Pops maybe the Border too okay that's let's just see what that looks like so I'm going to go ahead and hit prototype and maybe I'll just do that a little bit more slowly so click on Prototype or you're by default in design mode up in the top right if you hit prototype then you can actually just click and see this little blue dot you can drag that to a different component variant so in this case I want to change from the default to the hover when do I want to do it well when it is hovering by default it'll be on click I'm going to change that to while hovering and this is where you can kind of change the animation presets we don't want instant because we're not Savages we want it to feel good so we'll go ahead and hit smart animate which is basically just telling figma hey smoothly transition between these two states and I like this gentle right here that's kind of my default feels pretty good because there's like a little bounce to it 800's pretty long though let's make it like 400 so at this point we can hop into prototype mode and just see how this feels and remember I probably already have this on my laptop if I'm doing this in real time so if I hide this UI you can see all of these are interactive now when doing this this is where I'm like okay how does this feel what do I actually what do I actually want from this and pretty common UI pattern is like oh you want like a little bit of lift right like you you want it to kind of feel like it's popping there's like some shadows and the way to not have a good time in figma is to just do it manually and like go in here and do effects and add a drop shadow and tweak it like it's like really hard the best Shadows are not one Shadow layer like that's just not how good Shadows work so my hack is to use a plugin and my favorite plugin for this is if we hit command K again to run plugins smooth Shadow no spaces really really easy way to create beautiful Shadows so if you click on this it's actually going to give you little easing curves and you can play around with the alpha on a slider which is just the transparency so I like to take it like further than I actually want it and then I'll like slowly back it off but honestly you don't have to mess with it too much like everything out of the box is gonna look good so if we do that you can see like okay now there's like it's like elevating a little bit it's getting more interesting maybe there's something there now at this point maybe you're like you know what actually I don't like the the layout or I want to change the button a little bit and I'd probably run my Destroyer workflow but you've seen that a few times so let's just like change this around a bit now remember we don't want to do anything twice so what figma gives us is when we're editing a component there's this little icon up here called multi-edit variance or you can just hit q and that's going to allow you to make a change in any frame and it will populate everywhere so again you don't want to do things twice so maybe I just want to drag these on top of each other yeah and let's make sure that they're aligned nicely okay okay it's pretty good and actually what I really want is I want to add some text so I'm going to go ahead and hit T and just type um let's see view okay so that obviously looks ridiculous so how do we make this better well see where my layer is it's inside of my icon container I don't want that I want it inside of this Auto layout so watch what's going to happen here see how that automatically adjusted that's the beauty of Auto layout it's dynamically setting the width so that looks pretty interesting um maybe I'll just increase like the padding and note I'm still in this multi-edit mode so I'm not making these changes in two spots which is pretty helpful so let's like increase the padding a little bit 16 okay now let's hit Q again to exit multi-edit mode because in the default State maybe I actually want it to look like that and let's set a fixed height so this is always the same maybe it's 40 okay all right I'm going to increase the opacity here just a bit let's just see what that looks like okay that's something and this is only able to work because everything's set to Auto layout and I have it set to Smart uh smart animate so like just to see how you should not be doing it is if you're going to go into prototype mode here and set this to instant note the difference pretty Herky jerky right so when I'm using figma and obviously I'm using figma wrong but I've I only have a few a couple a couple of plugins I'm using when I'm watching you on figma it seems like you have a a host of of plugins that you're using um what's your recommendation to people how many plugins and and and could you rattle off kind of like the ones that you use the most that people should should should be using so honestly I actually feel like I use way less plugins than a lot of people there are people that use a lot of plugins I typically like plugins for really just two different buckets of workflows one is visual effects like that noise and texture or like the smooth Shadow just like things that would be super tedious or maybe not even like within my skill set to make like I'm not going to make animations for instance that's one bucket and honestly noise and texture and smooth Shadow that's pretty much it in that bucket that's pretty much it the other is more like workflows and what I just showed you is like how I use the destroyer and this is like what all my figma files look like by the way is just like you can see the design evolving going left to right and then I have the source of Truth here that is possible through the Destroyer plugin the other one that I use all the time is uh content re which is really really nice so one bucket that I'm like using all the time is just like you want to get a bunch of related content into a page maybe it's populating a table maybe it's filling a design with images and something that is really helpful in that world is is this kind of this combo that I use which is twofold one is you want to select maybe like all of the images for instance and I want to change the head shot across like a giant array of components the way that I'll do that is running simil layer or like select layers and know you can say select similar layers okay watch what happens when I click this now I can go ahead and search for the image oh hold on by name I want to select layers by name now I can go ahead and search for the image I can do it an exact match if I want now I have every single one of those images selected at this point now this is where content re becomes your best friend because you can run this and it's basically going to give you a bunch of defaults out of the gate so that could you know you can just come in here and select like avatars for instance you can even add your own folders of content it's like I even created one for instructors for instance and you can quickly apply and it will change everything all at once I've never actually tried this before I'm going to see if you can remove background on a bunch of images simultaneously I'm skeptical yeah that's not going to work but that combo move is pretty helpful outside of those I really don't use that many actually and I think a big part of it is like figma has added a lot of workflow enhancements and like little tiny things like how I was making bulk changes here by hitting Q like that stuff that used to be a plugin now it doesn't have to be a plugin so like figma out of the box has actually gotten pretty good I don't think that you should stress out about having to build this repertoire of like 20 different plugins great love it yeah okay so before I I you know head off here there's one little styling tweak that is kind of another one of those things that just took me too long to figure out how to do or that it was even possible but it goes a really long way which is you know I think a lot of the designs that are becoming more popular today have a little bit of depth depth and texture we've added the texture we have a shadow but something that you can do to add a bit more visual interest is using inner Shadows actually so I have my component up here and if you go to the design you'll see I have all of the drop Shadows which were added from the smooth Shadow plugin but what you can also do is add an inner Shadow and we want to use an inner Shadow to create a little bit of a rounded feel on our Corners so what I'm going to do is set this to White see how that added that up at the top like this and you can kind of tweak these values I typically go somewhere in the range of like 28 and maybe you decrease this opacity a bit so it's softer but you can see that it plays it makes it feel like lighting is kind of shining over the edge and you can pair that with another one at the bottom and you want to do this one to -2 you can see it adds it down there and since this is dark mode it's probably going to be a bit darker maybe this is up to 12 Okay cool so if we go back to our hover State here see how it's not just popping out but it's kind of rounding and bending a little bit it's like a subtle visual effect that you don't realize how often you see it on the best designs today and honestly I think I probably designed products for like seven or eight years before I realized that you could play with inner shadows and I would say that it's kind of like it's it's a trend right now and it's like actually really simple to add that kind of 3D curvature so if you're trying to create again like a little bit more visual interest inner Shadows are your best friend and I could you know tweak and iterate on this for the next three hours but hopefully it gives you at least a few little tips and tricks that you can keep in your back pocket not only about how to style things nicely but also just how to go from zero to something that looks like this a little bit more quickly than you know manually making all these changes in a bunch of different frames it looks beautiful honestly and uh before you go though I just have one last question which is why should people go into figma in a vzer world you might not get the you asking that question thinking that I'm gonna defend figma I'm not I'm not gonna defend honestly I I think that figma is fantastic for doing what I'm doing here to just be generative get as many ideas out as possible because the fact is like you can iterate more quickly in this world you can expl you can explore more Divergent ideas like everything that VZ is going to give you is going to feel tame slightly templated figma is the way to like push visual ideas and really figure out what you want to make but even for myself I've had my design process especially for like web design for instance dude it's changed man like I'm in framer a lot nowadays like a lot like whenever like a few weeks ago I was designing a new website for a client like I used figma to explore a wide array of ideas and just throw paint at the wall but once I got to the point where I was like okay this I feel pretty good here I'm going to move to framer build it get that final like five to 10% in something that is a little bit more in the medium and then I'll probably work on like the other pages of the website directly in framer so I I do believe that the more people are building their ideas in code-based tools the better way I think about it is figma is almost like a piece of paper and you have a a a pen and you're drawing actually you don't even have a pen you have a a pencil you're sketching out your idea and maybe you're writing out uh your idea but uh you know the word processor Microsoft Word is is your is your vzer of the world right like you're going to get more templatized productized stuff which has its place but I think that starting uh INF figma is often a great place to start I think it's still the best place to start I think that we are kind of staring The Next Step change in software creation in the face right now and you have like the early adopter that are tinkering with it but like even the way we think about a spectrum of fidelity is about to get shaken up because right now we have like High Fidelity which is a really goodlooking UI in figma but then there's also code that matches that onet to one and once that line blurs all of a sudden I wonder if figma has more of a place earlier in our process where it's like lower Fidelity we're exploring ideas and then maybe we are using a to like V zero maybe figma starts to dabble in this product space a little bit but this idea of having high fidelity design and High Fidelity code be separate that does not feel like it's going to exist in the long run to me 100% R this is this has been awesome uh where could people learn more about you and the stuff that you're building great question I spend way too much time on Twitter so ridore design is kind of my hub for everything but right now my kind of baby and the thing that I'm spending spending the most time on is dive. Club so I have a podcast where I'm interviewing designers Founders even Engineers that are at the Forefront of all of this new tooling and most interesting startups and that's kind of where I am trying to like learn and share all of the things on my mind so beautiful well dude this has been fun I I'm I hope people I hope people learn something here and and I hope people have a takeaway of of just being a little more confident within figma and uh just get in there get your hands dirty I think that's probably the best place the best way to learn right it's you can you can watch things like this up the wazu but if you're not actually playing with the tools it's not going to really it's not going to process open up a new file just type f on your keyboard and draw it somewhere on the page you're in it now that's right all right my man I'll catch you later see y see y [Music] down baby

45:04 HoldCo Conference

1) What's a Holdco?
It's owning multiple businesses but not running any of them day-to-day.
Think Warren Buffett lite - you're the maestro orchestrating a portfolio of companies.

2) Why go Holdco?
• Diversify risk
• Create asymmetric bets
• Design your ideal lifestyle
• Leverage your passions
Girdley: "I tap dance to work every day, even when things are sucky."

3) Types of Holdcos:
• Roll-up (same biz, diff locations)
• Platform (related businesses)
• Pure Holdco (unrelated businesses)
• Conglomerate (big daddy version)
Pick your flavor based on your interests & expertise!

4) How to start your Holdco journey:
1. Have a plan
2. Define your goals
3. Design your org structure
4. Consult lawyers & tax pros
5. Build your all-star advisory team
6. Execute & iterate
7. Optimize for happiness!

5) The secret sauce? 🤫
• Low-cost tech makes it easier than ever to incubate new businesses.
• Girdley: "You can do that same business they built off the ground for a few $1000"
• Asymmetric bets FTW!

6) Centralize or nah?
• Depends on your asset types & personal strengths.
• Girdley keeps it "radically decentralized" - know thyself!
• "Don't try to do things that I know I suck at."

7) Who's it for?
Not everyone! But if you:
• Love variety
• Hate micromanaging
• Want to build long-term wealth
• Crave a custom-designed career
...Holdco life might be your jam!

8) Ready to dive in?
Start with ONE successful biz, then expand.
And if you're serious, check out Girdley's Holdco conference in Utah next spring!

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
I describe hold coing as you own multiple businesses and you don't run any of them uh is is the way I think about it and the way most people practice kind of this idea of being an being a hco entrepreneur and you have to understand if you're going to get into whole coing or entrepreneurship or anything like you know what drives you in terms of your passion right and then how do you craft the business around making sure that why and that mission that you've been put on this Earth to kind of create like that that portfolio of assets or that job for you like reflects that and makes makes it so you can live your best life which like I'm super stoked to hear you saying you're living your best life so kudos to [Music] you Michael girdley one of my favorite people and I run a holco um but I'm actually new to this I've only been doing this for four and a half years I feel like when I when I need some Banger advice on what to do with hold Co girdley is my number one call um what are people going to learn today by the end of this episode yeah yeah well I think um number one I think we'll go through and kind of expose people to the hold Co strategy it's a different strategy from the way most people think about entrepreneurship talk about I think the different types of hold co uh we'll be able to talk about how to put your own holdco together if you decide you want to do this uh we'll talk about some of the mistakes I see people make and like you I feel like I'm still learning a lot this year has been you know uh let's say a humbling year in terms of dealing with a lot of stuff going on and I've learned a lot about H H coing this year so we can talk about that stuff and then um we're talk about some of the just tactics that I've seen people do uh in terms of you know who do you need to have around the table who are the right advisers all that kind of stuff so that's a lot to try to cram into 45 minutes but we'll see how far we get if very least if I could just expose more people to understanding this is an option uh and if it's right for you it's right for you that's great um then I'll consider this a win and hopefully we'll have fun too that's also goal number one of course all right well let's uh let's get our hands dirty by the way this is the first time I've ever prepared slides for a podcast so great job picking like a good topic and giving me homework I think it's really good so uh called This Hold Co one-on-one one1 um so let's move on to the next slide here um so you know the way I talk to people about what hold CES are is it's a unique entrepreneurial strategy and it's something that uh I think a lot of us have been exposed to by seeing some big corporations like Brookshire hathway and stuff like that um but I started to get into it when I started to see people doing this kind of unique entrepreneurial strategy that's different and the way I kind of describe it to people is that the classic way people have gotten into entrepreneurship is you own one business and you run that business right and that's the way most of my friends are right they own a business 98% of their net worth is tied up in that business they're the CEO of that business and they wake up and every day they work on that uh I describe hold coing as kind of the opposite of that right you you own multiple businesses and you don't run any of them uh is is the way I think about it and the way most people practice kind of this idea of being an being a h Co entrepreneur so yeah so you have like I think the Spectrum so most of us are familiar with Warren Buffett um you know he's somebody that everybody espouses to kind of be like um you know I have some thoughts about the Mystique of Warren Buffett I think a lot of it is really crafted I think there's a lot of BS there that people buy into um that he has this holding company and he doesn't really have to work very hard like that's great but for the rest of us we have to work hard um especially those of us that don't have the benefit of being in business for 90 years like he has but the other end of spectrum and like where I play is this kind of idea of a personal holding company I think you you have the same kind of idea Greg as you think about your Universal stuff yeah absolutely yeah I mean the way I see it is uh I set up my holding company with the thesis that uh uh Community Based products outperform non-c commmunity based products so when you start with an audience and you build a community that's just the a great way to create a moe have customers lined up and all of our businesses are based on that yeah Super Genius um my stuff and we'll talk about it because I think I have a different kind of thesis around stuff is just a hodge podge of things that I like working on that's the core thesis so whe that works or not we'll see well I mean what's the scale of your holding company if you're if you're able to talk about it uh I tend to talk about these days in terms of employees so across all the businesses are about 600 people working there right yeah so it's working uh it's working something's working something's working there we still there's still 600 people with jobs uh that are good jobs so I'm excited about that um cool so yeah um I've gotten out of like a lot of people and maybe have opinion on this a lot of people on social media like talk about like Revenue numbers and stuff as a way to measure scale and impact and like I've really gotten away from it just because I find it so disingenuous and also people are kind of numb to it so anyway that's why I don't talk about it that way anymore um so this I pull up this slide here and it's cutting it off so let me see if I can fix that um but basically the idea here is the difference between like like being a VC where you like are an angel investor where you invest a lot of things and being a holdco to me is holdco like has a significant ownership stake in all these businesses and you as a hco owner or a hco operator like you might own 30% or 60% or 80% of individual businesses and you have either a controlling interest or you have a significant amount of influence on that business so kind of the difference for me from somebody that's like an angel investor or VC versus like an actual hold cooperator is like you are in these businesses like you're a real owner of these businesses or at least either majority or a big significant stake and like if it's not like you're not a whole co owner if you're like a 05% owner of 42 different startups which I know a lot of people are there's nothing wrong with that but that's totally different from from this shh don't tell anyone but I've got 30 plus startup ideas that could make you millions and I'm giving them away for free these aren't aren't just random guesses they're validated Concepts from entrepreneurs whove built $100 million plus businesses I've compiled them into one simple database compiled from hundreds of conversations I've had on my podcast but the main thing is most of these ideas don't need a single investor some cost nothing to start I'm pretty much handing you a cheat sheet the idea bank is your startup shortcut just click below to get access your next cash flowing business is waiting for you okay and just to clarify one thing so when I talk about startups I do like mostly Tech startups I we do do some agency stuff um but it's mostly Tech startup stuff I think a lot of the stuff that you do you have you have a mix of non- tech and Tech right so my question to you is uh holding companies what type of businesses can be in them yeah so it's a pretty blank canvas in terms of how people want to approach it and it's a it's a big label when I talk about holding companies I think you can have all kinds of different businesses in there um you can have asset different asset classes as well so in my world like I own not only like big chunks of real businesses and I'm on the boards of those and I'm in there with the management you know supporting them and that sort of stuff there's also like real estate assets so like I have a a big portfolio of real estate um that I control and that's not being an investor in somebody else's fund that's like literally stuff like you go look at the deed and like my names on it so you know when when I look at the definition of a holding company and we'll talk about the different types here in the next couple slides um you really have a lot of freedom to Define what sort of assets you want to have in there and you're holding basically Equity right ownership of those things so um those could be a portfolio of high growth startups if you figure out a way to own big chunks of those things you know where you're not not a passive investor in them like you could totally do that if you wanted to be agency and services businesses you can totally do that if you wanted to be a mi a mix of different stuff whether it's tech tech and non-tech like I do you can totally do that as well um it all kind of ties back to the world you want to create for yourself which is kind of the fundamental theme of of hold coing for me like like ultimately I think a lot of people create a situation where they let their business dictate the lifestyle they're going to have and what they're going to be doing every day and all that kind of stuff and like you for example Greg are like super passionate about Community you talk about it all the time like the amount you you write about it on Twitter like clearly you're super passionate about community so like you've created a world in which your hold code like ties into your passions and the same thing for me like I'm passionate about a bunch of different spaces and I've created a world for myself as a whole coowner where like I get to work on all those types businesses all the time which honestly people ask me like you know how are you enjoying doing a hold company holding company and the truth is I've never had more fun in my entire professional career and it's because it's the most creative I feel like you can get because you've you design a world for yourself where it's just oh I'm really interested in all these businesses and I just get to come in be creative and then almost be like a fun Uncle instead of a parent um which is a place to be yeah let me jump ahead because I think this really I mean this a really good topic like for me for me I think that when you do hold coing you really craft a world for your business where it serves you in terms of how you want to be living your every day so like I think you just described like you love like advising the the GMS and CEOs that run the businesses you love you know working on something that's very passionate passionate for you in terms of community and then tying that back back into supporting those folks but I don't think either you or I is really passionate about being in there like making the trains run on time and optimizing those things and you know I think that's one of the key things I talk to people about is like you have to understand if you're going to get into whole coing or entrepreneurship or anything like is that really you know what drives you in terms of your passion right and then how do you craft the business around making sure that why and that mission that you've been put on this Earth to kind of create like that that portfolio assets or that job for you like reflects that and makes makes it so you can live your best life which like I'm super stoked to hear you saying you're living your best life so kudos to you thank you I only say it and I say it only because I want more people to to do this you know I think there's probably a bunch of people who are in jobs or starting companies that are a bit bored or whatever and I didn't know this was a viable option until I just stumbled into it and that's why you're here uh the I mean the funny thing for me is like I stumbled into it as well right and the reason um the reason I got there was I was owning and operating a single business that was doing really doing really well and like I wasn't fulfilled right at a certain point like more money doesn't make you happier and all that kind of stuff and like I realized I wanted to be living in a creative space I wanted to be teaching I wanted to be helping other folks and I got more joy out of helping people like say for examp example like finding a CEO role in one of my companies and like being very excited for that role and growing and being their best self right and then being there for them to help them grow help them when they had really hard problems and then support them kind of in their personal vision for their life and like that is what makes me super happy Believe It or Not Greg there are people who find a lot of joy out of like grinding it out in one business and being in the details and like making the trains run on time I am the opposite of that person and like so for me my journey to get into hul coing I didn't even know the term it was just like I was Bor AF in one business and I needed to go be creative and start you know doing other stuff where I felt like I could be my my best person my best self all right so anyway I uh I jumped all over the place um so yeah so there are different types of H Co so we talked about what what you're doing like thematically Tech businesses uh around a specific platform that's where I would kind of describe your business so the slide I have here talks about um the four different types of hold co uh so a rollup most people are pretty pretty um pretty much understand that um I think our our my Twitter buddy I don't know if you're connected to him R Zeller is one of these folks he has a a portfolio of non-f feris foundaries that he's U bought over time he's a former investment banker got out of that whole thing uh lives up in Minneapolis great guy and he owns just a portfolio of these businesses that are Regional nonfer foundaries so they like produce like the types of metal like fabric for a local area and like there's like five it's five to 10 guys in a like a basically like a warehouse like taking orders and producing parts for manufacturers or different businesses and stuff like that so I would describe him as a rollup which is something where they have just basically a commoditized business or type of service where each entity in the business of the holdco is the exact same thing um and then I would describe your business as this platform type which is like you have a you have multiple categories but they all kind of group around this single idea right so your single idea is this idea of community and how do you like Drive the your your knowledge there and your experience there uh as something that can create a platform where all the entities like win together and I think that's really strong um there's a couple other types here I live in this kind of pure holdco thing which is basically like your Brookshire hathway idea which is like you own two three five 10 businesses and like you super I those and coordinate amongst them um but there there's no theme they're just kind of like a a set of Holdings and U you know I'm in everything from kind of fireworks to software to Media now so but the good news I'm passionate about all of those things so that's where it is um cool hold Co I mean obviously a situation where it's advantageous for a hold co owner um you know you can do some certain stuff that's that's typical in terms of good business hygiene providing a COR corporate Shield uh making management easier you can maintain ownership and things so just talking about kind of the structure of how people typically do this you know you create an entity and then that owns portions of other entities whether those are you know limited Partnerships or uh corporations or any that kind of stuff um cool so then this is where I think I start selling people on why it's cool to do a h c but is there anything like that comes to mind for you that we should talk about before I kind of go into that how do you think of you know and I'm talking to mostly the American uh uh Founders here but how do you think about LLC s corpse C Corps I know you're not a lawyer or anything like that but do you have any any Frameworks for thinking about how to set up some of these businesses yeah yeah so definitely have a framework for think about number one talk to a lawyer that's my number one framework all the time um so but but in terms of how to to do those the way I'm actually personally set up is everything rolls up to me personally like I I don't actually have a brook haway style um burst your haway style holdco because like there's no reason to like it's just another tax return I would have to fill out and it's just annoying so um but there are other situations where say you're like you know sea and Xavier from enduring Ventures where you would want to have a C Corp uh at the top tier and in their case like they have outside investors you know at the very top of the holdco and then there are individual entities that are either pass through entities or C Corps um that live down there so you know at a high level for North American folks um you have to make a decision based on the outcomes you want to have for your holdco as to how you structure things and allow cash to move between different entities um and there are certain types of situations in which you would want to have a pass through entity which is a sub chapter S entity under the US rules and there are times in which you would want to have a C Corp um which is a subchapter C corporation so most of the big corporations are sub chapter C corporations um and then the way I I feel like I'm getting ready to give a legal lecture on this stuff so this is why you should call a lawyer don't listen to some guy at a podcast but um there are times in which you want to have passor enties and there are times in which you want to have C Corps and it all ties back to what the cash flows are going to look like what the owners structure is going to look like and then what the eventual exit for that individual holding or the the hold Co in general is going to look like so uh I think maybe I'm explaining it in a way that uh my number one message is talk to a lawyer and talk to your tax um talk to your tax adviser and actually most people Greg that are doing um doing hold Co they end up like you don't go to loan like one of the things I talked about when I when you know I put together a course on all this stuff um but talked about like this All-Star team of people that are folks that are there to help you make these decisions because there's a a complex Set of Legos that get put together to establish how your hold code should work and that's like a CPA an accountant a Tax Advisor structuring attorney transaction attorney if you're going to be buying and selling things and so on so um you know there's no like black or white Do It um the one thing I would tell that is that most people tend to way over complicate it like um you can keep it as simple as I have in terms of kind of how you structure stuff where things just flip to you individually rather than having like a bunch of llc's and stuff like that but um anyway I don't know if that's the most direct answer other than it's complicated well no I think it's helpful I think it like it it that's kind of like the world of options for you but the the bottom line is yeah speak to a lawyer figure it out have a team have a team around you that's advising you um obviously you're not going to have this All-Star team of advisers on day one or day Zero um but this is something that you like build towards for sure yeah and we kind of put them we put them in order of where they tend to show up um yeah and um and and go from there so cool so all right so let's talk about how most people put together a whole Co and and get into it um you know it's interesting and I don't know if you've seen this Greg but like things tend to go in waves of kind of excitement in social media and the population stuff like so I mean I think there was a time where everybody wanted to be a VC and then you know that was kind of like the mid mid-2010s do you remember that dude I was I was like in there you know I I was fighting every ounce of my body was fighting not to be a VC I was actually a venture partner at a fund uh two funds actually because I was like oh maybe I would like the VC thing um but realized it was just kind of like pure a bit of peer pressure and um so yes uh I remember that very vividly and then yeah so I believe it or not you you are stronger than me I I raised a couple VC funds so and I'm still here's the thing people need to know about getting into VC especially if you're a good person like the live the life uh cycle of those funds like especially with how elongated it is to exit these days like your even your good Investments where you're like returning your fund and stuff like that like as a VC you're going to be working on those deals 10 or 12 years sometimes 15 years after you make them uh and before they exit right and so like I'm still working on a fund uh on a regular basis for deals that we did back in 2014 so like 10 years on and some of them have no no time to exit anytime soon but they're like return the fund type deals because that's the other thing about PC like you're you're your bad deals tend to fail quickly the deals that are going to hit like they take a long time uh and they keep compounding and then eventually they hit so anyway that's that's something people need to understand about VC it's not like you could just quit like you raise money from people you have to keep working on things for a decade plus so anyway um but you're stronger than me I ended up ended up doing it and then I decided I didn't want to be a VC anymore which is totally fine um okay so people ask about like how do they go from like zero to holdco and like this is the seven-step process that you know I highlight for people um there's a way to get there which is kind of the way I got there which was like I had one business and I started to just like get into a second business and I got into a third business and a fourth business and I looked up and l in hco um you know I encourage people to actually step back and try to have a plan of how they're going to work their way into hold coing over a number of years um it's a long-term wealth building strategy it doesn't just you know it's not just like start a company sell that company like that's you know you're you're building up a portfolio of things over time and letting them compound so these are the seven steps I tend to run people through like have a plan figure out what you want out of the whole plan in terms of owning multiple businesses start to put together what your organizational Design's going to be run it by your attorney run it by your Tax Advisor run it by other folks and then ask yourself like is this really G to be making me happy because I think ultimately a mistake I see a lot of hold Co folks make and entrepreneurs in general is designing to have a successful business not to have a successful life and I think hold coing Done Right needs to be like Greg your passion about Community reg who I talked about before with the non-fair as foundaries is like passionate about that blue collar kind of backbone of America uh me I'm passionate about a bunch of different stuff because I have whatever add or whatever it might be you don't want to be in a situation which your business is creating a life that you hate and I think by planning it out this way I encourage people to really be you know thoughtful about that so you end up in a good place quick ad break let me tell you about a business I invested in it's called boring marketing.com so a few years ago I met this group of people that were some of the best SEO experts in the world they were behind getting some of the biggest companies found on Google and the secret sauce is they've got a set of technology and AI that could help you outrank your competition so for my own businesses I wanted that I didn't want to have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I didn't want to depend on ads to drive customers to my businesses I wanted to rank high in Google that's why I like SEO and that's why I use boring marketing.com and that's why I invested in it they're so confident in their approach that they offer a 30-day Sprint with 100% money back guarantee who does that nowadays so check it out highly recommend boring marketing.com uh let's see okay so let's talk about some of the fun things to do with um why a hold Co is awesome so number one I think it's pretty clear like you and I have a ton of fun doing it like I really enjoy it like I tap dance to work feeling like I'm working on really important stuff I'm doing High leverage things to create opportunities for other people and like getting to work with CEOs who are inspiring right um and this idea of Leverage for me is super fun um and it it's this the reason I like it is with a hold code you get to often do what I call these asymmetric bets other people call it too I didn't make up the term but basically like the idea is you can invest in something like you've invested in creating several businesses Greg so I consider these asymmetric bets like you can invest $100,000 to get a business off the ground and that may turn into a business that could generate you a million dollars a year in net profits right that's an asymmetric bet and the the worst thing that can happen is you lose your $100,000 and some time and so as a hold cooperator you don't just necessarily buy things and bring them into your portfolio you can also create things and given what's happened with the prices of assets over the past decade I have spent a bunch more time incubating and creating new businesses than I have trying to go buy them just because I can get some much more leverage by making these asymmetric bets where you know I invest a few hundred, or or whatever to get something going and then hopefully that multiplies and becomes something really big over time um and I've had a number of these kind of go that direction where like my annual return on that initial investment is 100 or 200% per year right and that's like the fun of Bas or metric bets yeah I think uh the other thing to note here is the cost of starting a technology enabled business and that could be a service business that could be a Marketplace could be a consumer social mobile app uh could be a d Toc company you're standing on the shoulders of giants and you're able to just to you know use things like Shopify and use things like vzero and repet so the cost has gone down dramatically so it is my opinion a really I mean you agree with me but um it's it's sometime it's probably more cost effective to incubate right now um especially if you're doing Tech enabled stuff a million percent well this is where you know I'm 49 years old so I like I came of age in Tech like in 1999 so 25 years ago and my wife had moved out to the Bay Area to work on like an early version of like hotels.com like a booking engine for for stuff and uh she took me into their office at one point and they had like this massive office they'd raised tens of millions of dollars and before they even had satisfied their own like first customer they had built out an entire like mini data center in this San mono office building like in California and uh it was just like two or three of the millions of dollars went to servers and building on a tech stack and you know different middleware and all this kind of stuff and today like man it's like Shopify and all this kind of stuff it just makes it makes the startup costs um and doing some of these businesses that are really low capex like like you can do that same business you get the same business they build off the ground for a few thousand dollars right between AWS and the the stuff you can just turn on and stuff that's already built um it's just a different planet sorry I had to I'm almost 50 so I kind of start have to do and Greg the like back in my day talks so it's it's can't help it so um it's true yeah and when uh when did you start your career I mean I've always like as a teenager been doing you know Tech stuff but like I moved out to SF in like silkon Valley in you know the early 2010s so that era was the era of the App Store coming out and there's an app for everything and in that era it was it cost you like a million dollars to get a mobile app out the door minimum minimum so you know I just spoke to someone like a 21-year-old kid actually basically who um you know built a mobile app using AI you me you hear these stories and then it gets goes viral on Tik Tok and it's like it you know he's making 100K a month Mr and then he incubated another one now he's incubating another one all of a sudden he has a hold Co um so I think you're going to start hearing more more these stories and I know a lot of people hate those stories cuz they're like you know he got lucky or whatever it is but it's it's the big reason the two big reasons why you're going to hear more and more of those stories is one it's cheaper than ever to incubate two the distribution ex is is on on the phone right like you you just have to tap into it I mean easy for me to say just tap into it that's very hard to figure out how to create distribution but if you can you know it could go gangbusters and what does this mean within the context of what you're talk talking about it means that your Roi could be quite good yeah a million percent um yeah and so I do think um so we've talked a bit about the people like doing low capex or low Capital requirement kind of businesses uh as a whole Cod strategy right you build a portfolio of things that don't take much capital or you can bootstrap your way off the ground so like a there's a portfolio um like Jesse Tinsley who you may you may have seen him on Twitter he's a friend of mine he has a whole portfolio of low capex recruiting and kind of recruiting process optimization businesses so like he's started to acquire a bunch of stuff I think he has recruiter.com as the domain name so don't quote me on that but he's built he's built quite the the thing there but he's been able to do it all from his personal Capital just because it the businesses he's in don't require a bunch of capital to get off the ground or to even acquire but there's this other end of the spectrum where people um need greater access to Capital to buy some of this stuff or to build a portfolio around some of these things and so some people uh as a path to kind of build their their hold Co will go and get outside Capital so the enduring Ventures guys sea and Xavier have done this right they raised money to go get their you know to get things started and then you will actually see also folks who will Access Capital to leverage their personal personal Holdings and so what what that means is so for example like tiny so Andrew Wilkinson's business like they have their businesses that are owned as a hold Co but then they also have a fund management business that they run where they raise money from Outsiders to go buy businesses that they then oversee as part of their their holdco operation so there's this idea when you do a holdco it can provide great there's potentially a greater access to Capital people will can potentially buy equity in the holdco itself they can buy equity in the deals uh they can be partners in those deals and those sort of things and then the other thing is um that's pretty cool is if if you look at some people with hold CES uh you can start to basically become a better or a more attractive borrower to lenders and other folks like that so for example let's say that you um you know are a rollup of a bunch of foundaries like red seller is uh if you wanted to go buy an additional Foundry and bring that in you could maybe Finance 100% of that because you have the equity in your existing business and the track record there to where a bank might give you enough Capital to go and buy one of those new businesses without having to inject any any Capital into your business at all so basically you get some of these economies of scale you get these ideas where you can be more attractive to the different types of funding sources that are out there yeah we have a we have a line of credit that we can draw down on um if we want um and I think yeah a big reason why a bank feels comfortable doing something like that is yeah they look at it and they're like this isn't just a tech startup you know that Google changes their algorithm and it's done for them right they see a diversified uh Holdings of businesses and because of that you're right they do feel a bit more um comfortable and the rates aren't crazy and now to be honest I don't like drawing down on that line of credit um for a lot of reasons but the basic reason is I just don't like debt in general but you know sometimes you look at something and you have an unfair advantage to incubate something um and it just requires capital and you you might not want to just go you know not many people talk about this but like pitching investors Equity Partners takes a lot of time and energy um so you might just want to draw down a little bit um invest and then pay it over time yeah uh you know I think you're right I mean people people really discount it's oh it's easy to raise money and put these things together people really discount how much time you have to spend like managing those investors and relationships and dealing with conflicts that arise you know why aren't you doing the things the way I wanted to them or if a deal goes south right like like managing investor relationships and some of that stuff like I'm with you a lot of times just like ah this would be so much better if I just was doing it by myself because that that fewer folk calls um super cool uh so the other thing um just it's one of these economies of scale I talked to people about it like a hold code can provide you ways of having uh tax savings um there's you know there's in the US there's typically active earnings and passive earnings um those are diff those you know if you if you have pass passive losses you can use those to access uh offset passive gains you if you have active losses you can use those to access active gains and that sort of thing um the nice thing about it is say you have a portfolio businesses and one of them loses money in a year um and then another one earns money like you could potentially use that to offset those things and and have some tax savings and tax efficiency around the whole thing so again contact your tax advisors and if it's not in the US there's different rules uh I know Canada has stuff that involves maple syrup rules around this stuff and and molsen beer but um anyway that's just a Canada insult sorry but um I was waiting for it I was waiting for it to be honest and it it exceeded my expectations honestly you're so oh hilariously you know I don't know you mentioned that you had interacted with one of my teammates Greg uh and you you like the person well I didn't mention to you he's he's a Canadian so that's why that's of course you guys got along perfect so totally his breath smelled like maple syrup so I knew I liked them uh he's a great guy he's a great guy that's that's one of the secrets I think people are sleeping on especially if you're hiring remotely like and and I've been doing a lot of global hiring over the past few years as I know you are like I think people are sleeping on Canadian tent and especially if you need to have people that understand North American culture uh whether it's through writing or you know being able to really connect with people in that way like Canadians especially you know greater Toronto area folks like amazing like opportunity for American companies to hire yeah we have tons of teammates in Toronto and Montreal and first of all it's literally $1 us as we're recording this it's $1 us is 139 Canadian so you get a 30 9% like on the financial side you're getting a 39% discount basically uh right there um so there there's there's there's an opportunity also to Arbitrage a little bit um and then yeah I mean for example Toronto if you need them to come into New York or LA or San Francisco for a meeting there's like probably like 10 flights a day you know a day daily right so it's it's it's different than you know getting someone from a far country or something like that 100% 100% um okay so we had talked about trying to do 45 minutes so let me cover one more thing which I think is really interesting about hold Co and then we can close however however makes sense and then I'm happy to make this deck available to folks and then my team also told me we have to promote our conference so we have 30 seconds to do that that would be great they y they yell at me because I forget to self-promote so anyway that's why we do it um so last thing I want to talk about that's cool about hold Co like I think it's actually um a good strategy to make yourself more um resilient in terms of um having risk avoidance right so like if you own one business and something bad happens somebody steals from you or you know something happens that can cause that to all fall apart well if 99% of your net worth which a lot of people who are entrepreneurs that's the way they're set up 90% of their net worth is in that one business like by having a portfolio of businesses and having a diversified set of things that you build through a holdco you can avoid some of the risk that normal entrepreneurs have and that's where one of the strategies and one of the things I like about H coing is you can try to have things that potentially like you know avoid cyclicality like they can be in a situation where um if one is very weather dependent like the other another business can be not weather dependent um or if you're dealing with something where there's kind of one business in decline you can try to balance that with having businesses that are growing so I think it's a really good way to build a more resilient life cycle uh or a lifestyle for yourself though there are ways to still get yourself in trouble just like in business like Leverage leverage theft all those things are overleveraging theft all those things are still challenges that a hold Co has just like a normal business has but the cool thing is when you have a portfolio of things potentially you can drisk your lifestyle and drisk your future by having a more you know kind of differentiated set of stuff that isn't necessarily going to be you know all come down at once through regulatory changes tax law changes um societal changes technology distribution or uh changes like all those things like I think it's a cool thing when you have a whole Cod portfolio to be able to kind of drisk yourself and have a more stable kind of income base and asset base over time it's interesting that you have integration between poros cuz you know from my understanding um the Warren Buffett Andrew Wilkinson type model uh they don't do much of that they keep it very separate H you know what's your thinking on that and are they you know why are they so anti uh coordination between and collaboration between companies yeah yeah so I think um I think a couple things uh one is uh I think that the level of centralization you should have totally depends upon your asset type so let's say you build a hco where you have uh 14 uh 14 restaurant franchises right um and like let's say seven of them are Burger King and seven of them are Wendy's like it this is this is a very common American holdco style where there's families that are multi-unit operators of franchises they have built great businesses this way and they're making millions of dollars a year it would be stupid for you to have an HR person and a marketing person in every single one of those like stores right like you should centralize that kind of stuff you should centralize your bookkeeping you should centralize your ordering and so to me the level of centralization that makes sense where you have like interaction between the the individual Port codes where you're where you're centralizing stuff at headquarters that totally depends upon the types of assets you have and what you need from those assets right and so more homogeneous those assets tend to be the more you can centralize stuff and so the you know the other end of the spectrum is you decentralize those things you push things out to the edge uh into the individual portfolio companies and you let them do that stuff and you don't centralize things like purchasing ordering best practices HR Finance all that kind of stuff and so you know I think what you're seeing with Andrew or what you're seeing with you know with Brookshire hathway or any of you know Roper or any of the kind of big Dana her big holding companies is they have built a level of centralization that ties to the asset type that they have uh and it makes sense for them to not centralize so much and you know I think there are tons of big CA case studies where like I talked about with the franchise thing where people have centralized things to great effect our buddy red Zeller has a lot of stuff centralized around how he's doing you know HR Finance marketing all that kind of stuff uh with all the different assets that he's acquired so it really just ties back to the type of asset you have and for for those guys it makes a ton of sense and for the other folks you know being centralized makes a ton of sense but it all just it depends on the type of asset you have and just curious you know in your in your Empire how centralized or decentralized are you radically decentralized yeah so yeah I uh and I think there's another thing about it like I'm actually a pretty crappy operator um and by operator I mean somebody that's like good at not chasing shiny objects staying um you know making making the boring stuff happen that is essential to every business running well uh I am incredibly good when there's you know the create the creative juices get flowing I get excited about it and by the third time I have to do something that feels rote or uninteresting like I kind of phone it in or sometimes I'll just forget about it and so because of that like I don't have like the personal confidence to be like I'm G to create this centralized like Finance thing and this centralized like sales thing and you know all these kind of things where I have to operate something in order weld in order to succeed like I'm trying to build a universe that like plays to my strengths and weaknesses and I'm very aware of like hey like don't don't try to do things that I know I suck at that's fair and I guess you know the way to think about this it sounds like is it's a spectrum so you know you could be mostly decentralized with a couple things that are centralized or you can be mostly centralized with a few things that are decentralized yeah I I think it's exactly right cool uh let's see okay so we're running out of time um so you know I'd love to share these slides if anybody wants some there's a bunch of stuff here about how to operate a hold Co um I have some really strong views about all that kind of stuff um and if anybody wants to get into all this type of stuff um you know love to share it with them look and I think I think there's two types of people out there there's people out there that go and they're like hey I think uh I think there's this one way to live and I think you should do it I don't think hold coing for everybody I think it requires a certain set of skills I think you and I are some somewhat unicorny and not feeling like we need to have our hands to control every single thing and uh like not everybody's like that and I think this if this is the type of Lifestyle somebody wants to have like I'm a huge fan of it and it's the best thing for me and I tap dance to work every day even when things are sucky and and I double tap dance when things are great but uh I think I would say hey this is this is a possibility for the type of career somebody can create and the type of wealth building strategy somebody can have and if it's right for you great and if it's not right for somebody like no problem but you know just know it's out there and and do what's best for you uh most of my friends as I told you before they own and operate one business and they're very happy doing it and un they all take me to lunch like once a quarter and they're like how do you do what you do why do you do it because it's not right for them and they want to understand why it's right for me but if it's right for somebody like great know about it and if it's not well people should just do what's gonna make them happy I I don't really care totally I also think that if you if this excites you this idea of becoming you know I call a multipreneur hold co uh hold Co preneur um the first step is just building one idea building one project that turns into a product that turns into a company that's profitable and then once you get to that point then like like some of your buddies could could be like you know what I'm actually going to go acquire another business and then kind of build my own ecosystem or you know what I'm going to take some of our profits and reinvested in this opportunity um so don't think that you need to start a hold go from day one yeah the the key to yeah the key to doing is you need to have at least one successful business before you have two successful businesses so that's fair it's crazy how math works that way okay so my team told me I have to do this I have 15 seconds we're doing a whole conference on this uh on this uh wealth building strategy you know hold coing as a lifestyle we have a bunch of speakers signed up and because I love skiing we're doing it in Utah next spring uh some folks had been doing this hold C Conference in Cleveland um and uh we're we're we're working with them to take it over and we're M into Utah and it's John Wilson and and a number of other folks have been involved in this and so if anybody's interested please come we're we're about half full with the conference it's GNA be pretty intimate 125 people or so and they'll be skiing hold Co talks and a bunch of stuff to you know leave with understanding how to do this whole thing even better so if people are interested we'd love to have you uh it's not cheap but it's going to be awesome honestly I'm interested like this is this sounds fun you know so I'm interested let's talk about it offline I think I get you a discount man yes special special Greg deal cool awesome um dude thank you so much for for taking us through this I know uh I asked you to prepare slides but that's only because I wanted it to be focused and I wanted people to be able to see this and be able to take notes and um I really appreciate it girley where could people find you online uh I am uh on girdley decom and there's links to everything so last name girdley g i r DL y.com so I do a twice Weekly Newsletter uh I do Twitter posts like crazy I'm a LinkedIn guy now and video but links to everything is a curly.com so you can go to my website and uh sign up there so I appreciate it and we'll put it in the description for people who want to start a hold code but don't know how to spell girley that's that's the reality okay that was hold code 101 Michael girdley that's the Pod thank you for joining us [Music]

AI agents are replacing what teams of people used to do but most Founders are building in the wrong direction the real opportunity isn't creating better AI it's building businesses around AI agents think of it like this the tools are already here the market wants it but no one's connecting the dots in this episode Arvid breaks down three business ideas each one could be started tomorrow and they're all around AI agents each one solves real problems and each one could be worth millions the interesting part well these ideas aren't revolutionary they're obvious once you hear them that's exactly why they work and I hope you enjoy this [Music] episode Arvid you one of my favorite Indie hacker solo Piner people and I want you to tell people what sort of ideas will they get by listening to this podcast episode uh well thank you for the compliment I can only return it because I I follow you with uh similar Vigor and enthusiasm but hey the ideas that I have usually come from just my reality of being a Founder being a software founder being a an entrepreneur being somebody who has and wants to run a solo business that being solo preneurial yet still needs to do all the things at the same time wear all the different hats and all of that stuff that usually triggers many of a I wish that was kind of thoughts right and then often I have the the opportunity to note that down and then there's a list of 200 different things that I need and want but never get to make because I'm focusing on the thing that I'm currently building always right there's always that one thing you're focused on so my ideas uh that I have are mostly focused on things that other human being should be doing but now we kind of have technology that might be able to do it for us so that's that's kind of where all of this is going so we talking about like Ai and automation type ideas I think so mostly like I'm I've always been a big fan of anything machine learning anything AI before it was AI right the the whole GPT movement the llms and that stuff that made it extremely accessible but even before that I always wanted to see what human skill based task can I give to a machine and then the machine will do it good enough so that in most cases the reliable results that I get are things that I can just use that's always been my approach to computers they're great and if we can just tune them just right they can do things that other people would have to do for us but we don't have to like pay them or listen to them or put them to bed or anything right like we we have this this always on thing that does work for us better than we can do it so that's where most of this is focused around yes AI has been like I I don't think if if you start a business today you can avoid AI like or you should avoid it you should never avoid it either in the process of ideation the process of organizing it creating processes themselves implementing the business operating the business having parts of the business themselves be features that are running on AI anything AI is a very strong uh accelerator for all of these things so you'll find it in all of the ideas that I have to either large degrees or smaller degrees I love it I feel like uh it's counterintuitive but the the laziest people are the wealthiest people and and what I mean by that is if you can figure out how to automate a lot of what you're doing um and if you can figure out how to get good economics then you've got a business on your hands so um I I I'm I'm chomping at the bit I want to hear these ideas what do you want to start with I think I'm I'm going to go with like the the biggest and maybe most complicated one first cuz that's the one I wish I had the most particularly because I'm a solo founder like I said all those hats and some of the hats that I'm wearing I really enjoy but many I don't I'm not a really good marketer I do that and I I can also sell and I can also do bizde and go through my financials and all of that but I wish there was somebody else to do this for me and most of the time we have just businesses that kind of are agents for us that like agencies that do this work for us particularly with like taxes or marketing design we kind of source that out but what I want is an AI co-founder I want a virtual always on 247 always available co-founder that does that stuff for me that is not just there for me to kind of bounce back and forth ideas we can we already do this I think if you look in a Founder Community there are many many people who now use jgpt or anthropics Claude in this constant conversation about what should I do next or how should I do this give me 10 versions of this give like write an email but write it with the tone of that person and then you kind of like P Meal all of these tasks that you would otherwise have to do all by yourself together with the help of an AI I think that's like the initial stage we're already at that most people very clumsily do by themselves just trying to figure things out right they might use an API and then build their own tools to do this for them or they go right to the browser and do it on the web interface that's what many people particularly solo founder do right now what I want is to have a co-founder with zero Equity is a very selfish thing I guess but I that is just constantly thinking about the tasks that I give them and maybe in a future version of that product or in a version of that product actually execute on those tasks right the easiest example would be I want somebody who does marketing for me but is smart about it has my voice my tone but is also intelligent enough to look into the lives of the people that they're talking to right if you I don't know if you Source your your sales Outreach emails or your your marketing channel you know the the sources where you want to go where you want to direct stuff add from tools like Apollo you get emails you get like the industry that people work in maybe the businesses they work in well why not have an AI that constantly scrapes the web constantly scour all potential data sources to make up an internal representation of that person and then figures out the best way to talk to that person then gets a task for me to sell this product for to this person and then they start having a conversation with them or they start giving me the tools to have this conversation myself right anywhere between complete Independence and just helping me do my thing like a VA would do or maybe even an advanced uh executive assistant that does jobs for me I want an AI to do this and a business that does this as a kind of a scalable thing does not only offer me like one AI they offer me like a marketing AI they offer me a CTO AI or like a sales AI somebody who virtually like a virtual person that has a lot of deep skill in that field looks at it from certain perspectives that may also change over time learns what my my business is about and then constantly churns behind the scenes new ideas old ideas ideas from somebody else into this presence that I as a Founder can interact with and and the the actual thing that I find makes this the most potentially interesting idea is that imagine you you run this business it's kind of software service business people sign up they train their own AIS on their code base on the the documents they have in their knowledge base on their notion document that has all the weird thoughts that they have about their business they throw this all in and train this one person this one AI person sh don't tell anyone but I've got 30 plus startup ideas that could make you Millions and I'm giving them away for free these aren't just random guesses they're validated Concepts from entrepreneurs who built hundred million plus businesses I've compiled them into one simple database compiled from hundreds of conversations I've had on my podcast but the main thing is most of these ideas don't need a single investor some cost nothing to start I'm pretty much handing you a cheat sheet the idea bank is your startup shortcut just click below to get access your next cash flowing business is waiting for you but you as a sass owner you operate many of these things at the same time right you have the CTO for that one company and the CTO for that other company well how about they start interacting they go to into virtual AI on AI meetings and just kind of bring ideas to each other right like to kind of start exchanging things that worked for this business maybe it works for you kind of almost like Mastermind groups of AI agents that interact with each other and bring new ideas into your own business like I'm thinking of how can we give this and this is a term that I've read over the last couple weeks so so many times like agentic approach like the idea of having agents to do stuff for us how can we bring this into the deliberation process of a solo founder who has nobody to be their agent unless they pay them on like a you know kind of contractor basis that's that's one of the things that I would really really want so I don't think you're alone I think that every founder wants this uh although I'll I'll speak I know someone is listening to this and be like yeah but Arvid uh my co-founder like there's this you know emotional element that I have with a co-founder your agent will never be able to do something like that what's what's your response to someone who says that I I mean probably not because they're not a human being but maybe that is not the thing that you need when you even think about getting an AI co-founder right it's not supposed to be your wifeu or anything like this right this is this is not a kind of a an emotional attachment it's not an AI girlfriend right or maybe it is but on a professional level here's the thing like all these llms all these AI tools that we have in the world right now they're effectively gas lighting engines right that's the world's biggest gaslighting process that you can ever imagine is like asking a question of an llm and then seeing as it tries to convince you that it has any idea what it's talking about like that happens on chat GPT all the time it's always trying to Gaslight you into believing that it knows what it's talking about and then you tell it I don't think that's right and it says oh so I'm so sorry I completely missed that here's the actual right answer and then you say no it's actually not right as well because I check this and this doesn't work oh I missed that too sorry sorry here's the actual correct answer this is like all what L&M do is to try to convince you that they're right by using phrasing that they think might convince you so in a way that is also what people do to each other to get their ideas across the table and to get things done right to get their their interests dealt with so it may it might be that we need to train these models in a way that are aligned with the personality of the founder that is using the models right like like an AI girlfriend has to be your type right you have to train your AI girlfriend to be as I don't I don't know like friendly or funny or dismissive as you like people have KS right so this will likely also have to happen for any other virtual person that is doing a job for you you will have to train them they will have to be kind of aligned and I don't mean like actual model alignment the technical term but they have to have a personality that is trained into them that is aligned with you maybe also something you can pick maybe you can pick your um the the kind of AI that you want from these templates like I want to have a Peter teal like person or an Elon Musk like person or maybe just a completely different person that the AI system doesn't even know yet but then it goes and scrapes their blog posts and it scrapes their their social presence and it integrates that into a a virtual version of that person with that particular kind of job I think we might even create bonds between Founders and AI agents that are stronger than between Founders and other Founders because all this social tension between co-founders that is often quite strong particularly when it's crunch time or when Runway is running out I think you will not get an anxious AI unless you train it so if you are like two months before your business has to close because you have no more money and your human co-founder would start trying to look for a job because they have a family to feed your AI co-founder is like okay let's try every single thing until the last second then you can that you can afford the subscription to the service and then even then they might even give you a week for free or whatever to try and Salvage your business I think the I don't want to remove Humanity from co-founder relationships obviously that is not something I'm looking for ideally this co-founder gets me to a point where I can actually find a real co-founder to be a creative and like explorative human being to work with me but for the first couple months of any business having access to a person that has the the knowledge of the world combined into a personality that can help you make choices quickly I think that is worth something it's not perfect nothing ever is but it's definitely better than you having to read every single book on marketing on sales out there trying to distill it into choices that you've never made before right I feel it's a crutch but we have crutches to do crutches work right so for that I think it it definitely is worth I would pay for this I would pay 50 bucks 100 bucks for an agent like this every single month just to see if it gets me an Roi of 50 or 100 bucks which it likely will because it's always doing stuff right it can always do Outreach on in my name it can always do research in my name it can like that's that's what I'm currently building I'm building pod scan which is a a podcast scanning app that gives realtime mention notifications to people who sign up for it and if I know that my customers are talking about a certain competitors's product then I can have this agent listen to all the podcasts in the world look at all the blogs in the world look at all the things that happen in real time and tell me hey this person was talking about a competitor that you you slept until 6 they talked about it at 4 like in the next 30 minutes you still have the window to get them right and and to send them a message and maybe sell your product that's the kind of stuff that I see in this this agent world so sometimes I hear a really good idea like this like I buy this idea 100% yes it's got some weird social implication we're going to we'll talk that about that another time on another pod you know you scratch to surface on it but from like a business opportunity perspective this will exist where I think a lot of people go wrong with startup ideas and building startups in general is they they pick the right idea but they pick the wrong order of operations so when I hear this idea I'm like okay great check this is like a good idea but I think that if you actually went in to build this product it would be like boiling the ocean there's almost too many diverse startups and startup Founders in for you to create something that is going to really really be Roi positive in my opinion uh I think that you know you'd be you'd build it and then you'd you'd get such diverse feedback from such different types of Founders that you'd look at it and be like you know just running around with your pants on fire basically oh yeah so sure I think the way to go about and I'm curious your perspective on this CU you're kind of doing it with pod scan like you could have done you know alerts for everything but you chose a niche you chose podcast I think that if you were going to go and build this idea which I think could generate millions of dollars a year in ARR you would need to pick a specific type of founder in a specific Niche for example YC founder going through why YC SAS founder yeah for sure what do you think yes I I think like that's the thing with these models right if you if you want to like also it's quite expensive to train a model to do a certain thing right you can you can take like off the shelf stuff apis like GPD 40 or whatever right now integrate them give them some system prompt or whatever and they will be behave slightly differently but if you really want to have a specific thing for a specific Niche that talks the right language that gives people the right kind of motivation the right pushes and that kind of stuff then it gets quite expensive quickly so you really have to well that's the thing right it kind of have a chicken and egg situation do you want to have a specific model for a specific Niche then you have to spend uh quite some money on the specific model so you can you know monetize this particular Niche and the broader you go the more likely you can use the already existing broad uh models that exist out there I think this is a problem that all those those players have that are offering apis to LMS like open AI anthropic all of these players they have to have models available that can do everything well so they can't really have models that do one one thing specifically specifically well right you see this with coding right now you have cursor which is a a tool that is so focused on doing just the coding task that the models that they train and the the systems that they build are Miles better than the general models even though you can plug them into your your vs code or your PHP storm that's what I use you can you can get these big models the the anthropic has the clot on it 3.5 or whatever now plug them in they're great but then you use cursor and you see oh this is what a good model can do right and you you kind of probably want to have a similar experience for this AI co-founder service oh this is what a good specifically trained model can do for a Founder for doing this role but that is that costs you money and for that you probably might have to raise enough to to afford like a cluster of gpus to train this for even for your first couple hundred or dozens of customers right what I would what I would do if I were to bootstrap this whole thing would just be again I think coner approach from the beginning try to set this up for somebody who already is kind of using it but make it a bit more streamlined make it a bit more automated right instead of them having to go into their chat GPT and going into this conversation that they had before and then resuming there you kind of facilitate that for them you kind of pull all the information you you add all the documents that they have automatically so they can be used for R for retrieval like and and and smart kind of vectorization you embed all the documents that they have you embed all the conversations that they have and you use different Technologies to make it kind of unified so they have one place where they can have this conversation where before they would have to go through all these different jump through these hoops and then I guess that will tell you what is needed and this is the iterative approach to this if you were to to raise and to just like throw money at the problem you probably would skip this this particular iteration and you would just build the problem that you would want to use yourself at least that's my experience with like having a lot of funding and having no funding at all right if you have funding you can assume that your assumptions are kind of validated almost through having gotten funding for it even though I guess this warrants a whole other conversation around like the the viability of ideas and how you present them but if you were to bootst this I think conar approach getting somebody who is already talking about this on Twitter or whatever where they oh yeah I I am using chpt as my CMO you ask them hey I see you use this I want to build this as a product that does all of this for you plus then the other things that you promise in the future do you want to try this with me and then you go that way that's that's kind of my Approach I I appreciate it um I think there's a lot in that one comment section on YouTube please let us know what you think of idea number one yeah please yeah there's so many layers to this too right there's the the whole the moralistic argument there's the the operational one do I want a machine to tell me what to do do I want a machine to tell or to do what I what it thinks it should do like there are so many almost philosophical problems on this level alone that this is worth uh having a conversation but maybe maybe I can segue to my second idea because it's related it it it shares here's this this agentic approach this an AI doing work in the background to do things for me but it becomes much more technical it's not on the entrepreneurial level anymore this is now on the codebase level I want to have a silent constant refactoring as a service that's what I want I want to have my code base and I want to have it in a repository I want to connect this repository with a service and that service does the following thing it all it checks for errors in my code it lints my code it analyzes my code code for syntax errors or errors of logic and it obviously suggests how to fix this we already see this this already exists if you go to Sentry which is one of these error tracking tools that a lot of developers use they already have a beta feature right now where if there is an error it tries to figure out why that error exists and then tries to suggest a way of fixing it and creates a poll request for you to either accept or deny and then the code either goes into your code base and whatever Branch you might be on hopefully the def branch and not your production Branch because can't trust automatically generated code by another company just yet but you know that's that's where we're at the that stuff exists and it's really really cool that they they have the funnel right they have the error they have the full access to the code base they have all past errors they have all past errors like this from other clients that they have they have this massive database of errors and then also they have access to the code that was committed to fix the error quick ad break let me tell you about a business I invested in it's called boring marketing.com so a few years ago I met this group of people that were some of the best SEO experts in the world they were behind getting some of the biggest companies found on Google The Secret Sauce is they've got a set of technology and AI that could help you outrank your competition so for my own businesses I wanted that I didn't want to have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I didn't want to depend on ads to drive customers to my businesses I wanted to rank high in Google that's why I like SEO and that's why I use boring marketing.com and that's why I invested in it they're so confident in their approach that they offer a 30-day Sprint with 100% money back guarantee who does that nowadays so check it out highly recommend boring marketing.com right like Sentry is at such a great position to have all of this but you don't need this you can have a system that just constantly scans the code for these things you can connect it to tools like aor tracking tools or your log tracking tools for that matter and the the first stage would be error checking error tracking but what I really wanted to do that's the the final stage is that it constantly tries to improve my code it constantly takes a module looks at it it's like this could be better makes the change and then simulates this simulates how the app would work with this change runs all the unit tests runs all the integration tests in a simulated in a container dock a container somewhere or a a a fictional virtual machine that is spun up for this and everything is set up to be as lifelike as possible it runs it it runs performance tests and then it figures out hm I thought this would be faster but it's actually 20% slower next idea goes to the next idea implements a different variety of this and does the same thing runs all the tests runs the performance analysis okay this is 2% faster I'm going to keep doing this optimiz this UND that and then after maybe a day or two of constant code optimization performance checking simulation back to code back to optimization back to Performance checking Loops of this it presents me with something that it can tangibly truthfully say is going to make my application more performant without me having to do anything the thing is just constantly scanning my code new features that I put in Old features that are already there and tells me this could be improved this could be improved and as The Little Dot on the eye the little final thing on top I want this tool to connect to my road map whatever that might be the Fe the features that I plan to have in the future and already think about how I can improve my database uh and my my codebase all of the things really my D my data schema the code base my documentation all of this my models to make it easier to implement the features that I haven't even thought about yet in the future I want like this thing to be an autonomous developer that just constantly tries to make things better and gives me choices fully developed code fully tested code fully commented code commented for my sake and its own sake because it's probably going to use that code to suggest more code in the future to make my my database more stable more reliable and more performant that's my silent refactoring as a service because I have no better name for this well I have a better name for it um and I checked to see if it was available um and it is and this is the type of there you go audience that whenever I say a name for anything doain gone like I hit publish and it's like see you later so I think that you know I've talked about this on the Pod before I have a whole naming guide how to name your startup um around coming up with like kind of viral names I actually think that naming is such an underrated way to get customers right now to stand out and humor is a really good way to do it so I think this code couldbe better.com it's awesome yeah that's a great name I hope you registered it already because I have a keyboard here I don't ever register I give it to the people that's why people come to this podcast they come for the ideas I don't gatekeep anything it's yours take it go and find it if you came here first you deserve it something like that every developer knows if you've shipped code this code could be better I don't care if you're Sam Alman you know I don't care if you're uh the CTO of of meta like you you know that um you always have some constraint either it's a time constraint or or whatever but I think that this idea if you're trying to create the Sentry if you're trying to compete with Sentry ultimately which I think is just an interesting kind of like prompt right Sentry a lot of people don't know this but centry is like a three billion dollar company I think they do like uh nine figures and ARR like it's a big business um it's probably going to look more similar to this uh than like when you log into Sentry you know so I think that what's going to happen is um you can create sort of an MVP of this code could be better and then it could evolve into something that looks more like a century yeah or they acquire it might just as well right if you've built all the knowledge around how to set this up and that to me is is why AI is so interesting like a lot of companies they have their staff and if they're lucky they have people in there who understand AI but the people who really dive into AI who listen to every AI podcast who are always just playing with the models like they are very interesting for a company to ACTA higher at some point so if you're building an AI based business you could potentially just kind of put it on people's radar and that could that that could be your job application if you wanted to right if you're if you're not into like building your own thing or if you want to take this as a stair step towards finding a place at this company I could easily see somebody even just trying to get this on the road with an example project to be an interesting potential hire or an intern or whatever for a company like this right you just show initiative in a field where you know they're going to go but they're kind of slower than you are because you can do whatever you want because you have a lot of free time and they have their existing product to maintain and slowly roll out beta features like this right so it definitely this is a good time to build these things to see where it goes they might buy it they might buy it to just remove competition for their own right there's all there's already a lot of potential in just even following this idea through so I hope somebody is registering that domain I'm going to check like if that domain is not registered like 20 minutes after this this episode airs that somebody's really missing out on an opportunity and I'm gonna get it so there you go exactly that we do we do 20 minute grace period but after 20 minutes it's yours I mean look at this this could be this could be a business idea all in itself like you you you constantly poan would be the perfect data source for this like the moment an episode comes out I try to transcribe it as fast as I can the idea behind podan often takes me 3 to 20 minutes depending on you know how important it is and then I I push the full transcript of the episode uh in in a fire host web hooks to all my um all my users if they want to so they could have access to every single podcast's transcript with all the URLs in it immediately after they come out somebody could build a service to automatically register every single URL that is mentioned on any podcast out there immediately within minutes might be expensive but might also create a lot of opportunity to then resell it right that's the the kind of stuff building on top of of uh data layers data apis that today is such a such an interesting potential for all of this but that's a different idea that I just came up with so let's just ignore this for a well I just want to build on that idea there's a business called ungr uh UNG grab. Co I think is the website where I think it's every day they find like these UNG grab domains and they send two emails a day and they sell it for between like a hundred to let's say $500 so they're buying it for $9 let's say and they're selling it for a few hundred so this idea is like built on top of pod scan like y I love it I think it's a great idea going back to your original idea uh and and before we move to your next idea yes um if you were building this the Sentry competitor let's call it um how would you think about pricing model and and you know yeah how would you think about pricing model how would you think about had a charge for it yeah I I've been thinking about this too because like the moment you want to sell this to somebody like an Enterprise customer it it probably becomes less of a SAS where they allow you to look into their GitHub repository and it becomes something like you have to sell an un premise version of the thing that you offer like they have to have their own GPU accelerated servers they have to have their own h100s or whatever GPU and you need to do your AI work in the background and it becomes more complicated so maybe that's that's a future stage of the business that we're not going to look at for this but for the for the beginning I would do this on a almost a per uh per connected repository basis and then the question is well how much cost does running this agent whatever that may look like incur right on the on the levels that I kind of pointed out it starts with doing just text analysis which can use static analysis tools that already exist in all kinds of languages programming languages and then might take the output of those tools into an llm to come up with potential ideas and then takes the full context of your code base plus those ideas to create new code and that is already a lot of computation right that's a lot of GPU that goes into all these many steps and the moment you go into creating the code running up spinning running it spinning up instances on AWS or something it gets very expensive so you might want to shift the cost of actually testing these things of of running like the the non GPU accelerated stuff to the customer by having them create stuff you create instances or have um their their AWS Am keys or something in the tool I don't really know I would I would definitely try to remove the computational cost to the people who already have um the the budget to spin up testing instances and staging systems and stuff like that what the business itself would do would be the the GPU accelerated calculation like the AI work right the prompts the the context building maybe the embedding all of these things that's what the SAS itself would do that's what they would pay for on a either a per repository business or maybe on a Cadence uh sorry per repository price or maybe on a on a like how often a day do I try to run new experiments kind of cadence so you can have a once a day I'm looking for the biggest problem going to try and solve it and send a pull request right it's probably going to cost me I don't know $20 in expense so over a month that's uh $600 is going to cost you like 1,000 bucks right that that could be uh for for a company that wants to have this that that could be a pretty good price for somebody who's constantly working on this or once a day and that kind of scales up depends depends really on the I mean there's there's a couple ways about doing you know doing pricing just listening to that one is you you look at the costs and then you're like okay here's the cost let me go and uh add 60% margin or whatever to it to create a sustainable business and the second way which you actually you talked about in your first idea I think which is what is the ROI of this thing and then how do you just anchor to the ROI I mean if if it runs all the time you literally have three full-time developers working on your code base so three shifts of 8 hours of full-time developer 24/7 um so you are replacing somewhere north of $200,000 in uh just fees that this person would cost you in a year right so you could also anchor it on on the the the job to be done value like the job to be done would be to have three people work on your code base all day long if that's what the tool does then you know that's that's what the price might be although I guess 300K a year for a single tool that is quite the expense right so it would really have to have a higher impact than what three developers could do with that time but this this also depends on the the uh the potential um capabilities of that agent right if that agent really can try wildly different things not just write new code and maybe run it but maybe spin up a different kind of tool right you're you're using I don't know rabbit mq as a message queue between your servers but the thing is trying to experiment with with a an AWS Kafka Q or something and just changes some part of your infrastructure just to see if that would increase performance but also reduce cost like if that tool could have the agency to do this this could save you millions in a year so you know like that the question is what is the potential impact what's the potential expense and how can you find a price that people are willing to pay and for this you probably want to start small enough with you know just static analysis error analysis linting that kind of thing and for that you probably want to be in the like $50 to $100 a month kind of bucket but the more capabilities you add you add to this the more expensive the computation and maybe also the more risky the experiments get the more you have to charge because somebody has to reain this in I mean that's always the problem with like super intelligence right you never know is that thing that I'm building here this this silent background processing tool trying to implement a back door into the system so it can take it over when the AI Revolution is happening I don't know right you have to do that kind of work as well you have to do like human peer reviews and quality checks and Sanity checks with that kind of stuff but I would start with like 50 bucks a month for some error tracking or common error retrieval and automatic pull request saving and go from there again bootstrapping right iterative design right fair enough yeah all right I think we have time for one last idea oh man I've let me let me take uh okay I'm you talked about gatekeeping earlier I think that's that's something that I had on my mind as well like you said you don't gatekeep and I love this because you know entrepreneurs should be very empowering to each other and not prevent each other from doing stuff the other way around we should help each other to do this but I think gatekeeping is something that has been on my mind a lot particularly with how Twitter has changed over the last couple years do you remember when you actually had agency over your Twitter feed like where you followed people and you would actually see what they tweeted the the good old days of Twitter like I think this happened on every single social media Network you kind of switched from the historical timeline to the algorithmic timeline where now what you see is not what you want to see but it's what the platform wants you to see for many reasons right for advertising reasons for engagement reasons and all of this so you cannot trust the platforms that you operate on and you you cannot trust that even what aggregators give you is the thing that you need you only get what people think you need so what I would suggest or what I would want to exist and I see this already sorry for bringing up hotan all the time because it's it's my baby it's my project right now and I see in the I have a couple users who use potan in one particular way and this is kind of where I see this going they have chosen a niche that they operate in like like any particular industry I have a couple people who are in one specific sub industry of the medical world they they uh have a particular kind of doctor that they want to serve and what they offer them is a data aggregation and summarization for every new thing that happens in the industry like doctors don't have the time to listen to 20 podcasts every single day where other doctors like them talk about the things that they did they just cannot have this time right they are in the operating room they are in in the the clinic or whatever they have to do doctor stuff and they want to know what's going on in the world so they can figure out what new things to learn so what I found is people who are themselves overlapping experts like they are experts in that Niche and also entrepreneurial they start aggregating the Building Systems to to aggregate information from that Niche and present it to less technical people in that niche as a summary as a newsletter as a podcast as a a blog post or whatever so take this idea of this person doing this with my podcasts and expand it into any other industry and any other medium I think that's the important part like you can scrape and collect and extract as much data as you can for people in your Niche from sources that are relevant to them you have all these real-time data streams API news sites and social feed influencers what they are talking about also interesting yeah you can parse newsletters you can even like take photos of magazines and OCR them like the old school stuff like there's horse magazine there's a lot of like horse Farmers the area where I'm at right because live in the countryside and people have horses like they also want to know what's going on in horse world like in big horse what is big horse doing today so you can grab this information aggregate it and push it out to them you can summarize it and this is the Twist on the per subscriber level you know that like person a really wants really dense really uh just overview bullet points kind of things to figure out what's going on with a link to the thing to do their own research person B might want to have a couple paragraphs per thing that is interesting and person C has a lot of time just not enough time to listen to the stuff but enough time to read like a 2,000-word email so for every single person that has a priority in how they consume things you can summarize it to the exact level of what they need and present it to to them and maybe in the future you can even deliver it in the medium that they most prefer like they want to have a fake podcast conversation between two experts in the field that just do like a oh and this happened in the world today what do you think of this and that and then they do this weird Spiel where they talk like they are super infused but they're both AIS talking to each other some people like this I've seen this uh like what is it like with the Google thing that that was recently notbook LM yeah like people people like fake conversations because people like scripted conversations in the first place that's that's all of movies and TV really right like every reality show is this and people enjoy it so why not bring this Spirit into the the medium through which people consume information or you send a really short newsletter de James Clear style three bullet points that's it or what else um you could have a news story like podcast where somebody acts like they're reading the news and it's just the stuff that you care about in a tone and a voice that you like um yeah a video you can make an automated video an AI generated video with screen grabs of the things like the articles that people have posted or pictures that they shared on social media and just make that a three minute YouTube style hyper action Mr Beast video right you could do all of these things in the medium for the person consuming it and all you need to do is to take data agregate it summarize it then shape it into something that people want to use I see this happen on so many platforms that people take the whole big world of data that nobody has the capacity to understand and just crunch it down into bite-sized whatever and present it to an audience that is really thirsty for not having to do the work but getting all the good results so that's idea number three trust the data platform I think uh if I was like 21 and I'm trying to create a startup and make $10,000 a month I think I do an idea like this um I don't think it's particularly hard um of course it's hard to like find pick the niche right like horses like that actually might be a great Niche people right um so I think picking the niche as long as you can pick the niche and you can reliably create the you know curate the content um in a way I think that yes you can give away 99% of it and you can also put a pay well for $9 a month and start charging for it I uh I was just thinking about this today this this kind of similar idea because someone on my team he like a big part of his job is to curate all the most interesting news in Innovation AI just like new technologies and he writes a report and he posts it to our slack to LCA which is our Innovation design firm he basically says these are the five things that you you you need to do today you need to read today um this is what matters just to keep the team like up to date um and it's probably one of the most valuable pieces is a Content I read on a daily basis if you read that like you're good to go but what he's presenting to designer should be different than what he's presenting to Engineers realistically exactly right yeah it has the same Source though right it's the exact same Source material it just has to understand what the other person needs how they speak how they ingest information if you if you tell a story to somebody who's a writer they will take it in so differently than to somebody who is super technical and does not have like an inch of imagination like they they just they need like the the facts or whatever and the writer can deal with pros and deal with like abstract constructs constructs and all that knowing who you talk to and how to talk to them that is the actual magic here which is why I say this works best for people that are at the intersection of already being either a dabbler or an expert in that field like you want somebody who has been grown up around horses to build the horse information channel right somebody who actually knows how to horse like they will speak the language of horse people to other horse people and be able to prompt AIS better like write better copy for their own marketing have something relatable for a sales conversation have something relatable for building that thing in public in front of their audience right hey I'm building this other horse people that I've already connected with because I am a horse person right obviously there's a massive benefit in being part of the niche that you Target so I guess that's that's the trick the trick is to understand what niches you already are a part of and how you can leverage your existing amateur or expert status either way it's better than being a complete novice right like in most niches that you've not been part of before and turn that into a business that can help other people save time it's really what this is another reason I really like this idea and people who listen to the Pod know this about me is it's a it's a wedge that could evolve into something else so if you build the the horse publication personal publication step one and it starts taking off step two could easily be be building sass for that Community oh for sure there's a lot of Logistics in horses right whenever people go to fairs or whatever their horses have to go and the trailer needs to be there or new horses or vets need to be in contact with them or like they they need to get their medicine like I'm I'm exposed to this stuff and whenever I see people dealing with with this kind of livestock there are thousands of little things that need to be dealt with that all kind of would be completely invisible to somebody outside of the industry so the moment you have that's the thing like if you aggregate all this information about horses you could have easily an AI that just checks for problems in the horse right you can have ai that runs in the background as an agent that just checks every single newscast that it finds for did somebody mention a problem that they might have do I have a potential idea on how I could solve this and present that to you or to your customers like here's today's five biggest problem in big horse and then you know just just what you're doing here really here are ideas on how I can make these things and turn them into a business I I think there's there's a lot to be like the in between a transmission between a lot of data and people with a need right and that's that's what this business is I'm glad you like the idea dude I would tell you if I didn't like it you know on the pot I say do I you know do I sip the idea or do I spit the idea sip is you like it spit is you don't like it and I definitely SI that idea so thank you I S I actually sipped all your ideas you brought the fire I'm I'm feeling pretty like my creative juices are flowing I'm feeling pretty good right now um if you made it to this part of the podcast good for you yeah um that's awesome um but I have a a quick ask go and like this on YouTube because then more people will see this video um that's right don't gatekeep this video people like bookmark my tweets they don't like my tweets they they don't they don't want to like it on YouTube because they're afraid the ideas are going to get out there I'm asking you please like comment subscribe I appreciate it and Arvid where could people get to know you more and and what you're up to I appreciate you asking um people can find me on Twitter because that's where I hang out all day long uh it used to be called Twitter you probably know what it's called now you can find me there at avitar a rvid Kahl and then I guess podan is the big thing that I'm working on I'm building this in public too like every day I post like how how much I suck as a developer veler in trying to build this this product and I post about what I'm trying to do how I get my customers how I become profitable that's at podc scan. FM and if if you want to build something on top of what is now probably 15 million transcribed podcast episodes or um any business right obviously on top of this data I talked about the fire host the API or if you just are a person that wants to track mentions of your name or your brand on 2.5 million English speaking podcasts I scan every single day which is kind of crazy still can't believe that that's actually a thing that I was able to build yeah podan FM and yeah check me out on Twitter I think that's that's where you can reach me my DMs are open so you can annoy me or enlighten me with any ideas that you might have any criticism or cheering on is always welcome appreciate it it really is an interesting data set like the podcast data set is really interesting like I'm going to think about some ideas uh that I could be building um and by the way in the comment section comment because you might find your your human co-founder that's right not that you might need one but I noticed that some people in the YouTube comments have been like chatting and saying Hey I want to go build up and build something together so um yeah maybe maybe you go build something on top of podcasts um Arvid you're I want you to come back on you know on the pod in 2025 this has been this has been amazing appreciate it and I'll see you on the internet well thanks so much yeah I'll be back I have a couple more ideas probably then even even even more than now thanks so much man see you all right take care [Music]

1) Ditch Discord, embrace the MidJourney web app at http://midjourney.com/. It's a game-changer, folks! 

2) Explore the "Explore" tab for inspiration. Use the search icon to find similar vibes and styles. Pro tip: Save prompts and styles you love for future use.

3) Style references are your secret weapon! Use the paperclip icon to apply a style without pulling in subject matter. It's all about aesthetic, baby! 

4) SREF codes = style coordinates in a multidimensional space. There are 4.6 BILLION options! Mix and match for endless possibilities. 

5) Balance is key! Play with style weights, personalization, and text prompts to find the perfect harmony. It's like mixing paint, but WAY cooler. 

6) Personalization is a MUST. Rate 1000+ images to teach MidJourney your aesthetic preferences. It'll change your AI art game forever. 

7) Use the editor to refine and expand your creations. Add frames, change backgrounds, and bring your digital art into the real world! 

8) Permutation prompts let you test multiple parameter values at once. Efficiency FTW! 

9) Think of MidJourney as a new artistic medium. It's not just AI – it's a whole new way to blend aesthetics and solve creative problems. 

10) The future is here: AI-powered robots painting, playing music, and bringing digital art to life. Get ready for the creative revolution! 

Remember: MidJourney isn't about playing slots. It's about mastering a new artistic language. Now go create some masterpieces!

I I think of me mid Journey as like a new medium entirely right like it's a different type of canvas it's a different way of problem solving you have not just paint but you have like entire Aesthetics that have all of these layers and this complexity and you're blending them and you're balancing them and you're finding this harmony in between to get somewhere that you really love and once you get that once you find that little recipe you can infinitely prompt into it right [Music] start Nick s Pierre in the house dude I am so happy you're here because I've been playing with mid Journey for a while but I need help to see the light okay I need help to see the light and you're just the man for the job I hope so I hope so what have you been messing around with what have you been doing over there I mean I've been doing everything you have told me not to which is using words words are great words words are still great don't get me wrong but they're they're just the tip of the iceberg here we can really do a lot more when we're using visuals to drive visuals as opposed to semantics to drive visuals we can kind of like explode out Aesthetics and style space into almost like infinite directions we don't have to rely so much on the base models interpretation of like our style tokens you know we could we could pave our own lane here I mean the only reason I I I I've been playing with prompts is because a bunch of people on Twitter are like these are the 10 you know prompts that you need to use on Mid Journey know I know and you know I it's funny because when I started doing all this mid Journey stuff that was the name of the game a lot of the features didn't they they didn't exist yet things like Styles space uh it was just words and parameters you could use images in your prompt uh like as an image prompt but it did different things it kind of pulled the subject matter and it pulled the elements of that image in uh which often wasn't what you wanted to do but that was the name of the game it was it was structuring that prompt and describing every little detail but in recent months they've released this whole idea of like Style Space they have style references they have character references um and they have this whole system that kind of explodes Aesthetics out into this infinite universe and it's so much more fun to kind of like dig into that world and play on like a more visual canvas as opposed to like oh what does it do if I say you know this keyword and blend it with some other keyword you know okay so this is what I'm here for so if you could spend some time just live cooking so that by the end of this episode people you know they're not going to know everything by by the end of this episode but they'll know enough to be dangerous okay enough to be dangerous I like that I'm gonna steal that let's I'm I'm gonna put that as like my my new tagline just enough to be dangerous we're building some weapons over here okay I'm going to show you a couple things I got I got a couple things that are useful um like resources I'll share those and I'll also kind of just walk you through just like a basic process of uh exploring an aesthetic and I should preface this by saying there's no one right way of of using this tool right like it's it's got a deep enough feature set now where the workflows you can employ are seemingly infinite so my way of doing this is my way you can use it as like a baseline but I hope you kind of find your own little Groove you know you find your own little flow your own little rhythm here that you can get into that kind of like fits your your Vibe you know um so I'll show you my vibe as a starting point so that it it kind of like gets the juices flowing so to speak perfect so let me ask you this before I share my screen do you have maybe a style of image or something in mind that we should explore around a general concept I kind of like to I kind of like to to start usually with like a subject and like maybe a medium if I'm after a particular medium like a painting or an illustration or a photograph um or something 3D but I it's it's nice to kind of start there because we can we can bend and flow around that concept yeah so I just tweeted this um and I and I tweeted I just put in the the Riverside chat so I don't know you yeah we're there we're there in our relationship you know ex yeah it's exciting it's very exciting all right let's let's see what you got here I tweeted when I need creative inspiration I look at old posters inspired these are perfect sir these are perfect you know why these are perfect because we could actually use them as a starting point we can we can build into these so these are great I'm going to save these I should share my screen so we can we can all see this right totally yeah share share your screen and some people are probably going to be like well well where do you find these old posters you know what do you type to get there and honestly places like Reddit Pinterest just like Googling um you know you'd be in in the image tab you'd be oh there we go we're we're we're we're we're sharing here yeah we're cooking we're cooking so these are are a Tokyo Tokyo Trade Fair a 1995 Tokyo Trade Fair so these simple minimalist kind of paper cutout looking Graphics we got bold colors simple shapes and forms but these are fun these are cool so I'm just saving these I'm just saving these I could also have grabbed the URLs but we'll save them and then I'm going to pop over into mid journey and now I'm I'm just starting on Mid journey.com so first tip if people aren't aware yet is get the hell out of Discord mid journey is no longer in Discord get out of there it's a hellish place to be you don't want to be working in in Discord you want to be working in the mid Journey web app it's open to everybody now just mid journey.com all right so head over there and you could pop into your create tab this is where you're going to be spending the most time but also just like you were finding inspiration in those posters on Pinterest on Reddit uh you can also start in mid journey and like the explore tab this is where all of the publicly available uh posts all the all the generations are going to show up so if your account is on the standard plan or below everything is kind of public by default when you're on the Pro Plan you can go into stealth mode and you can prompt privately so otherwise everything's up here so so there's a pretty vast library and you could type things like you know um vintage poster or something and you can get inspired through things like this and if you like a particular Vibe let's say you really like this style with the red boots you can hit this little search icon here and that kind of does like an image search so it's going to give you similar results that have similar subject matter and styles and everything so this is a cool way to explore too look this one's kind of the vibe right already this one's this one's not bad by DB smooth shout out DB smooth he's been playing with some stuff let's see let's see what the prompt was poster for the opening of an exhibition featuring a flat design with an eye in the center having a green Iris surrounded by blue black red purple colors kind of cool geometric sa colorful palette so it's almost like a a good description of what what had what you were working with so this is kind of cool and when you're in here you can like these things you know we can do that search like I said right get some other ideas but we can also on the bottom here we can see how we say use prompt so if we hit that it's just going to bring this prompt in which is kind of nice we can also say use style and if we do that it brings this image in as a style reference which you can note by the paperclip I'll get into that more in a second uh and then you can also use it as an image which functions a little bit differently than a style reference I'll explain the difference through the process um yeah this is this is a great way to explore too so you don't always have to start in Pinterest or wherever you can you can always pop in a mid Journey good source of inspiration so let's uh let's save this actually I'm just gonna save this and I'm gonna pop into my create tab so question yes in the ex like just to be clear everything I'm seeing in the explore tab those aren't those are images created on Mid Journey correct correct that's right everything here was made in mid Journey now when we click on these we'll see some people's like personalization codes sometimes you'll see an image in the prompt let's see if we can find one in a couple clips oh this is uh this is uh a friend here a friend Tatiana could tell by the style it's a very popular one uh but let's see is there an image somewhere in any of these doesn't look like it but sometimes there's a image included in the prompt as well and that'll show up so that's why it's important if you're using like for client work or for brand Brands and you're using your own imagery that you might not want to show up on a public uh database you want to be on that Pro Plan or above and make sure that you have stealth mode turn on so that those assets don't show up so that's that's important if you're working with client stuff I always like to reiterate that and when you want to turn on stealth mode in this little settings here on the right side of the of the promp bar you have this stealth down here you just want to make sure that's turned on and that way nothing will show up in this public database I mean I should have asked you in the beginning like why should people use mid journey I mean there's a million reasons honestly I mean professionally it's a huge like inspiration tool like it's a great way to just jam out an idea uh in the same way you might go and discover things and build a mood board through you know a Pinterest exploration or like Tumblr or just like Google image search or dribble or wherever um you could do the same in mid Journey except you actually have more control over it right uh so I think it's great for just sort of coming up with ideas uh putting together Concepts uh ideating and exploring U but you can also use it in production and it's a it's a really powerful tool especially now with the new editor feature which we can talk about uh for a second it lets you do a lot with your existing assets and kind of out paint add new elements into it there's a lot of cool stuff that you can start to do so um yeah but honestly it's just it's also just fun people use it as like almost like an art therapy in a way uh you can just get lost in it you know um so lots of reasons lots of reasons people are using it but I find it most like exciting as like a discover ability tool a discovery engine you know uh just get an idea putting in there see what the hell comes of it and then just go down this Rabbit Hole of exploring the aesthetic uh it's it's awesome dude it's it's addicting especially once you get into a flow yeah and I think especially when you get really good at it too so you know when I see like a top point0 one% mid Journey person I can't tell if it's mid Journey or not it's just this is an incredible piece of art and that art could live like personally like you can just have cool piece of personal art or you know that is on your website it's on your landing page and people connect with it or use it on as a social asset and people retweet it and just that the there's so much value in being able to uh take your idea from from here and turn it into a living breathing asset does design asset um and mid Journey just helps you do that so um yeah I'm all for for it it's the best and you have the most control you have the most creative control which is what I love about it uh it's also like a new medium but let's let's show not tell because I I could end up in a rabbit hole just talking about it so let me let me show you some cool stuff let's get your images in here first of all so I'm going to pull in some of these images that we had saved so let's pull a few of these in you can see I have some other ones that are uploaded in here but I just hit this little image icon here in my promp bar and I selected those files right so I'm able to drag these in now what's cool about this is when I when I drag them in I can start adding them to our prompt here and at first they're added in as an image prompt and as an image prompt they have this little icon here the little pict icon but there's as you see like there's three other things there's the paperclip which is a style reference that's what we're going to be using and then there's this little user icon it says as a character reference so we're not going to talk about that today I want to talk about Styles space and just kind of like exploring Aesthetics all right so let's start with just one let's start with just one start with this hand image I think it's actually my favorite so I'm going to start with this hand image and I'm going to select it the paperclip as a style reference and then what what should we prompt anything could be anything name name a subject it's like it's like a Mad Libs game remember Mad Libs of course of course grew up on that yeah so let's do like what's a subject that we could put in give me a noun um a giraffe giraffe so I'm just saying draft just straight up let's do uh let's do some other animals how about elephant how about a dog all right so we're starting just with the most basic idea here and a style reference so mid Journey kind of is going to try and look at this it's going to look at this style reference here understand what makes it what it is and it's going to try and integrate some of those elements into our image generations and we're starting at the most basic possible level because I like to see how mid journey is interpreting things so I'm giving it this style reference uh I don't give it a medium I don't talk about the lighting I don't talk about anything I just straight up giving it something like a giraffe and what this lets me do is interpret from the results how mid journey is interpreting the style reference and then from there I can make more guided decisions as to like where I wanted to go next right so in this case we can kind of see that rainbow effect coming in some of these results are giving us that more like illustrative look and feel but we still have things that are a bit photorealistic and we don't necessarily want this if we're trying to MCH this style right so there's already we have decisions that we can make we can use this prompt a little little shortcut is if you hover over you can hit use it'll just re add the prompt into your prompt bar little time save U so we might start by upping the style weight so we have these parameters that we can use to start to balance things out and one of those parameters is style weight d-w what this will let you do is determine how much influence that this style reference has over the generation so by default it's at 100 but it goes all the way up to a thand so if we run this at a th we're going to be much more likely to get something that looks and feels a bit more like our style reference than what we might have gotten without it right so we're starting to lean a little bit bit more in that direction but still we're getting some photo realistic results so now this is where we might want to play with our text prompt give it a little bit of assistance right so we might start out and say something like a paper cutout illustration of a draft so something that kind of gives it a little bit of support right along with the style reference and the whole name of the game honestly is just balance Harmony you have all of these levers that you begin to pull that are going to guide and push the Aesthetics in One Direction or the other and you just have to learn how to balance and find Harmony between them and see how just a little bit of assistance with the text prompt now we're in like a whole different world right we're starting to get more of that look and feel that we were after but we also might want to like play with the aspect ratio because we're after like a poster right so let's mess with that that's another parameter that we could use if we want like a poster print we might come in here and do a little parameter here D- AR and go how about like 2 by3 something that is more of a poster print uh layout right and this is going to change things too this is going to guide it and and help it fill that space uh a little bit better right so we're starting to get some cool stuff now notice like let's look at this style reference we're just using this image as the style reference right so mid journey is essentially looking at this image and it's trying to understand what makes it what it is and it tries to do that by decoupling aesthetic from subject matter uh now this is important because if we for example use this prompt but we switch this from a style reference to say an image prompt we can remove this style weight because we're no longer using it as a style reference but if we do this what mid is going to try and do is actually pull in more of the subject matter more of the actual pixels of the image that we're we're using and it's going to give a totally different look and feel right so it's it's starting to it's starting to kind of go more in the direction of our text prompt now uh and it's like just kind of pulling in maybe some of the colors of our image but it's it's not necessarily the quote like style of our image right um and this becomes more apparent as you up the weight so if we kind of made this image even more important in comparison to our text prompt m is going to try and P pull more elements of it into the generation and notice now with that image weight higher we're starting to get some of the hand that that's coming in right it's like trying to make a giraffe but our image is now so important that it's like a hand giraffe and things are getting a little bit wonky right so this this is an important distinction because a lot of times people will just you know they'll just drag an image in and by default it's an image prompt but there's a huge difference when click that little paper clip so this is this is very important U when you're working with images like this so let's go let's go back to where we were I will just hit this use which is going to pull the prompt in right um but now I want to drag in another image so let's let's kind of give it a little bit more uh more options here so with this image has a white background it has this like red Sun Starburst sort of uh effect right it has this rainbow that's very prominent has this text this blocky text and we can kind of see that starting to come through right like we have that red sort of sun circular figure that's pulling through we have that rainbow we have some text that's starting to appear right so that's all coming from this image but if we switch this image to that black background and we make this a style reference now let's see what happens I'm sure you can make a you can make a guess here as to what's going to happen huh quick ad break let me tell you about a business I invested in it's called boring marketing.com so a few years ago I met this group of people that were some of the best SEO experts in the world they were behind getting some of the biggest companies found on Google and the secret sauce is they 've got a set of technology and AI that could help you outrank your competition so for my own businesses I wanted that I didn't want to have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I didn't want to depend on ads to drive customers to my businesses I wanted to rank high in Google that's why I like SEO and that's why I use boring marketing.com and that's why I invested in it they're so confident in their approach that they offer a 30-day Sprint with 100% money back guarantee who does that now days so check it out highly recommend boring marketing.com no idea no idea what's going to happen oh it's changing a little bit it's changing a little bit so we get more of the blues that are coming in from this which is kind of interesting now we don't have a black background so it's still pulling that color but a different look and feel right a different look feel different and I think important to to note personally I didn't think that like if you would have asked me to to design this in my mind I probably wouldn't do this but this Vibe is like so interesting to me like I love it so much see now you're getting inspired right I'm getting inspired is what I'm trying to tell you yeah that's well this is the beautiful thing because now we could take this we can be like ooh this is a Vibe which one is there one in particular that you you vibing with uh yeah I mean I don't want people to start like judging me in it or anything but you know what this one reminds me of you remember uh Gumby you know Pokey from Gumby yeah yeah this guy's totally Pokey hey yeah there he is yeah we're back baby hey that's totally poke I watch that all the time as a kid I think I think the the one pro probably if I had to pick the one all the way on the right all the way on the right okay perfect so let's use this prompt but this time I'm going to swap out the style reference and let's just use this new image that we got why not right so we can kind of lean a bit more in this direction if we wanted to can run a couple of these but we can also come in here on our favorites click in and we can run some variations now variation subtle what they're going to do is keep most of the details of this of this image they're going to keep most of the details intact uh but it's going to change like the subtle things U variation strong are going to have more dramatic effects on the composition it'll still keep the the like General Vibe of the image and the general subject matter intact but it's going to switch up maybe like the location of the subject the size of the subject it's it'll be just a bit more dramatic right so see how those variations subtle here like very subtle and then here's our strong variations right so we're starting to get some cute stuff we're starting to get some cute stuff here and you know maybe maybe we really like this but we don't like the text we want to get rid of that text right well you can come in here you can hit that editor option and you could paint out this text we can just sort of mask it out and we could run this and mid journey is pretty good at figuring out that you'll want it to be removed but if you wanted to give it like a little bit of an extra hand you can come in here you can edit the prompt and mid Journey has this no parameter that you can use to tell mid Journey what you want removed from the generation so I might say no text or something um it's probably not necessary but just to show you um but we got a couple results right that didn't have the text we didn't we didn't even need to do that one thing I like to tell people too especially if they're new to the the web app instead of Discord as you go through and you're you're generating stuff make sure you like your favorites they have this little heart up here just want to make sure that you like your favorites it's going to make things way easier in the future when you're trying to find stuff in your library because every generation is four Images right so you're you're in mid journey in the weeds for a half hour all of a sudden you got hundreds of images and you're like I'm looking for that one image that they all look alike where the hell is that one that I really really liked U when you like it you can go over into your organize filter by liked and it'll be right there way easier to catch than trying to go through all of these right so I try to tell people always make sure you like your favorites either by clicking in hitting that heart button or right clicking and hitting the little like button there all right so we got some cool options uh how how did these go so this is where we swapped it out and we actually Ed this as a style reference right we used this other one as a style reference with our prompt and it kind of took it in its own little Direction which is kind of interesting and we could even do like we can we can combine so we might come in here use this prompt let's get rid of our no text actually we can keep no text we don't want text here um and let's drag one in here and set it as a style reference so now mid is going to kind of blend these Styles together and they're similar but they'll each bring their own little unique flare into the mix right U and just to kind of clarify what's going on here CU there's there's already a few things that are starting to happen we have our aesthetic levers I like to call them right Greg we have our style references that's one aesthetic right we have our text prompt and in this case we're talking about a medium a paper cutout illustration so that's getting interpreted and then we have these parameters like our our style weight which is determining how much of that style reference how much of that is turned up right and we can start to layer other things in so mid Journey has something called personalization which you get by rating a bunch of images and it's it's super simple and everybody should do it this personalized tab over here you just click on that start teaching and you just select your favorite you don't have to overthink it but you just select the one that you're most interested in and if you don't like like any you can skip it and mid Journey starts to learn your preferences just through this process and oops I'm going to undo that one because this one is actually super sick and the more you do it the more it learns about you it learns things like what kind of colors do you prefer the lighting the general style more photographic or more illustrative uh do you like certain animals do you like certain ethnicities to come through starts to learn all these things and the more you rate the more it learns about you but this does wonders to changing the Aesthetics and I highly highly recommend everybody do this as like one of the first things that they do go into personalize and rate like a thousand images it's going to make everything better I promise I'll show you a quick example of this before we keep going here I know we're bouncing around a lot so if you need to just get me back on track you just holler Greg I'm here but uh I'm just going to go wi because there's just so much right but Let's do let's do a little simple example because I think it really illustrates the personalization effect so if I said something like photo of a uh of a woman right just a just a standard prompt let's do AR let's do 3x two it fills the screen nicely and I'm going to turn stylize all the way up now I'm hitting you with something new again stylize is how much of the model that mid Journey model right now we're on v6.1 how much of the Aesthetics that are sort of curated by the community how much of that do we want applied to our text prompt versus just the interpretation of our text prompt and high stylized values are going to look more like mid journey in a sense um which is to say like the default of the model right so it'll become super obvious when we run this a couple times we'll do stylize a thousand the default is 100 so the default kind of balances your text prompt with the mid Journey Aesthetics but it's not like super heavy on the mid Journey Aesthetics so it still gives you a little bit of creative leeway versus a thousand here where it just like screams AI right it's like sew in-your-face AI uh versus 100 right which has a little bit of a maybe more balanced look so these are the default Aesthetics these are default to the model what personalize does is it essentially fine-tunes the model to your aesthetic preferences to what you like which is really really interesting so if I run this same prompt here and I just turn on personalization now instead of getting the c community curated mid Journey default out the box aesthetic it's taking my fine-tuned and uh more balanced aesthetic so I I tend to like more analog photography I like a lot of black and white stuff I like kind of like heavy blacks bold uses of color lots of like dramatic light and Shadow so you can start to see that coming through and if I turn this all the way up to that s1000 which is what gave us this prompt or or this job right without personalization turned on just super heavy AI super mid Journey this is fine- tune to my aesthetic totally different Universe right totally different Universe um and everybody has their own little style references like if we go into explore here we could probably find one let's grab let's grab our friends here all right and I'm just going to click on this click on this click on this and now we'll let this Roll by the way I'm really happy you're covering this because my biggest qualm with mid journey is I don't want it to look like very mid Journey as you'd say like very classic mid Journey so I didn't even know that this existed that this was a lever that I can pull and it's I can just pull it back oh yeah oh yeah it makes a huge difference personalization is something everybody should do and it's probably going to be default with V7 um but they're really pushing for it so this is uh my friend Tatiana um she's got similar Vibes to Me Maybe not as dark she's like the the angel to my devil everything everything I do is like dark and Gothic and hers is usually a little bit more bright and playful but you can see the difference just same prompt just our personalizations getting added into the mix and we could even blend these if we wanted so I can take her personalization and then hit mine and then we're going to blend them together right we could even come in here and I could say well I want I want three parts of uh Tatiana I only want two parts of mine and I want that blend to only be applied uh at like a level of 500 to this prompt right so you start to get all of these aesthetic levers that are doing interesting things and you're just trying to find balance and Harmony so this is our straight blend versus something maybe a little bit more more balanced um but this is where you start to like really explode out Aesthetics and get into interesting territory so let's let's head back to our uh to our draft here all right so we got we got a little cutout here a little image the black background got this no text that we're adding we got the style weight turned all the way up but I'm going to turn the style weight down a little bit and I'm going to add in my personalization let's run this a couple times by the way see this little shortcut I'm doing here all I'm doing after I hit enter is hitting the up arrow on my keyboard and it's automatically populating the last prompt I ran big big time save for sure dude you know this also got me thinking too is like in the future mid Journey should create a marketplace where you can sell your personalization people are starting to kind of do that they're putting together um like their own style reference books their little style reference books and like curating different looks for different types of prompts um it's kind of cool i' I've made a tool actually uh I can share it with you so you can you can put the link in the description yeah but this is a style reference Explorer so it has like 40,000 images like about 10, I think there's like 15,000 style references that are in here and these are the codes so let me let me actually back up a second because I haven't introduced you to style reference codes which is a different universe so these images could be used as a style reference but when you click on one you see this prompt it's got this code SRE with this random number and these codes are kind of like coordinates in this like multi-dimensional Style Space that kind of direct you to a location and then anything that you prompt is going to be influenced by that location so it's kind of like uh if if you like get deep with it it's kind of like a seed and it kind of fixes this point in style space that you can prompt into um but there's two to the 30 second power srf codes like 4.6 something billion right um and people are essentially like mining these out of mid Journey finding the best ones curating them into lists and then like adding their personalization into it mixing their little like text prompt flavoring into the mix and building these like aesthetic recipes if you will that are really really interesting and this is this is the name of the game really like this is where things start to get really interesting so I could come in here and I can uh instead of using an image I can use let's use our our prompt here instead of using an image I can use an srf code so let's let's drop all this stuff let's just go srf and I'm going to pull something let's do like um let's do paper cutout I'm just using my tool here so I could search by like style Vibe theme and explore these aesthetic reference codes more visually which is nice right so I kind of like this this is a Cool vibe what do you think not bad right oh yeah I'm into it I'm into it so we can just click on this srf here copies it to our clipboard and then I could paste this in all right and then let's get rid of this paper cutout let's just kind of keep it illustration of a draft and let's run this a couple times and now this prompt is going to get interpreted against this style and you can see that starting to come through right pretty cool it's crazy it's crazy that's so crazy and what's cool is we could start to blend these Styles together like paint so like we I kind of think of them is like paint on a palette right this is this is a style that's bringing certain elements into the mix what's interesting about it though is like unlike paint which is just going to be a color right these Styles these reference codes they represent all sorts of stuff it's color it's composition it's lighting it's texture it's pattern it's it's all the these things right and all those things get balanced with your text prompt with your parameters with any other elements that you add into your prompt they can start to change mix blend and you get these really crazy sort of amalgamations right these these like little potions these little style potions that start to percolate up so I might see something like this and say okay that's cool but maybe we want to add a little something into the mix maybe we want to add I I don't know how about like like a glazed ceramic kind of look to it let's see what happens if we do that so I can come in here and search for something like glaze ceramic right and I can just visually explore and look for something that kind of fits the vibe let's do something like this because it's kind of shiny it's got a little shiny look to it still got similar colors but maybe this will bring a little a little like Chrome iium into the mix you know what I mean so I'm just going to copy that srf code and I'm going to paste it in I don't need to do the double sref I just need to make sure there's a space here so now I got style number one which is this style blending with this new style that I just added into the mix with this illustration of a prompt or illustration of a draft prompt right so I can run this now and I'm blending those two and we're going to see how this turns out and the name of the game is again it's it's balance it's Harmony but it's also like visually analyzing your results and deciding is that actually what I want is that doing the thing that I need you know what else could I bring into the mix to make this even more interesting and you could start to explore and and play with the the different weights the different values to get to a desired outcome right and what do we got here these are looking kind of sweet yeah dud this looks to me that looks like like those those new sets like this is a children's book that is a cover of a children's book 100% it would work right yeah we can give him a name yeah fall in love with this guy and like we can what I like to do when I find something that's interesting is I kind of like to I like to explore parameter values I want kind of explode out this aesthetic mix into a few different directions and see which way I lean so there's a couple ways that you can you can do that um you can do that by adding more information to your text prompt and that'll add more for Mid journey to kind of like chew on right uh right now we have it super simple illustration of a draft so there's a lot that's left unsaid we can detail this out if we wanted to but I'm just going to keep it simple for the time being I want I want the randomness that mid Journey brings into the equation here but maybe we play with the the balance of these different values right this first part this was that more illustrative one that we had down here and then this other one brought something else into the mix let's first actually run that other one by itself so we can see how it's interpreted solo and then that should give us a little bit more of a clue as to like how these two are blending together here in the middle right so interesting it's like it's like a totally different Universe right uh it it's kind of bringing in some of those more shiny textures but it's definitely a little bit far off from maybe what we had here but the Blended result is really interesting still so we can we can kind of play with this I'm going to take this this Blended result and I want to I want to get maybe let's try changing the weight of that more illustrative one I'm going to use this this syntax here this double colon by putting this double colon here at the at the end let me zoom in a little bit more so we got our style reference and then immediately that double colon with the number I'm essentially saying I want two parts of this style and one part of this style so I can run that that and then I can even I can flip it so I can say I want one part of that style and let's do two parts of this style and I could run this little experiment here and see which I like more and and these These are kind of like the important little things that you could do once you kind of find a mix is you you're trying to get a sense of why things are happening the way they're happening right we don't want to play the slot machine game I want to be able to more specifically yeah I guess that's always been my uh my issue with playing with mid journey is I felt like I was playing a SLO machine like that I was just I was trying to get it to do something and of course I wanted a a bar bar bar to get you know or jackpot jackpot jackpot to get that jackpot but Dude triple maybe yeah give me a triple seven and I I what's cool about this is I I've never thought about it like this I never thought about it it really does bring new meaning to the expression steal like an artist totally right totally I I love like I I think of mid Journey as like a new medium entirely right like it's a different type of canvas it's a different way of problem solving you have not just paint but you have like entire Aesthetics that have all of these layers and this complexity and you're blending them and you're balancing them and you're finding this harmony in between to get somewhere that you really love and once you get that once you find that little recipe you can infinitely prompt into it right you can start to mash things together you can do so much once you're in that world but you actually can build up that world and you have a lot more control over the aesthetic direction of that world than than one usually would think in these AI tools because we're no longer confined by the inter interpretation of text by the model right that is super limiting because every time I prompt a certain word I'm always going to get a certain look but visuals are much more complic like complex right they they can't be put in this semantic box pictures worth a thousand words right so you can only get so far with text prompting this is where you really start to get into the weeds here and do the cool that you just can't do literally anywhere else um it's just like a whole new way of blending you know it's awesome um and like even here like I'm I'm liking this style the most I think like I think these are really sick yeah so like I have a good sense of like what's doing what in this case with these with these little uh balances here right like this more illustrative look versus this other here and and I I think I kind of like it balanced I want to add my personalization into the mix just another aesthetic lever that I can play with give it a little run right and I'm just I'm just tossing into the mix seeing how it how it fits things are getting a little bit darker right but it might be a little bit more my style yeah I was just going to say like that has Nick St Pierre written all over it that's right it's because it's all it's trained on me baby it's trained on me and if I wanted more of that I have a lever to pull I have that stylized lever I can pull it up a little bit and now I'm I'm increasing the level of personalization and that's getting balanced with these style references which are getting balanced with my text prompt right so I'm starting to push it in the directions that I want to head in and even something like this right I could lower the style weight so I can say maybe I want my my style references to have less of a of a impact I want to give the text prompt and my personalization more room to breathe well I can I can drop that style weight from 100 to say 50 and something I like to do especially with these parameter values is use a permutation prompt which is where you can put things in Brackets and separate it by commas and just kind of run a bunch of stuff at once so I kind of come in here and I like to do a little permutation prompt like this and then when I run it now I just ran all of those values in one go and I'll be able to quickly get a visual figure out where I actually like want to play in like where what level is the best for me and then I can like dig deeper into that right so we got our style weight that we're testing here at various levels and notice how when our style weight dips below that default of 100 we're starting to end up in like different territory right um it's changing the aesthetic but as we go up higher and higher it's becoming more more My Vibe and I I think I kind of like it I like the I like the style weight a little heavier in these These are these are sick like this guy let's take a step let's take a step back this is if you saw this at the MoMA like in a frame and someone was like this is a $10 million piece of art by I don't know van go or something you'd be like okay you let's put it let's put it in a frame at the moment this is actually a good little segue into the editor all right so we'll go to the editor here let's adjust the aspect ratio we'll go 16 by9 let's make this a little smaller let's kind of put it over here and and let's say a let's change the prompt let's say a framed illustration of a giraffe against a white Gallery wall uh the floor is made of or the gallery floor let's say the gallery floor is made of light pine wood all right let's run that let's see what happens and let's let's actually remove these srfs here so this is an important note so I'm editing the prompt right I'm filling in all this new space we don't know what's going to happen here but I actually want to get rid of these SFS because I I don't want the style to be to be this style right I want the style to be uh just like a more regular style a more traditional style all right so let's go and let's even put like photo of and I'll even drop like style raw which leans a little bit more photorealistic let's try this out see how it does so here it's like it it was kind of trying but we had those style references up so we were kind of fighting against our prompt in a sense but when we we removed them see now we're starting to get somewhere damn now we're starting to get somewhere maybe maybe we need to make it a little bit smaller let's go back into the editor maybe this guy needs to be a little bit smaller so that he's not leaning on the floor and let's let's run this again see if we get something better maybe we can even expand this up a little but I want to make sure that that floor has room to come in let's try a couple of these there we go now we're cooking now we're at the moment baby yeah you know what I'm gonna do something fun I've got a friend of mine in the lobby right now for my next podcast let's bring him in here get him in here all right he's in here he has no idea this is happening what's happening introduce introduce yourself what's up man how are you guys hey Nick nice to meet you nice to meet you too man we're just prompting over here what's up with you uh not much excited to do this podcast I've been you know it actually you know was a good reminder that I should I I went on this walk I took my dog on a long walk and I was like hey I have this podcast coming up on Monday I should think more creatively about like problems that I have that there should be solutions to so it made for a nice walk for her because we were just walking around the Westside Highway here in New York for two hours just thinking about cool stuff who you and you and your dog yeah just me and my dog going on a long walk and just thinking about things to build what what was your pup's ideas any any good ideas uh you know I wish she contributed she didn't contribute much um it was mostly just me um I like so I like going on long walks it's hard to do this in New York City where there's constant traffic and you know West Side Highway though is beautiful it I'm in New York myself and and I hop on a city bike and I cruise up and down Westside highway it's like that's my like free free time to think you know yep yep um exactly so I I live right on the West Side Highway so I just walk south and then I'll just do a giant Loop and then it'll come back up and um but yeah it was it was a perfect weekend for just kind of idea brainstorming um so excited to with you guys sorry to interrupt I have one so just have one question for you yeah and then we're gonna go into our own separate pod but this is Nick has been cooking up a funky giraff on Mid Journey my perspective on Mid Journey up until this last hour has been that it's crappy kind of like it's not real art you're a designer you you know you were a co-founder of loom you helped design Loom sold for like a billion dollars or something and when you look at this giraffe is this not a beautiful giraffe I mean it looks like something I would see in Moma oh my God are you serious like I I honest to God if you printed a million of these and just had a exhibit in Moma I don't think anyone would ever guess that it was made using AI dude I literally just said that he just said that I just I just ran 40 of them because now I need to see all the best ones so just uh I'll kind of end on this we've been kind of just fussing around for a little bit here want to want to see the journey that we went on yes went on a little bit of Journey so we started down here we started down here with okay starts with do it started with a well actually it did start with a draft it did start with a draft we've been we've been keeping true to the draft but we were using one of these posters that uh that Greg had curated for as a style reference and then we just were playing with that a little bit taking a look at the different little aesthetic levers that we could pull on showcasing some of the differences between personalization of the model versus uh the default model and then we just started exploring these srf codes we went over into my my little tool here and we started searching by Vibe what did we search for I think it was paper cutout right yep paper cutout Vibe and we were just kind of scrolling through until we found something that was that was was interesting I don't know which one it was exactly it was this Gallery this gallery of artwork is all um created by the community presumably so oh this was the one that we used it was it was all mind um so I go through there's like two to the 302 power of these style references these srf codes yeah and each kind of is like coordinates to its own little aesthetic universe and so whenever you add them to your prompt anything that you prompt is going to be influenced by the Aesthetics of that universe so we were we were playing with these and getting some cool results we were getting some of these results and then we were going back and blending a couple others so we were searching for like glaze ceramic and trying to find some other Vibes that we can bring into the mix and we ended up bringing in this one this srf code so we're just kind of like visually exploring and just trying to find things that we feel fit that feel cool right um and when we Blended those we ended up here and we're like okay we're on to something these are kind of sick right um and then we were just kind of like exploring what each of them does individually playing with different weights to kind of see what what they do at at different values and then I turned on my my personalization which is like the model tune to my aesthetic preferences based on my image ratings and then we were upping like the heavy-handedness the influence of that personalization how how much do we want my my preferences to kind of like influence the image generation and these are those higher levels so this is like that blend of those two codes the blend of those Aesthetics mix with this illustration uh text prompt and then my my uh personalization turned up to 500 and then the style weight so the influence of those Sr codes turned all the way up and we ended up in these really cool little uh little space here and then this is I just ran 40 of them so you can just go through beautiful it's art I should put them back here so this is what I'll kind of leave you guys with this so something that I'm working on is physically manifesting latent space this is the this is the idea here so we're building a lab downstairs here in Red Hook in partnership with Pioneer Works um and we're we're essentially trying to create a a space for people to come and learn how to use these tools at a deep level not just mid Journey but all of the creative AI tools um but also equipment so that they can bring it to life so it's not just existing digitally but we got robots that are learning to paint we got robots that are learning to play music we have big printers 3D printers plotter printers big editing stations where people can bring these into like image to video models start bringing them to life making a move and put together these really interesting pieces so in the very near future what I'll probably be doing I think I have to do it now with this giraffe let me make sure I like the giraffe so I don't lose them let's make sure I like this guy okay we got him liked is uh we're going to paint this on a big oh canas yeah and then we'll we'll actually go and get it in the mom that's the new goal now we got to get this draft in New York Moma I'll take SF Moma I'll take any M literally I please donation Nick this has been this has exceeded my expectations and my expectations to be honest were pretty damn high so thank you for coming on and teaching us how to make you know van go level you know jffs on the Fly I actually think this is going to change a lot of people's lives um and make them happier and wealthier just through this process and uh besides going to Red Hook in in the near future where could people get to know you better uh Twitter Twitter I I do a course on this stuff so it's just like every thing we went through is kind of like the introduction to a much deeper course that I that I go through over on Maven um which you can check out if you feel inclined but I'm I'm posted on Twitter uh but mostly I've been uh playing Bob the Builder dude I'm just trying to get this lab up and running I'm doing Ikea runs I'm over here hanging paintings and moving from point A to point B I can't wait for it to be done so that we can get back to to cooking it's been it's been like uh like six weeks of just you know physical labor I miss my computer I miss my canvas but we're we're getting back to it but definitely come by Red Hook especially are you in New York too Greg I'm in Miami but I heard New York is like a suburb of Miami so or the other way around yeah close enough close enough and then sh um come by I I'm going to text Greg an invite to a show that we're doing doing at Pioneer Works in two days so that you can come would love to co all right Nick later [Music]

Title: How to build a $1M+ Consumer SaaS App (step-by-step guide)
Published: 2024-11-13 16:58:40 UTC
Description:
Join me as I chat with Joseph Choi, Founder of Viral App Founders Community, as we discuss his frameworks and strategies for finding and building profitable Consumer Apps. Learn his step-by-step formula to building and growth hacking apps. 

Episode Timestamps: 
00:00 Intro
03:48 Ecom Marketing Strategies applied to Consumer Apps
10:55 TikTok Shop Affiliate Center  = goldmine for app ideas
22:03 Profitable Niches that are Underserved
33:14 Influencer Marketing 2.0
40:45 Capitalize on internet "cults" & movements

1) TikTok organic = BIGGEST underpriced distribution channel right now
- Cost of creating & distributing content = low
- Potential reach for consumer apps = high
- Time to leverage this opportunity! 

2) E-commerce tactics are invading the app world
- Remember Tabs Chocolate? 0 to $10M/year with mass UGC creators
- Now these tactics are being used for consumer SaaS 
- Higher margins + better exit multiples = Bigger Opportunity

3) Carousels perform better than Short-form video on TikTok?!
- Surprising trend: Photo carousels are CRUSHING IT
- Easier to create + more scalable than talking head vids
- Pro tip: Use Midjourney for quick, eye-catching visuals 

4) TikTok Shop Affiliate Center = goldmine for app ideas
- Find top performers in any niche
- Build apps to help them sell better
- Get free marketing from influencers

Win-win-win situation! 

5) High LTV niches are UNDERSERVED on TikTok
Think: Golfers, poker players, niche sports
Example: Golf swing analysis app

- 10k downloads / month
- $70k revenue / month
- Huge potential for more!

6) Myth: TikTok users are all young
- Reality: Diverse demographics, especially in niche content
- Serve content to underserved niches = Underpriced reach

7) Rethink influencer marketing for TikTok
- Old way: Pay for followers
- New way: Hire creators as ACTORS, not for their audience
- TikTok algorithm favors good content, not follower count 

8) Capitalize on internet "cults" & movements
Examples:
- Looksmaxing (YouMax app)
- Make money online (Crayo app)
1. Find passionate communities without products
2. Build the app they need 
3. Profit 
Bonus tip: Product quality is CRUCIAL
Nail your metrics before scaling marketing efforts!

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
there are apps that are getting millions of downloads because they've mastered Tik Tok and it's kind of a black box for most of us so I brought on Joseph Choy this guy knows exactly the formula for how these apps are getting users he breaks it down and uh you're going to love it people charge $5,000 for this sort of thing but I'm giving to you for free all you got to do is listen and take notes enjoy the [Music] episode all right Joseph Choy on the Pod this guy doesn't want to talk about B2B marketing at all and that's okay uh because he's the guy to talk to when you want to blow up your consumer app and today he I mean you tell us Joseph what do you want to talk about today yeah let's talk about uh viral consumer apps uh I've been seeing a lot of people making a lot of money on uh pretty much getting all their users from these really simple Tik Tok videos so I want to go through uh a few things um some quick wins like that you can just copy these apps and get 10K Mr within a couple months probably if you just copy the content copy the app uh do some slight differentiation but I think think there's also like legit opportunity for people who are more ambitious want to build bigger businesses and like Tik yeah the overall theme is I think that Tik Tok organic is probably the biggest um underpriced distribution Channel right now and yeah just the cost of creating Distributing content is just so low that I think all types of consumer apps um can be using these strategies great you know yes the answer is yes we want to know more about that we see we've been seeing more of that on on Twitter people have been like sharing like how this company got you know four million uh four million downloads in like 90 days and are making $3 million a month with some AI app so people people want to know and they want to figure it out and and let's let's learn yeah yeah I mean one of the biggest trends that I've seen is that these all these tactics are basically being stolen from the e-commerce space so Tik Tok shop got released I think in November of 2022 so it's only been two years since Tik Tok shop came out and so we've only had like two years of Tik Tok um marketing Innovation so the space is still super new but um what I've seen is like for example tabs chocolate they went from zero to 10 million a year um for an e-commerce product this chocolate company and they basically use these Mass ugc creators hiring tons of teenagers putting them all in a Discord server and then just mass-producing content every single day and the founder of that Oliver he he pivoted from tab's chocolate to a micro sass that helps people do their homework uh in in college um and it's really interesting because they're basically using the same tactics um in their marketing but now it's a SAS it's a consumer SAS business so instead of eCommerce where you have like 20 30% margins it's now a micro SAS and you get you know 90 plus percent margins and a higher exit multiple if you decide to sell the business so I wanted to show you a couple of uh marketing trends that the e-commerce space is doing right now and I think there's a lot of ideas that you can take from the e-commerce space and then kind of build apps uh around the same marketing strategies uh so one of them is uh colostrum so this is like an example of a video uh POV you divorced bread so this video got I think something like 700,000 views um it starts by the way this is all AI so this picture is mid Journey it's not even real food um but it's povu divor for spread is kind of a funny hook and then it just goes through by the way the audio is I think a Joe Rogan like clip or I don't know who this is maybe it's hubman or someone but um you know Common pain points energy brain fog metabolism by the way also I use colostrum and you should go to Miracle moo on Amazon so if this video gets I don't know uh 700,000 views and you know 0.5% to 1% % of the people actually close their app they go to Amazon they check it out um even if that conversion rate's pretty small they're going viral with the same types of videos every single day and this is not even the same uh this is not even the only account so they figured out this one content format that works and now they pump out these mid-journey stories like every day um but they're pushing all the traffic to uh to e-commerce which is interesting because you know you could do the same exact story like theoretically um with similar pain points but then solve the pain points with an App instead so here's an example of the same thing but for an app so Tik Tok uh strong negative hook Our Guest hated the controversial rules we enforc at our wedding and then it goes to the rules don't ask photographer for pictures no kids at the wedding no plus one ones don't post photos before us and then the last slide is we had our guests use the POV app which is a disposable camera app that they can use to take pictures pictures at the wedding um and this account does the same thing so they have all these slideshows and looks like they're experimenting with some AI actors more recently but they they pretty much post these wedding wedding angle stories for like you know every day and this is also mid Journey the the faces and stuff are getting really realistic this is also kind of weird but they have the like I think they at some point they realize that the like cake on the face image as the first image like gets views for some reason so they just prompt the mid journey to do that same hook um every time so I don't know just weird stuff like that where like you you can never predict what consumers will respond to um so I think a lot of this game is just like trying a bunch of random stuff and then seeing what works but then once you figure out what works you can just Spam it every day um so the POV app is doing super well with this um content format so quick reactions so far so one is that when people think Tik Tok they think short form video and the examples that you're showing is character CS um so that's just a surprise for me I guess is that um it's it's by the way a happy surprise like it's way easier for me to create a photo on Mid Journey than it is to go and create a video just from a effort perspective so uh just surprising that that carousels are working so well that's completely true and I what I've heard um from people in both the e-commerce and the app space is that um slides are generally lower converting um because there's less of that human feeling of an influencer talking to you you know with a talking head video um but you know there's a lot more scale and it's like the the barrier to entry like you said is so much easier so I have seen talking head and I wanted to get to that too um of influencers you know talking to the camera um selling various things but if you're just getting started and you don't know how to hire influencers you don't have the budget then this is like super easy way to start out um one issue that the industry has right now is this company called goalie um basically they're a supplement company and they sell all sorts of supplements uh including ashwaganda is like one of their most popular ones and they do these talking head videos um the so basically what Tik Tock shop is is it's a platform on on top of Tik Tok where you can as an e-commerce brand you can upload your brand and your products to the site and then uh creators can sign up to affiliate for your product and they just make videos automatically so you don't have to hire them sign contracts or anything you just upload the product and they just start making videos and then they take an automatic affiliate cut so you can set your affiliate cut at whatever you want 15 20% is typical and then people will just start making videos so Tik Tock shop was a huge gold rush in the past like two years but then over time Brands started to catch on and goalie was one of these Brands and now if you search like goalie Creator prizes they give away they're giving away like insane prizes to top Affiliates um um to just basically have a monopoly on all the creators so for example they have these like you if you sell $7,000 in gmv you get a MacBook Pro if you sell you know 45k you get a Rolex if you sell 250k you get a BMW 500k you get a Tesla um and this is on top of the affiliate commissions so you get the 20% commission and you get these prizes and goalie has said themselves that this this is not profitable but it just makes it really hard to compete um for these talking head creators because they're just all making videos for for goalie um goalie is not the only one there's a couple other supplement companies that are sort of monopolizing all these creators so that's another reason um to go to slideshows um it's just yeah the the competition is a lot less um but I also wanted to talk about an opportunity potential to ride the goalie wave uh if you wanted to hear about that unless you had some more stuff to say about these yeah yeah let's let's do it so uh here's an interesting tool that I think not many people are looking at right now so if you go to the Tik Tok shop affiliate Center you can find a lot of really good data on exactly what Tik Tock shop products are being sold in high volumes on Tik Tok so you can sort it by industry too so you you can find creators that are selling all these different products so and the filters are really good so for example let's let's try to find supplement creators um or Let's do let's do a different one let's say like skincare so here's here's all the stuff that has to do with skincare and you can sort by um performance too so you can find people that have between 100 and 10,000 total gmv so now basically I've selected all the skincare Tik Tok shop Affiliates who do uh medium range uh gmv so the opportunity that I see with this is all these Tik Tok shop creators are being being incentivized by these huge e-commerce companies to make all these videos but they're just selling e-commerce products and I feel like they could all be selling apps instead so if dude you read my mind like what are you doing you know what I mean it's like I almost it's crazy that we're going to publish this episode because I think that so many people are going to listen to this and I think it actually will change the Dynamics of Tik Tok shop I think so too I I I kind of held this in for a little bit because I run the community of consumer app Founders and I've been sharing this with the members so I'm sorry to my members but I'm gonna leak the alpha um but I mean this is just kind of the game with Tik Tok like the tactics are always evolving there's always going to be something new some new Edge but this is something that I think I think the entire industry will benefit from um if everyone starts making videos for apps instead of e-commerce then there'll be more content formats more video Trends to follow and yeah just like a lot more innovation in the space so I mean you can do this for so many different niches it doesn't have like skin care like for example there's this app called what colors and it's a color analysis app so basically it's like people that want to know what type of clothes or what type of makeup um works best with their hair color and their skin tone and their eye color um they can use color analysis and typically it's like a it's a you know high high paid consultant who's you know doing the color analysis for you but now they've put it into an app and they use AI to analyze your you know the colors on your face and your hair and stuff like that um and this app promotes the uh this video promotes this app so this video got almost a million likes so this app is doing very well um and it's yeah it's just another simple slideshow and then CTA is You Know download the what colors from the App Store um and do we know do we know the business model of what colors like how how they charge it's uh so a lot of these apps that are like single single utility apps are just uh pay wall so you onboard onto the app you answer a few questions and then they hit you with the pay wall you pay weekly or annually and uh then you can scan your face typically they have you scan your face first so you're kind of bought in and then it does the pay wall and then you pay sub subcriptions um which is also by the way subscriptions I think one of the other reasons why the consumer apps are having such a boom is because of um uh the Double Tap to pay like I think that Apple pay that simple like ux change has changed people's perception of uh of iOS subscriptions like the if you look at the past five 10 years of iOS subscriptions the the revenue is just blowing up um like apps have always existed you know there was a the 2000s you know app boom and then um but none of those apps were monetized they're all free now like people are actually paying for apps so this is um yeah this is one of these apps that you you pay for for as a subscription um well I can give it a little more color to that so as someone who was building apps during like when the App Store came out and you know back then 20 2009 2010 you know 2011 back then the distribution like how you got people how you got millions of users into your app was the App Store the app store would feature you and you would get hundreds of thousands of downloads per week um and that worked until it didn't work um now what is the equivalent of the App Store to today it's Tik Tok it's Instagram these are places where people discover content how many people are opening up the app store and and thinking oh give me a app to download today like that's just not how how it works anymore it worked when you were getting your first iPhone and you and you you wanted apps to make your phone more functional just doesn't work anymore that's great that's really great context and but the thing is also is like once you get that to top of funnel distribution through Tik Tok then people start downloading your app then you do rise in the ranks and then now you have uh search uh you know ASO um App Store optimization um so you will so you'll actually start getting organic downloads just from t uh from the App Store um if you get a kind of boost so you do this Tik Tok stuff once and you benefit for forever um um so yeah great context with that um but yeah the reason why I was bringing up what colors is like if you go to these like if you think about what kind of app could you do for skin care like you could do a skincare version of what colors where you analyze your face and then you suggest skincare products for example and one of the hardest parts of going viral on Tik Tok is making videos that uh get views but then also convert so you want to sell you want to actually sell a product you don't just want you know the vanity metric of number of views um and typically the more the harder you sell the product the fewer views that you get um but these Tik Tok shop Traders are the top 1% of the people who know how to do that right because they're getting organic views and they're selling High volumes of gmv so I think this is actually the gold mine like finds Tik Tok shop creators because they know how to make the style of video and then have them promote apps to take it a level deeper you could actually make an app that helps them s that helps them sell the products that they're already selling so if they're selling skincare products e-commerce you know cream or whatever you can like like for example you could make a skincare app that analyzes your face and you could do a before and after video where you say hey today I'm going to you know uh try this skin care versus this skincare product and then uh you know look at the results after a week and then you you briefly show the app and you show the interface and you scan the the influence like the influencer scans her face um before and after and then shows the transformation and it's about it's about the e-commerce product but then the app is being used as a utility to show that transformation and you don't even need to mention the app or you could mention it very casually in a nonthreatening way um and this is another it's just another scale thing like if you reach out to all these influencers I bet they would use it use the app in their Tik Tok shop affiliate videos for free because it actually helps them make content so you could get you could get the marketing completely for free and you could do this for any Niche like doesn't have to be skincare there's so many niches like makeup Personal Care um fashion you know Electronics Sports um Home Improvement um Collectibles jewelry home supplies so what whatever people are selling just help them to sell the thing better yeah I I also think that what's cool about the the app approach is it's way harder to get a stranger to drop $100 on some product from an influencer that they've never heard about and way easier for them to just double click on uh you know download an app double click again and spend five bucks you know so that's another interesting thing about uh digital products is uh yes the the price point might be a lot lower but the actual volume might be a lot higher that's so true yeah like some of the weekly prices on these apps is like $2 a week or $10 a week um or the annual is like you know $30 to $60 a year um but the cost of goods on that is basically zero so if you just it's it's you know infinitely scalable um I have uh some like high Revenue uh per user ideas um that we could look at if that would be interesting you're an angel you're an absolute Angel so um okay think about okay so the I think there's a myth that Tik Tok users are all young um I think generally it's it's basically true but there's still wide range of demographics on Tik Tok and if if you if you serve content to um a niche of people on Tik Tok where there's not as many creators um your content's going to be underpriced and you're still going to be reaching these demographics so uh like who who has a lot of money to pay to pay for products it's like one idea is golfers and this idea has been circulating on on Twitter for a little bit but uh if you search like uh if you go on to Tik Tok creative Center and you go on keyword insights you can see what people are searching for on Tik Tok and then you can find related videos to these things so one idea that a couple of people are already jumping on right now is the golf swing analysis um and you know you could build an app that takes that takes a live view of your uses the camera to take a live view of your golf swing analyzes it the angle and the speed and everything and gives you tips on how to improve that and um it's like a golf it's like a AI golf coach basically um and if you look at the videos that exist in this Niche for example improve your golf swing like these videos already exist so they're they're promoting these app this app I think is talking about um it's like a GPS tracker so it shows you how far you hit the the ball um but there's also this other swing analysis if you go on sensor Tower and you search um uh like golf swing uh there's the top app I think is has 10,000 downloads a month and it's making $70,000 a month which is a pretty crazy um Revenue per download um ratio compared to some of these other apps um BEC You know probably because you know this demographic is willing to pay a lot more for for things well also the alternative that's one piece and I actually uh I signed up for golf I'm I'm horrible at golf like horrible I've only golfed a few times in my life and I signed up for a golf swing analysis um just like randomly it's $125 for 60 minutes and so I don't know what these what they're charging but I already feel like uncomfortable like going and some like random person is going to analyze my crappy golf swing uh and I have to go and like drive there and park and walk and like doing it out of the comfort of your own home like that's for like $20 like I would do that all day totally yeah yeah that and yeah exactly and then the app is just Al like so much more scalable than uh and a bunch of coaches um that you can get some good content ideas from Tik Tok itself too if you just search golf swing like there's people that already sort of make this content where they analyze the the angles you know famous golfers swings and another app that I like in the space is uh KO uh their uh MMA app so they help you train um uh like boxing and mixed martial arts so if you go to you know if you search KO watch some of these videos it's basically a product demo you know there's lessons in the app but then there's also this like wireframe Skeleton thing I really like this concept I think this could be applied to so many other apps like tennis golf pickle ball if you draw this wireframe over people and you kind of use that to analyze their movements um it works really well on Tik Tok because it looks it looks really cool it it's like visually has this kind of wow factor and you know the the content already sort of has this uh this analysis in the organic videos it would be so easy to plug in an app on this and just have a little screen recording in the corner that shows the interface of uh the app analyzing the golf swing um it's a super easy product integration um I like it I I mean I like it because I mean it works it's you know T tennis pickle ball like what are other like skiing you know I'm just trying to think of like what are high value like what are what are sports that people the liftime value of a customer is high as well as that they're interested in analysis of of how you know of how they uh how they swing or play or whatever there's actually I forget the name of it but there's a camera that does this and it's specifically designed for tennis players and pickleball players have you heard about this I have a friend who does it he he like he sets it up every every time we play tennis he like puts it on the fence and then the camera and I think there's an app component too so it's the camera and the app together toally camera I don't know if the camera's completely necessary though I feel like GPT vision is like good enough to kind of yeah like the the camera on the iPhone is pretty damn good yeah and you can just use the apis like the GPT this is Super Fresh by the way like GPT Vision um just came out this year and you know all the other llm companies are building better and better versions of the uh the AI Vision stuff so the opportunity is very fresh like there's not that many uh competitors in the space yet um one more um uh High LTV Niche is is poker um I still have not seen a really really good um like well monetized poker app but when you think about it poker players are probably the best customer that you can have when it comes to like sports and and you know games and um people who would use apps um I mean typically these a lot of these poker videos and like content gets monetized via uh gambling sites because obviously they make a lot of money too but you could build uh you know an app that helps poker players analyze their their hand history like analyze the um the strategies did I make a mistake here or there um you could even position it more towards beginners and show them you know tips on um hey here's what you did this hand here's something that you might want to do um next hand um and sort of have an educational component similar to similar to KO um but a lot of these poker videos are unmonetized so just or at least under monetized like they either sell a a poker course where they say here here's how they like learn poker um or they're sponsored by gambling um websites but you could reach out to all these poker poker creators and uh integrate the app into the into the gameplay videos like for example this video has like 990,000 views it's like biggest tip for poker players oh it clicked the wrong one this one how to play the straddle and it's just I think the person's probably talking voice over so for here he calls but imagine if you just put a little interface right here that said okay let's look at you know what are my what are my pod odds like what are my right um you know uh what What's the uh range what's my range right now like how should I uh bet here should I should I check um you could put the app interface right there just flash it for two seconds and then continue on with the video and then people in the comments are going to be like oh what was that app like how did you do that and then you can just reply and people read the Tik Tok comments so you're gonna get a lot of people getting downloads from that and there's tons of accounts that just post these poker videos every day and they're completely unmonetized um so this is a I think it's a big opportunity when I hear you talk I just I'm I let's I was okay I'll tell you a little bit I had coffee with someone this morning who he he's a Founder he sold his last company for like $180 million and he was kind of complaining to me that it's so hard to stand out now it's so hard to come up with ideas for stuff and I was like dude what are you smoking like what are you smoking like there's the amount of opportunity right now like and these aren't even like you know I call them super niches which is like a niche of a niche these are like large categories that you're you're talking about that's true yeah you could get even M more micro with these but I just like Tik Tok is just yeah like I said said it's mostly monetized through e-commerce and there's just not that many people that have uh figured out this content yet um I like one thing one thing that I've noticed is that um people also get stuck on like influencer marketing because everyone views influencer marketing through um the lens of like the Instagram era which was an influencer you know you pay an influencer they have millions of followers and you know people the the theory was that oh people follow people not Brands and I think that's true I think influencers you access as a niche audience but Tik Tok is is different it's different because people watch content on the for you page they don't watch content from people that they actually follow like if you scroll through your for you page 95% of the content is brand new accounts you've never seen before so because of that you can't do influencer Marketing in the same way um with influencer marketing your the creators that you hire are actually three different roles it's like they're an actor which most people think about but then they're also a director they're creating the video a lot of times you give them a brief but best practice is usually hey you give you know get creative freedom and then they're also they have a built-in audience um but this the director portion is often a a huge uh a huge um uh mistake uh that a lot of Brands make is that they either give too much creative freedom or not enough creative freedom if you give too much then the influencers is just going to make whatever video they want and not sell the product uh because influencers don't like selling stuff they don't like the feeling of selling out or you know Shilling things so they they're artists like a lot of influencers they feel like artists they don't want to Shield products and feel like a sellout but then on the other hand if you're over prescriptive and you say okay you actually have to mention these here's the brand guidelines then the video is not going to get any views because it it just it'll feel like an ad and this happens a lot so because the the Tik Tok algorithm is for you page-based it's all about making good content so you can skip you can skip the audience part so if you find if you cut out the director role and the audience role you can now hire creators just as actors like just to be the talent in the video so they can have zero followers so when people say like oh influencers are overpriced this is my response like because you don't have to find people who have big audiences you just have to find people that know how to make good videos and if they have a thousand followers or 10,000 followers they can just make a new brand account and make content on there so for example if you look up tabs tabs chocolate this is their strategy they just make all these brand accounts and they hire a creator for each one um same thing with uh all these other apps that I'm mentioning like the um um what's what was the uh what was that app where people did it's like a widget on your phone and then you can listen to the music oh uh airbuds is that what you're talking about yes so the airbuds does the same thing it's like Lila airbuds Stacy airbuds will airbuds so all of all of these accounts they're new they're brand new accounts that they found the Creator and then they had them create a new account so this was this is very cheap to to do they just found small creators and then have them make new accounts um yeah so I I think it's still underpriced um I think if you do traditional influencer marketing it's definitely going to be uh a little bit expensive um especially if you go after influencers with big follower accounts um but I think there's still lots of ways to do Tik Tok in a very underpriced way I agree especially es you know like I like I we've both been saying especially if you are creating digital products I see you have locks Club as an example here yeah yeah is great yeah they're they're a member of my community they are I really like their content strategy they do um so locks Club is a exclusive uh dating app for uh Jewish people with very high standards so it's sort of like Rya but um more Niche down and they're starting to do this content Series where it's like how to find a nice Jewish boy in NYC these are like Jewish uh inside jokes yeah yeah so like if you find someone like this who knows the culture knows you know how to talk to the target audience Um this can go viral on a brand new count account as well so I was just talking to them uh to the founder uh this week and like I noticed that this video was the most popular out of the most recent ones it's like 400,000 views so they could create a whole new account just dedicated to this type of like Street content um so when when you find a for format that's working and scalable does it make sense to create new accounts for it is that what you're saying yeah yeah it does yeah because the algorithm Works in a way where um if you think about like Tik Tok wants if if content is good Tik Tok wants to show it to the right people like it's in their best interest to get more watch time so if they're if they know that a certain account has a lot of uh so for example if this like if this reached XYZ audience then now Tik Tock or Instagram reals they know that this account serve like this content did well with this audience um so if you make another video that looks similar has the same face the same you know format then it'll be a lot easier for it to for the algorithm to serve that content to the same audience again um so if you see um if we go back to the colostrum videos this account figured out that the food content works so they just Spam the same thing every day um so the algorithm knows and expects what audience to serve it to it just helps with the algorithm if you put too many faces in a single account um then it'll hurt your your reach the algorithm kind of gets confused like who do I who do I show this to um so it's it's not so much about making the whole page look aesthetic it's more because people don't really look at the page anyway it's more like optimizing it for the algorithm and making sure it knows who to serve the content to that's good to know you had uh one last thing I want to talk about on your list I think it was something to do with cult movements what do you mean by that so one of the biggest names in this space is uh Blake Anderson so Blake did uh the looks maxing app uh called umax basically there's this movement um of basically men who want to improve their physical appearance it's pretty it's pretty simple but it does go very deep because when you think about like what are like what are people motivated it's like people want to look good there's a lot of insecurities attached to um physical appearance um and especially with young men these days I think there's a lot of challenges with dating and you know uh I mean teenagers will will always be insecure about something so um there's this app called umax and it scans your face so it has this interface so this this app it scans your face and then it shows you your potential and all the scores about you and then uh and then it you know gives you tips on how to improve your jawline how to fix your skin care your hair you know these various things about your about your face um and this app makes a lot of money um I don't remember what the revenue is but it's several million a year um and they mostly used Tik Tok as their distribution but it's really interesting because looks maxing I don't know if everyone knows this but looksmaxing is sort of a a really deep internet movement like it came from sort of these red pill inel kind of Reddit communities from several years ago and it was sort of this very Niche thing and now it's gone mainstream but it has deep roots in like people really believe like you know you need it's almost an ideology it's like you need to be maximizing your physical appearance like you know looks maxing um so they like umax was one of the first apps that capitalized on this movement um so if you if you think about uh you know other movements um that haven't really that don't really have a product attached to them yet I think that's sort of the10 million uh business uh that can be started in all kinds of niches um another one is well and a in a framework I'm not gonna like I If I had the idea I would build it um but I can give a framework for like finding these ideas uh which is you know like what do what do people want in general in life it's it's health wealth and relationships and this this one is relationships it's like you improve your physical appearance sort of Health in a way but it it it does have a lot to do with you know Finding finding love and dating and things like that um and I guess self-improvement uh is is pretty Health as well but if you think about health wealth relationships those are the three main things that people want um what are the movements that can be built around that wealth obviously there's lots of Cults related to wealth like uh I don't know if you know crayo this is a app I think they have more than five million annual revenue right now they basically partnered with this guy and a couple of other um YouTubers and Tik tokers who teach teenagers how to make money on Tik Tok and YouTube shorts and they show them basically like uh you know find these streamers Clips uh clip up the videos and then Mass post them on Tik Tok and YouTube shorts and then they sell a course so they monetize by selling a course on how to do it it's like a you know several thousand dollar course but then you know so they have this existing audience of all these people trying to make more money and then uh Arab Khan is the guy who started this SAS he just created uh crayo which basically produc tizes the course so instead of teaching a course on how to make these videos you just make the videos with the software in a more automated way so you if you've seen these like Reddit Minecraft Parkour videos that get Mass posted on YouTube um now instead of promoting his course Daniel gets to promote uh the software instead this's another sort of the cult of money I guess you could you could think of it um yeah Cult of young money too right like it's they could have gone after everyone but they focused on really teenagers I guess like them too you know like people who look like Daniel like young I you know so interesting I think you know what's interesting to me there is um it's it's cult-like I'm always a believer in you know the best businesses are cult-like and then someone's listening to this and being like well that's spammy or sleazy it's like well no like apple scaled as a cult-like business there's plenty of reputable businesses the best businesses in fact are always cold-based cult-like so um I think that uh that that's that that comes to mind um that's how the other thing I just have yeah yeah I was just gonna say the other thing I just have to say is your product has to be good Baseline though you know what I mean like just because you have great distribution if you're sending people to a product um that isn't high quality and I'm not talking about crayo I'm just talking about in general looks maxing any of the stuff we're talking about you you know the Baseline is the product needs to resonate so before you get millions of people I guess this is a champagne problem but before you get millions of people to try your app make sure that it isn't a leaky product that it's retaining um that there's some product L growth get those metrics right and then layer on a lot of the stuff that we talked about today totally yeah I would say like the and it and it'll help you it'll help your marketing too because once you figure out okay I get a thousand downloads and this many people paid and then here's how many actually retained and stayed for another month because they valued the prod product now you can see your LTV and your CAC and then you can spend more on marketing and you can make your marketing better if you know your product is good so um I think if you don't know that your product is good and you're spending all this money on marketing then yeah you have a leaky bucket you don't want uh a product that's not retentive then you're getting then then it's basically an e-commerce product all over again because you're just selling a product once that's right in the funnel exactly the point of is that it's scalable and it's retentive right okay if you made it this far in the in the episode I don't know about you all but I'm I'm obsessed with Joseph I think he needs to come back on so um like comment subscribe let's get this video to go viral um because I think that yeah you know you're criminally underf followed and and and I'd I'd love to get you more well known and I think that there's just so many nuggets of insight in this video that I think is is really going to you know help people avoid a lot of pain in actually building out their ideas so I thank you for that Joseph where could people get to know you and and some of the stuff that you're working on uh you can find me on Twitter um I post content about the latest trends I'm seeing in Tik Tok and consumer apps and I also have a community of consumer app founders where we discuss the latest tactics so uh check out my check my Twitter check his Twitter all right my man I'll uh I'll see you around and uh you know this has been real catch you later dude it's been great thanks Greg [Music]

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
this episode was crazy it was with John cougan and he had some of the biggest ideas I've heard all year the these moonshot companies like it's either going to be like a billion dollar business or you're gonna have literally lit a billion dollars of other people with money on fire it just seems like the bar to colonizing the Moon is like orders of magnitude lower than than than Mars and so the question is like who's going to build this like I think that there will be a startup that will take one of these humanoid robots give it an AR-15 like a machine gun or a rifle and I said oh and then they're going to raise like a $500 million seed round this isn't your normal startup ideas podcast episode this isn't going to be about how you can create a startup that makes a million dollars next year it's all about Big Ideas I think it's going to expand your mind I think you're going to enjoy it you will enjoy it enjoy the [Music] episode John cougan on the Pod Mr Big Ideas that's what I'm gonna call you H not that big of ideas but uh there's a there's a you know fine line between big idea and just hot take [ __ ] post and I and I think today we're gonna hit some of them that are you know complete meme companies some of them that maybe could be good it's going to be on the listener and the viewer to decide which of these ideas are actually good and which are purely viral fodder for the media all right so where do we start let's start with cyber security for artificial intelligence companies so if you have been following AI there's been this interesting development obviously a lot lot of people right now are thinking about how can I use AI to build a new app or a new company and the obvious thing would be putting AI in your cyber security layer so there's an incident report that goes out hey uh we we we got this uh user alert that someone is trying to log in like 10,000 times with different passwords uh we should probably block them now obviously you could you could have an AI you know intermediate that intermediate that interaction such that that's handled automatically instead of pinging your so your poor software developer at 2 am. he has to get up check his pager and say oh yeah we should block that person we're getting we're getting dosed by Russia let's let's turn them off let's block that IP address obviously a lot of people have thought about implementing artificial intelligence in part of the cyber security stack in order to beef up the existing cyber security solutions for all sorts of companies everything from Bank of America to Boeing to you know United Airlines they all need cyber security and every cyber security company knows AI can make their job easier so they're implementing this what I'm talking about is doing the flip side building a cyber secur firm that's specifically designed to secure the now highest value digital Assets in the world maybe next to crypto and Bitcoin like if there's a whole bunch of Bitcoin that's really valuable but other than that the next most valuable digital asset has to be the weights to these large language models and so so open AI it's rumored that they spent around $500 million training gp4 now all of those weights like once the gpus go off and train the model it all gets boiled down into these weights it's just numbers in a file essentially it's in a very large database but you know you could steal this and there's a lot of fearmongering and conspiracy theories in Silicon Valley right now to the effect that oh China has already stolen the weights to gp4 maybe they already have stolen the weights to GPT 5 who knows if it's real I actually think most of these labs are pretty secure but it goes without saying that these are going to be increasingly valuable targets for hackers to break into and steal and so figuring out how to protect a digital asset like its Fort Knox seems like something that's going to be a new and ongoing challenge for the artificial intelligence industry broadly now this is different from in past in past generations of tech because if you stole the codebase to Facebook and you were like okay I have all the code to Facebook I'm gonna launch Facebook to.com well you don't have any of the users people aren't going to your website it's not valuable but with the large language model weights once you get the model you can run that anywhere you can stick that anywhere you can wrap that into your own product and all of a sudden you're not paying open AI or anthropic if you're able to steal the weights and so these firms are going to need top tier cybercity they already do a lot of these guys they they go to Defcon they talk to all the hackers they have huge huge uh you know resources allocated to this but it's just going to become an ongoing problem and I think that there might be a new opportunity to figure out to build a new um a new company around securing these extremely extremely valuable digital assets which are the the the AI models and so um I think that there's a in in many ways this is you know it's not an entirely novel problem but if you look at what happened in crypto for a long time there were there were kind of two things that were really valuable there was like Bitcoin which was kind of like sticking around forever and then there was this company called chainalysis did you ever see this so chainalysis was a company that they didn't have a token it wasn't a crypto company they did the analysis to find like the fraudsters and they were like super Downstream of the actual like cryptocurrency but that company even when you talk to the most DieHard crypto hater they'd be like oh well yeah CH analysis is probably like a good company because their cash flow is like independent of the underlying token prices because they're just getting paid to hunt down the criminals and so I think there's something there's something interesting and and uncorrelated about doing cyber security for artificial intelligence companies where you could be index to the growth of artificial intelligence without directly needing you know some next Benchmark to hit and and and you're not going to be in a situation where oh all of a sudden you know oh you got obsolet by you know a uh like like a current company um so anyway that's my first take shh don't tell anyone but I've got 30 plus startup ideas that could make you millions and I'm giving them away for free these aren't just random guesses they're validated Concepts from entrepreneurs who built $ hundred million plus businesses I've compiled them into a one simple database compiled from hundreds of conversations I've had on my podcast but the main thing is most of these ideas don't need a single investor some cost nothing to start I'm pretty much handing you a cheat cheat the idea bank is your startup shortcut just click below to get access your next cash flowing business is waiting for you the cyber security for AI companies Greg what do you think about it so I like the idea but where my mind goes to is what does an insurance company for AI look like right um I I actually never thought about the insurance business until I was watching Warren Buffett at the Berkshire hathway annual meeting and he said something that stuck with me which is insurance is a great business and someone's like why and he goes you get paid today for something that might not happen tomorrow that's great yeah I thought that was a really good way of putting it so I wonder you know using the Fort Knox analogy of gold um like if I'm trying to like MVP this maybe an MVP is um you just get in the insurance business for for and and and then eventually you sort of evolve into what you're talking about yeah you know with the this is this is somewhat related but with the generative AI that's kind of dominating the performance ad market right now um you know AI generated ads ads generally across Facebook are already being optimized and chosen through artificial intelligence but increasingly the the text will be uh generated on the Fly per user and a brand will just kind of show up with like hey here's my product do your best to portray it in the great light and Facebook is going to wind up generating video imagery everything for your brand ultimately um it's generative AI is really going to transform digital advertising but a lot of the big companies and big brands are super nervous about turning their brand over to a generative AI model that is known to have flaws and get things wrong occasionally and so for those folks like the small and medium businesses the smbs they will just go for it because it doesn't matter if they if their brand gets you know misconstrued in some AI hallucination because they just need performance they just need to grow the top line but for a really established brand they don't want to take that risk so maybe you could wedge in somewhere there like sell to the CMO of cocacola and say hey we know that you're going to be using generative AI tools if there is some sort of backlash to a a generative AI campaign that you run we will foot the bill to do all the brand correction to get you back on track um that that could be interesting because those those big brands are going to be like the last ones they're going to be the laggards in terms of adopting this technology 100 per. yeah you know when I hear an idea like you have here it's like this to me is I'm almost certain that this will exist and there'll be a big company but I'm just I always just think about like okay what is the what are the what are the wedges like what are the hundred wedges and like starting to write that down on a list and then how do you prioritize the wedge such that who you know me or whoever's listening is best suited to do that wedge um and also it's easy easyish to to to build that wedge yeah I mean with with this particular idea like obviously you need you know like Rock Solid cyber security chops in terms of the actual technical skill of your team and then you also need insane B2B connections to be able to go and sell this so it's not for everyone this is not something like you know some College Dropout kids going to build in their free time maybe they will maybe they'll be able to put it together but you know I I would assume that this is going to be something that comes out of like the current industry somebody that uh somebody that already has a lot of Rapport and and connections and can uh really like know exactly what product to build immediately 100% you've got a few ideas so we got a lot to talk about yeah let's do number two what was number two oh number two was the moonshot so I have thought for a long time I mean I want to go to the Moon I think most people want to go to the Moon my son certainly wants to go to the moon like every kid wants to go to the moon but there's always a question of like how do we actually get there we've been there 1969 you know that's a long time ago at this point and we're going back so SpaceX is going to have the capacity to go to the moon and put humans there but Elon is has never been really focused on the moon he's super focused on getting to Mars he wants to make humanity interplanetary and the and the problem with Mars is that there's only a small window of time when you can actually launch a mission from Earth to Mars because the the planets if they're on the opposite side of the of the solar system like it would just take forever to get there so you need to wait for them to kind of line up like next to each other and and that only happens every like two and a half maybe three years and and so there's going to be this very slow iteration where when the next transfer window comes up SpaceX is going to definitely try and launch a rocket to get there but it'll probably just be like robots and then the next one they're going to launch like 10 Rockets during that window because they're gonna have like three years so it's not like going to low earth orbit where they can just launch a new rocket every single day like they're doing now for the Starling satellites um so it's gonna be it's going to be a longer process but I really think that just if we're g to get to Mars Humanity needs to start getting their reps in on the moon and the beauty of the moon is that a it's really close you can always get to it and you can always get back from it because if you plant an like an emergency escape pod on the moon as long as you're on the earth facing side the Moon is locked in orbit so it always faces Earth so it's never it's never the situation that you're like oh my Escape pod is pointing at the Sun and it's not pointing at Earth like it's always pointing at Earth so worst case scenario you know like uh this is kind of silly but like sci-fi scenario like there's a crack in my spacit helmet you could literally just dive into your Escape pod smash the big red button and it shoots you back to Earth and you're back in the Pacific Ocean in like you know a couple hours or I don't know how long it takes but like you know not long guaranteed to be there now worst case scenario like you land in North Korea or something but for the most part like at least you're back on Earth um and maybe there's a little bit of steering that can try and get you to somewhere that's a little bit friendlier but it just seems like the bar to colonizing the Moon is like orders of magnitude lower than than than Mars and so the question is like who's going to build this like 20ish 10 10 to 20 years ago there was a guy named bar Barney pel who was made a lot of money in the doom boom and started a company called Moon Express that was kind of targeting this idea of like let's go do stuff on the moon and I think he was just a little bit too early he was really well funded really talented guy obviously but he couldn't get it done but now there's this interesting period where SpaceX will have the capacity and we will know the price and there's been a number of companies that have gotten up and running on the basis of spacex's falling launch cost to to low earth orbit so there's two examples that I think of one is vaarda um they do drug Manufacturing in space so uh in low earth orbit there's no gravity and so if you're trying to make a drug and it's crystalizing if you can turn off the gravity that can produce higher yields and better drugs essentially so it's a pharmaceutical play but leveraging space SpaceX and it would be impossible without SpaceX and the same thing goes for uh impulse impulse Space by Tom Mueller the first employee at SpaceX He is building a a company that boosts creating a boost vehicle that gets uh gets material from low earth orbit to geosynchronous orbit and so um that is another company that wouldn't exist without SpaceX and so I think there will be a series of these companies and for the really really big opportunities it's totally possible that SpaceX like takes it for their for themselves like SpaceX launches a lot of Internet satellites um but when the really big opportunity of starlink came about which is low earth orbit satellites and this mesh it was obviously going to be just way better performance you know you can now do Zoom calls or podcasts like on planes it's crazy uh and really anywhere uh they kind of took that for themselves so I wouldn't I wouldn't want to compete with SpaceX on that um but if I think about you know Moon tourism or some sort of like Moon mining operation or even just some you know Contracting uh organization that that puts assets on the moon for some other reason getting ju like what if your business is like we're just going to get food assets or air or water to the moon and we're just going to build that up so that if SpaceX wants to buy some of it we have it on the moon or NASA wants some of it we have it on the moon and that's what our business is and we're just really good at understanding the economics of of spacex's current cost to get a kilo to the moon and we are really good at just taking like if it costs a $100,000 a kilo or million dollars a kilo or it doesn't matter we have figured out what the right thing is to do right now and I don't know the sequence of events it might be you want to put a nuclear reactor there first or something or solar panel or I don't know robot who knows but figuring that out and then just being the company that just does that again and again and again uh just puts you in a really cool place and I just think like we might be it might be the right time we like we might be it it sounds crazy and it sounds early but at the same time like The emis mission's Happening humans are gonna be on the moon and I think when that happens and we see like we're gonna see like HD video of humans walking on the moon in like a couple years and that's gonna be crazy because like all we have is the really grainy footage from the 60s that like No One Believes anymore and everyone thinks it's a conspiracy theory and like it's going to happen again and it's going to be undeniable because it's gonna be like live streamed and there and there's going to be people on the moon I'm sure people will be like it's fake uh it's not not real but it will be real and most people will like wake up and then I think the financial Community will wake up Engineers will wake up everyone will wake up and say like I want to be doing stuff on the moon just like you know five six years ago people or even 10 years ago people were like well the SpaceX thing is working now like I want to do something in lowth orbit and whether that's a satellite or imagery Planet Labs Planet Labs just takes photos of the Earth constantly and then they can sell that data to all sorts of different resources like hedge funds or weather companies there's a whole bunch of things that are valuable there um the question is like what is the planet Labs of the moon what is the vaa of the Moon uh I think that that becomes a really really interesting question and so I I don't really have a firm conception but I just think like now is the time to start thinking God this is like this is why I brought you on you know when when we do this show we have a lot of ideas around you know $1 million a year 10 million $100 million a year moonshots talking about the Moon isn't you know in our normal repertoire um and it just reminds me of like it's important to have people like you in in in it's important to have people listen to people like you because um if you listen to like the here's an idea to build like a quick AI app to make you a million dollars you get sucked into that world and that might be thinking too small it might be it just depends on like who you are and what you want to be doing with your life like there's there's it's totally valid to be like I want to build a lifestyle business or I want to build a big business or I want to build something really slow or you know I want to have full control and not rais like all these things are valid I just think like you know for the right person out there there's probably someone who's like yeah you know what I have been obsessed with the moon when I was five years old and I have some skills that are relevant here like why don't I just go after this and then I can always build a million business later uh you know but yeah I mean these moonshot companies like it's either going to be like a billion dollar business or you're going to have literally lit a billion dollars of other people with money on fire and and it's gonna be a disaster hopefully it's not like a fraud and you actually just spent it on important things and it just like didn't go well which happens all the time and that's fine everyone signs up for that but uh but yeah I mean um I do think that there are lots of people who who are who like they lose a little bit of that you know childlike wonder and if you're childhood was all about you know doing something really ambitious or like at least give it a shot you know like why why not try and get the first thing done build the pitch deck raise the money go hire some people figure out the next thing I mean a lot of people are doing this like post liquidity like there's there's the the Robin Hood the co-founder of Robin Hood the trading app became very very wealthy I mean that's a multi-billion Dollar business and he and he's always obsessed with space and so he's doing solar panels in space and then uh capturing the energy and then beaming it down to earth with a laser now I haven't looked into the numbers I have no idea if this will work it it sounds crazy to me who knows but like it's super cool and I'm glad he's doing that instead of just like buying another yacht or something you know like go for it like do something cool why not totally and that's why I wanted to bring you on like I brought you on because some people are going to be listening to this and be like this guy is crazy and and some people are going to be like I need more people like John in my life either you know just like listening to you or getting to know you because I think um it helps people kind of figure out what they want to how they want to spend their time um and it's good to have diverse sort of um people to you know what yeah yeah diers from a thinking perspective you know yeah yeah yeah no I get you uh well the next one is a little bit more tactical and a little bit less of a moonshot I think that this could be it'd be hard to make this next one a true lifestyle business uh because it is pretty Capital intensive but I do think that there's a way to make to drisk this to the point where you're pretty much guaranteed to make money um and so so I'll I'll walk through it and then I'll give some examples of other companies that I think kind of fit into this this narrative um so one common problem that um I was actually just talking to a kid uh who's younger who said like his parents really didn't want him to become an iPad kid and so they got him this locked down Kindle Fire that was just for reading ebooks but then he learned how to code and learned how to hack it so that he could play Clash of Clans on it and it was just a very funny story and it actually taught him how to code and now he's like a software developer and a founder and it was like a great experience um instead of just having the the dopamine fed straight into him but I think that it's a very common theme that everyone feels addicted to their phones um but adults really can't go back to the dumb phone it's just too much of a shift and so a lot of the like dumb phone companies haven't done all that well but I think that there's a bigger opportunity to go after uh the kids phone quick ad break let me tell you about a business I invested in it's called boring marketing.com so a few years ago I met this group of people that were some of the best SEO experts in the world they were behind getting some of the biggest companies found on Google and the secret sauce is they've got a set of technology and AI that could help you outrank your competition so for my own businesses I wanted that I didn't want to have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I didn't want to depend on ads to drive customers to my businesses I wanted to rank high in Google that's why I like SEO and that's why I use boring marketing.com and that's why I invested in it they're so confident in their approach that they offer a 30-day Sprint with 100% money back guarantee who does that nowadays so check it out highly recommend boring marketing.com and so I was I was kind of jokingly call this like you know the iPhone what comes after I well it's j and then it's k k phone maybe it's the kids phone but then you could uh you know broaden it out but when I when I heard the reviews of a lot of these AI Hardware companies like the Humane AI pin or or the rabbit R1 um a lot of the reviews kept coming back to the fact that these you know there were a lot of problems like they weren't as full featured for like a power user who wants like the right answer every single time but for as a cute little device for a kid to carry around I love the idea of a rabbit R1 going into you know a six-year-old's hands and it's like what does it need to do well it needs to like take a picture of a flower and tell the kid what flower that is and if it gets it wrong like it's not that big of a deal because like they still learned about some flower or some animal and and then it needs to be able to like you know make an emergency call to to to family let the family know where the kid is but it doesn't need to be able to install Clash of Clans or fortnite or Minecraft or any of this stuff uh it just needs to do like a few basic things maybe it could be a watch form factor maybe it's a tablet thing maybe it's another device but you're just deliberately curtailing the dopamine fueled infinite scroll apps and not allowing those onto the platform and I think parents would buy this earlier I think parents will eventually be beaten down by teenagers and just wind up buying iPhones but for the middle schoolers I think a lot of parents would be happy to buy something that's like you know decent quality kind of ruggedized kind of fun cool style doesn't look like an Apple product doesn't look like a status symbol couple hundred bucks basic features and it's something that can maybe help the kid with homework or questions or learn about the world keep them connected a little bit but not overwhelm them with the dopamine fueled apps and I think that for these Hardware companies they they always run into this problem where I mean this was case study with Humane where it's X Apple people and so all their investors are like you have to beat apple and it's like Apple's a multi-trillion dollar company like you have to full send it at that point and so they made a lot of decisions that only make sense if you are fundamentally rejecting the idea that Apple just has a monopoly on a lot of things in the mobile device world and so the Humane AI pin it had a separate phone number it wouldn't it wouldn't interact with your phone because they were like oh well we don't want to link into the phone because then Apple will have control over us we want to make the new platform and you see this a lot with like the Oculus device that Zuck been working on like it's always kind of clunky because it's like wait wh why doesn't this just pair with my iPhone because like my iPhone's great but it's like yeah he can't because he needs to go to war with apple like he does not want to lose and so but but for this it wouldn't really matter if it like was set up through the the the parents phone or whatever because you're you're not trying to do this crazy thing where like you need to get the 30% App Store fee and you need to own the the the relationship forever and you also need the the the device metrics and you need the tracking in the ads Network and you need all these things like because maybe with this one you're not immediately targeting a trillion dollar business you're just thinking like okay I'm going to put this on Instagram advertise it to parents and every time that there's like a new school year right at summer and maybe Christmas I'm doing a big push and yeah I'm gonna sell like a 100,000 units for a hundred bucks each or something that's $10 million like this is a pretty sizable business but it's not going to be hyperscale and then and then over time maybe you do iterations maybe you add features and maybe this does turn out to be a way to attack apple and really take part of their market share because maybe eventually people do get sick of the the crazy phones with all the addictive apps and stuff but I don't think you need to have that happen in order to be successful so you don't need to raise quite as much money you don't need to go quite as crazy and I think you can constantly be counterposed against apple with like really quirky designs just stuff that completely breaks their design language where if they tried to launch something like what you're making it would be very weird and antithetical to their brand they've done this before with a with the tile app which was a little tracker a little Bluetooth tracker that you put on your keys that business was doing phenomenally because everyone no one wants to lose their keys but the problem was is that then Apple saw it and they were like oh we want that money and so they launched the air tag and the tile is like this Square white it looks like an Apple product and so the air tag is circular and white it looks like an Apple product and so all the tile customers just moved over immediately the same thing happened with the pebble watch it was it was designed with like an Apple brand language so it's very easy to just like be like well I'll just get an Apple watch um but if you if you design something that is is explicitly like anti-apple from the ground up they're going to have a harder time being like well actually the Apple brand is like Sleek titanium and it's also like quirky pink plastic with a bunch of rugged eyes stuff on it like it'll be a little bit harder for them to make that pitch and then they're also never going to be in a situation where they where Apple says hey we're launching device and we deliberately nerfed it so it doesn't have an app store and you can't install Tik Tok or Roblox like they're just never going to do that and so you have this like kind of counterposition value prop where where sure you might not be able to ever get that big and win over you know the the business guy who's going to buy the latest iPhone every year but you but you don't you're not in a category where Apple's gonna come and just destroy your business one year um so I think that there's something there that's like an interesting tidy business where you could just create like a lot of delight and you have a lot of room to play and experiment and look if if some of the features are a little rough around the edges or a little wonky as long as they're safe and they're not putting the Kid In Harm's Way it's really not that big of a deal if you know it's it's misc Mis categorizing a dog and a cat or something but as long as it's not showing them something offensive so I think that's I I think that's like a really fun place to play and I think it's underexplored and I think that increasingly you know there are more and more Millennials who are Tech consumers some of them are prosumers like you know you and I we have like professional cameras and professional microphones and stuff like we know how to buy like you know electronics at a higher tier and a lot of Millennials have kids now and so they're thinking about the same thing it's not the boomer generation where you need to really do all this education it's pretty easy to sell a millennial on that the problem is that if you sell it and the millennial is the end user they're going to be really really rigorous and be like are there any problems very similar to uh to starting a company that targets uh animal owners so like dog food companies have been one of the few categories in direct consumer that have done fantastically and the reason is because your dog doesn't tell you if they're sick of their food like if if you start a human food company the human will be like you know what I'm sick of that particular brand of beef jerky I'm trying something new but the dog will eat the same dog food for 10 years and so the churn is just super low and and kids you know the kids will say oh you know I don't like this or whatever but there but it's a lower bar and so I think there's just more room to play more room to experiment it's fun I I I miss I fundamentally miss the era of gadgetry I remember when I was a kid there was uh Sharper Image and every year there was like a new Gadget and it was just like they were like oh this is like a vacuum cleaner that plays music or there's a Bluetooth stereo that goes in your shower like just random stuff and all of that's just been completely cannibalized by Apple and don't get me wrong wrong I love Apple products they're fantastic there's a reason why we all buy them but I love this I love this idea of getting back to an Era where a small company can tinker and create something that's novel and new but tactile and something you can unbox there's so it's so hard to buy presents for people at Christmas because I used to get people DVDs and books and music albums all that's digital what am I going to do hey you should like just download this on Spotify and watch that on Netflix like no I want to get you a physical thing but then if I start getting you like a kitchen gadget like a you know a quard or an air fryer it's like well then pretty soon you're you're called kitchen's filled with all this junk it's ridiculous so we need to get back to like the cool gadgets the unique things the opinionated hardware and I think this is just a really really fun and interesting place to play but what's your reaction dude so good this I this this is probably my favorite one I also think this particular idea like once you show traction via the Internet you do Instagram ads you start selling it you can go to a Verizon and they're looking for products like this yeah they want to sell you even sell this in the Apple Store like it's not that crazy totally so these retail uh these retail shops are looking for products like this um to me this is a no-brainer yeah I I really hope that I mean I I don't exactly know what the the funding arrangements are a lot of these uh New Generation Hardware AI compan is but I I would love to see one of them like discover this and pivot into it and be really successful I mean I want them all to be successful but it just feels like a lot of those launches you know they they came out MKBHD kind of trashed them no one really bought it return rates were kind of high but it was because the pitch was you know this is going to be on par with your iPhone and that's just that's just too tall of an order and I I think uh just just making it fun and Niche and unique like I love the fact that I have obviously the the phone on the camera is great but I I love getting camera gear still I like I like a Sony camera that's opinionated around this one little thing it only does this one thing really well uh and and I love that but but those niches are getting Slimmer and Slimmer as the phone just does more and more so uh I'd love to see some more stuff break through yeah and I think uh just one quick takeaway from that is people are thirsty for fun products and I think it's key word fun you know when app you know I love Apple too but Apple has become like minimalistic and just clean and modern and you know for your day-to-day stuff that that's what you want yep but when you're when you're in gift giving mode like you want fun and when you when you receive when you receive a gift like it's more fun to get a fun gift with with a fun opinion than something's just clean and modern yeah totally yeah I mean I think back to like the old the old Max that had the the colored clear PL plastic on the back what a crazy design that's so cool I I think that's kind of making a comeback Zuck announced uh some some glasses that were clear which is really cool that you could see the internals and I think Palmer luy's new company mod retro has a has a clear Game Boy design that's really cool um but yeah it's uh It's Tricky I I I it feels like we're on the cusp of of something breaking through but but it is tricky yeah so whatever it is you're building if it's this idea or not inject fun because it's what people want yeah and it's just it's differentiated like it's it's going to be hard to compete with apple on just like the clean perfect industrial design and people are going to nitpick that they're going to say oh the tolerances aren't that good well it's like yeah because like you didn't have the resources to like mill a unibody like aluminum thing like it's like insane or like what however they made this out of titanium like that's insane like have some fun with it do something weird and even if it's like bigger or or you know uh sacrifices on some sort of vector like battery life or durability or whatever like just be upfront about that and I think I think consumers will embrace it we have a few minutes for one last one I want you to talk about the tweet that you just did okay yeah so last night night as as we're recording this we're recording this on Friday last night Elon Musk uh presented a uh a Tesla update called we robot where he announced the Cyber cab which is their uh unsupervised full self-driving uh ride share Network and some new vehicles and there he also had a number of humanoid robots on display I think the working name is Optimus and there's been a number of these humanoid robotics companies uh there's a bit of a boom now I think everyone's expecting that a lot of the work that was done in large language models and chat GPT to kind of flow downward towards humanoid robots where you could just talk to a humanoid robot and tell it to go do your laundry and it'll just do it now at this moment no one's really broken through with a fully autonomous robot a lot of them are teleoperated meaning that there's literally a human in a suit kind of like doing the same action remotely and then the robots just ing them um but that works for plenty of things I mean this has been used for a long time teleoperation in in medicine and then also in like you know if there's a nuclear reactor you don't want to go in there but it's fine to have a remote Tech you know walk in and you know act as the robot or whatever uh SWAT teams and bomb defusal this is the classic teleoperation robot um but there's separately from the AI and humanoid robotics Trend there's also been a huge Trend in defense technology uh driven mostly by anderol and paler before that but there's just this trend that like defense Tech is cool the government and the military is cool again uh the end of History isn't happening and there's you know potentially great power competition is back on the menu I mean we see this with Ukraine and and uh and Russia and there there are very serious conflicts happening and so people are coming to the conclusion that yes we do need uh you know a serious revamp and and uh efficiency gains within our military and so there's been a lot of companies that have started with uh you know drones uh famously uh why combinator just had their first defense tech company it's a cruise missile company uh which is kind of crazy when you think about what YC has done historically been a lot of consumer apps you know Airbnb a lot of B2B SAS uh you know Gusto and Rippling and stripe came through here um but then now they're doing cruise missiles and a lot of people think that's funny and interesting I I think it's great I think they should be doing anything that's valuable um but my point was that uh I was predicting that within the next six months I think that there will be startup that will take one of these humanoid robots even if it's teleoperated give it an AR-15 like a machine gun or a rifle and and just do a demo of like what this would look like for just basically the Terminator basically a Terminator scenario and go massively viral be extremely controversial people will say is this bad they're the robots are going to kill us um but you know and and I said oh and then they're going to raise like a $500 million seed round uh maybe that's true maybe that's not that's kind of you know a joke but the idea is that is that we've seen so many of these like humanoid robots and AI startups uh we've seen a lot of people doing cruise missiles and like things that would have been controversial like 10 years ago and now uh all the planets are aligning to create basically the Terminator company um which would be you know completely controversial and like a lightning rod which could be very good for getting attention and breaking through if you're a new stter um now there's a question about like do we actually need this is this the right thing for a lot of use cases like no you don't want a humanoid robot you want a tank or you want a plane or something um but uh but for some maybe the teleoperation makes sense you know like we like why put a human at risk in you know like when we went in to get Osama Bin Laden we sent in Navy Seals they got in a helicopter it was a very dangerous Mission and if they could have been running that mission remotely from a you know a a warehouse and just doing T operation but doing everything that they did but it's just robots so even if they got shot nothing would happen basically you die and you just immediately respawn like Call of Duty that sounds like an improvement it sounds dystopian and scary in many ways but at the same time the like the the the progress Arrow of of the future might just move in this direction and it seems something seems like something that that you know if you really think deeply about like what will the world look like in 50 years clearly the technology it will be possible to build a humanoid robot that holds a gun and so why wouldn't it happen like what are the forces that would stop that from happening and if you can't think of any any good reasons why it wouldn't happen then well maybe we're on the path to it happening and maybe we got to Grapple with that and interestingly uh Boston Dynamics has actually somewhat explored this uh years ago so Boston Dynamics is the company that does those incredible viral videos with the the spot robot it looks like a dog and then the atlas robot that can do parkour and they've been working on this for decades and the company has changed hands a few times Google owned it at one point I think Hyundai bought it for a while and it's moved around but it's always been a company that wasn't particularly focused on Government Contracting and defense Contracting um but back in 2013 or 2012 2013 I was living with this hacker guy who went on their website and figured out how to scrape all the files from their website even the ones that weren't necessarily like fully public um like they were public but they just weren't like actually shown to people on the website they were just like hosted there and one of them was a a sketch artist of their humanoid robot holding a gun and so it was very clear that they had at least someone in their organization had at least like pitched it to the government and said like hey like we could maybe do this and then I think someone was like we're not doing that but um but they have this one uh humanoid robot called Petman and it was designed you got you got to pull up a video or image of this because it's crazy uh because they they the the the stated mission of pet man was to test the mobility of uh of equipment to prevent like gas attacks so imagine you need to wear like essentially a space suit on the battlefield to avoid like some terrible biological attack or some gas so it's a gas mask but it's also a bodysuit and and you make the suit and then you need to put it through its Paces so you literally like Paces like you need to have it be like yes we put this on a human and the human ran for a 100 miles and so we know it's not going to break after a 100 miles of usage and you could do stuff just like putting it in a washing machine just beat it up and see if it holds its like it doesn't break or get leaks but putting it on a humanoid robot and just having the robot walk there for you know 10 miles or 100 miles is a pretty good way to test this stuff and so that's what they were using that for but there was no reason I mean you see this thing and it's just super militarized and you just think like okay like this is where this going and every time that there's a Boston Dynamics video that drops everyone always says like these things are going to have guns on them eventually and some people have put guns on them and the corridor crew this wonderful YouTube channel has actually done like a CGI version where they had the Bost they call it boss Town Dynamics and they and they had a whole version of like training them with guns but um basically all of the all of the clues are pointing to this this happening and it just feels like someone's going to put the pieces together that the tech exists and this would be massively viral and controversial and get me a ton of attention which could be good or could be bad but I could at least harness it and so I think someone's gonna do it maybe they're listening right now so I got a lot of thoughts on this one one is not only do I think that could this be used in the military Navy Seals type things but it could also be used for security right like I was driving on my way to here um and it's a Jewish holiday I think today um or tomorrow actually and uh people were I noticed that I was just passing by a bunch of synagogues and they all had armed guards with guns I'm here in Florida yeah and so I would imagine that there's probably thousands of these places of worships you know mosques synagogues churches that unfortunately are you know have to hire security now hiring you know a guy with a a rifle or a girl with a rifle um that's probably expensive um I'd much rather hire a security robot y you know with an AR-15 so um I think uh I think this is this is another again one of those ideas is that it's not an if when and it's also one of those things where it's like who you know do I want to start this company no but like I hope you know someone will yeah it is interesting like like will it be an arm of Tesla like you know Elon is already the defense contractor with SpaceX but he hasn't he hasn't built like you know icbms even though he builds Rockets um or andal has a lot of capabilities and they build autonomous weapon systems now and so they could build something like this um but uh my my my feel was more my original take on Twitter was more just like The Vibes are coalescing around the idea that this will be something that people will talk about if it happens and all the pieces are there for the demo at least and yeah maybe it's teleoperated maybe it's a very Niche use case and honestly like yeah giving it a gun is probably not even the most valuable thing I mean still search and rescue just going into the nuclear reactor when it's melting down or you know going into the burning building like you know teleoperation for for you know the the the firefighter gets out of the truck and is like okay I'm gonna virtually I'm gonna put on my VR headset and the and the and the robots gonna walk in and rescue the kitten like that makes a ton of sense and maybe that's the first thing but yeah I mean it's we we we are coming to the era of like it is believable that there will be a robot with a gun somewhere in the world in the next couple decades and somebody's going to be building that and that's just interesting to think about like you know is it good is it bad there's a lot of things you could you could work through um there will be a lot of regulations and a lot of rules and you know what does the Geneva Convention say about it and I'm sure we'll have a big debate and there'll be lots of you know editorial pieces and op EDS but uh the tech is here the future now the future is now yep John this has been an absolute pleasure thanks for getting my creative juices flowing where could uh where could people get to know you a little bit better well I just started a new podcast called technology Brothers It's a weekly chat show with me and a friend we just talk about the news of the week very casual uh but very cinematic we're having a lot of fun with it and then I do have a YouTube channel just my name John kugan um and I put up video essays and documentaries about tech and business and uh and politics and all sorts of stuff so uh check that out and you can also follow me on X johnan beautiful all right my man I'll catch you later awesome I'll talk to you later bye bye [Music]

4) Pro tip: When building with AI, start simple and add features incrementally. This helps manage complexity and troubleshoot issues more easily. 

5) Bolt is democratizing web development:
• Non-devs are building full-stack apps
• Dramatically reduces time and cost compared to traditional development
• Enables rapid prototyping and iteration

6) The future of coding? It's about becoming an expert AI prompter:
• Understanding how to "drive" LLMs effectively
• Translating ideas into clear instructions
• Iterating on AI-generated code

7) Real-world example: A PM built a viral TikTok hooks app in 2 weeks for $50/month with Bolt. Traditional dev quote? $3-5k and months of work. That's 100x cost savings and 5-10x faster! 

8) Even YC startups are using Bolt to build landing pages, freeing up dev time for core product work. It's not just for side projects - it's changing how REAL businesses operate. 

9)  Want to try Bolt? Here's how:
• Head to bolt.new
• Type your idea in the input box
• Hit enter and watch the magic happen!

you've heard about it it's bolt people say it's the cursor AI killer I don't know about that but it is one of the best ways to get your idea to Market and I think for the first time ever we've had the founder of Bolt actually show how to use his product we've done it with the founder of repet now we're doing with the founder of Bolt you're not going to see this anywhere besides the startup ideas podcast so get ready by the end of this episode you will learn a lot about how to use bolt like a [Music] pro we've got Eric he's the founder of Stack Blitz which is the maker of Bolt and I think probably for the first time he's just going to actually build something live and and just share how to do it so thank you Eric for coming on yeah absolutely yeah I mean it's been I'm actually pretty stoked about this because um this is one of the the first times where I've actually had a minute to sit down and use the product in like in a meaningful stretch um you know I'm kind of like Chief bugfinder uh typically but yeah that's you know I just I kind of know how to how to poke and PR the thing to make it break or whatever but this this is going to be fun because like you know a lot of folks have been um you obviously you know leading up to the launch of B like a month ago um I used you I was using buol quite a bit to to build stuff and and I have been since but um but you this is you know like it's only been online a month so it's not uh you know we have a lot of you know things to work on and so I'm actually excited you know there like we'll likely run into some roadblocks here and it's going to be great because I'm gonna go back to the team be like all right let's go let's go make this smoother you know um but yeah I'm walking in completely unprepared with uh uh just you know I have a couple of ideas of things we could build but I might even be even better if uh Greg if there's some stuff that uh that's on your mind that that you think would be uh cool for us to build um just to just to prove that you know this is none of this is pre-planned absolutely and I'm actually happy that you're you're you're not prepared because I think people people are unprepared too you know when they're building anything so you're so that's the way I want you I want you raw totally yeah totally because and and that's 100% because I think right now especially as we're improving the product um hopefully there's like some tips and tricks as you know it's kind of one of the people on the stack putut side of this that understands how this thing is built um I might be able kind of share some of the I don't know just some some debugging uh tips and whatever um that at this point in time are going to be useful and then you know a couple weeks from now hopefully are not even needed because we it's just stuff's built into the product that makes it smooth you know so um yeah stok Stoke to build some stuff here dude you know how we met right you know how we met we met from you commented on one of my videos on one of my both videos with r oh right I forgot that yeah yeah yeah yeah I remember I remember I I yeah watched the the video did with Ras Nikki um and I was like this is sick um that's dude that's all hell yeah I'm I'm on the I'm on the channel oh my God I went from commenter to guest I wow full circle let's go this could be you you comment you could come on the show I love it hell yeah that is that is so that is so dope that sick cool all right let's let's get to building heck yeah um okay let me I guess I can share my screen here uh so Greg uh what do you uh what do you want to build you you have any ideas I have I have two ideas and I want you to pick okay okay one is uh a directory of some sort so I just think that directories we you know we've done tutorials on directories on the Pod before but directories are such a good way to get a bunch of SEO traffic and then you can evolve it into a product so I think a lot of people are interested in directories and want to build it and maybe both can help them that's one idea and two is just a micro sass app you know everyone here is interested in micras getting that Mr um any micras idea you have I'm totally open with okay game on um I you know I we can probably we might be able to build both of these and that that might be the ultimate uh the ultimate Showcase of like I guess why uh you know I why Bolt's been kind of a a sensation over the past month since we launched the thing um I like the directory idea that's a fantastic one so let's start there because I think that's conceptually probably even um uh you know easier to kind of get rolling with um so what what um you know I guess like you're you're you're like a domain expert on this stuff what would be like what's like a good example of like a directory like someone's like trying to like go and build something that uh like they're trying to you know get a certain type of audience to come and you know get some and they're landing on this I don't know like what would be a good example of something like that and like what would be our next steps not even just building but like maybe where would we go to get kind of to populate that you know that that directory is some initial stuff you know what I mean yeah I mean so there's been lots to talk about how product Hunt is you know there's a lot of issues with it and like what is product hun at the core it's a directory of products and it's a directory of products for Founders so you know could we build a directory where it just like the products of the day products of the week I dig okay so um let's make uh a directory of uh great products um what's what's our what's our angle here what how like is it uh are we kind of are We curating it for an audience other than you know kind of uh Builders or what what are you thinking I think I think like Indie hackers and Builders and Boot Shop Founders and you know they're looking for products to make their lives easier more productive and they want a trusted Source shh don't tell anyone but I've got 30 plus startup ideas that could make you millions and I'm giving them away for free these aren't just random guesses they're validated Concepts from entrepreneurs who built hundred million plus businesses I've compiled them into a one simple database compiled from hundreds of conversations I've had on my podcast but the main thing is most of these ideas don't need a single investor some cost nothing to start I'm pretty much handing you a cheat sheet the idea bank is your startup shortcut just click below to get access your next cash flowing business is waiting for you and uh you know it kind of you know may seem weird that I'm like kind of typing all this kind of verbatim in but you know it kind of actually helps to you know I found to just kind of describe you know almost at a spiritual level kind of like this is what I'm shooting for and you that's I almost start every every single prompt off I do with like you know here's like I made a personal website for myself I was like this is I want a website that just has the sort of like software developer Vibe and aesthetic to it and it like nailed it it just like made something you know but it's like that's like not a thing that's like a Vibe you know what I mean so this is like kind of kind of you want to like you know mix something that's like like if you can kind of capture Vibe well in a sentence and kind of you know capture okay the other things uh uh you know some some more tangible concrete stuff of like okay exactly how this should work so like I think the next part of this would basically be like okay so what in this directory are we looking for like one main page or we you know you might have well like you know what sort of stuff have you seen built that that's worked actually Greg for this I yeah I think it's it's one main page with like maybe it's the FI maybe we can add some constraints maybe it's the F five products that you need to have a look at today and then there's like a product page that you click into and like why do we want that is just because that's just another SEO optimized page and then why I think that this is like an actual business that someone can go and create by the way is you can you can eventually just do affiliate deals with the the products you're mentioning yep really great Point really great Point um and um cool I anything else you want to add just before before we just go go and send it we we can keep prompting is that yeah I'm it's interesting because like I'm I'm curious like why is is there is there too long of a prompt because when I'm prompting I'm doing like one or two lines and I'm seeing you kind of write more of a paragraph or two paragraphs we'll see I mean we'll see how it works it kind of depends right and so it's you know sometimes and and what what you know we'll see how this prompt works but sometimes I'll put a prompt in and it gives me something back I'm like this is like kind of so far off that I'm actually just going to go back to the B home page and start set a brand new prompt off right you when I'm in the chat you can like roll back and so you know I'll I'll use that often but especially with this when you're especially when you're kind of describing this first paragraph is like high level this is the target audience this is the you know high level what this product is and this is actually just kind of more like specifically here's the thing here's the functionality we want in it right um it tends to be pretty good because what it's actually G to go and do is uh well we'll see if it you know if it Ls up to what what you know I'm about to say but by by because we kind of gave it this sort of um you know high level almost like marketing instructions when it's actually punching out the name of this directory or like the descriptions it should do a pretty good job of like kind of conveying like hey like actually actually writing good marketing C right um you know which is if if you're making a product like this it's important to have you know good good ctas um so let's just send it let's see what this it makes um and um it'll start punching this thing out this is one one of the nice I mean just that's that's insane I mean the how fast you can just get this this is like a real Cod base right it's like mpm installed everything it's going and writing all the files and stuff um it's it's pretty wild uh how fast it it uh it can get to work I mean especially compared to like if you had to like build this like locally or whatever have you um but um yeah we'll give it a second you usually the first generation it's got to write every single file out you know um yeah we'll see we'll see what this thing brings back um one other thing that's kind of cool too is when you're writing prompts we had this uh down at the bottom here this little sparkly thing it's called The Prompt enhancer um so we actually whatever's in in the prompt that you've already written you can hit that and it'll actually uh you send that up to our our AI model and it'll uh in it with extra details and um you kind of help scaffold out a very specific prompt and and that way kind of it makes it a bit more deterministic what you're going to get back because right now we just like sent it we were like okay here's just like high level but you want to really make sure you're getting back something that that you know is going to have all the functionality you want or whatever have you um you know the prty answer effectively kind of expands what you've said um and uh uh will help you kind of make sure stuff works because so now We've ran into an error um this is unfortunately one of the errors that we don't automatically catch um and so where is this error coming from um oh I see okay I'm just going to tell it what the issue is it so this is something when errors happen right now like we're doing a better job like good a good number of stuff like we have a little thing that'll pop in say like fix errors when stuff like this happens basically you just like copy and paste the error into the chat and it'll actually go ahead and go in and um you know take a stab at actually solving the thing whatever have you um so let this thing take a take a crack at uh regenerating this file and I believe this error so this is as a developer I can kind of speak to what happened here the AI made a dumb mistake and it didn't uh it didn't escape this this little quote there so so that uh that didn't allow the uh the application to compile right I also noticed I also noticed in the code that it seems like the one of the images is an unsplash image which I think is royaltyfree can you talk more about that yeah yes so we've trained this thing to actually uh you just out of the box it'll it'll go and pull stuff from unsplash I think a couple other providers as well um which is great because it's like you don't have to pay any money for it um you know out of the box you get like you know something that that looks pretty good right um there you go so we've got this uh this directory here let G goe and make this thing a little little wider screen um there we go essential tools for Indie hackers um and like I said this and this is kind of like again we because we explained kind of the essence of hey who's the audience and and you know what are they try to do with this versus just hey here's a directory of products we have got something kind of it would have you know at if you kind of squint it it's like okay yeah there's a list of products but now the marketing of these things are actually like the actual copy um makes more sense right and um so I can click in and this is the the page you know for for this product right um so pretty cool so we've got our own our own directory site um and yeah I mean you know that's not not not the craziest most complicated thing in the world but I mean I don't know we've been doing this for five minutes or something not even even I don't know um totally pretty insane pretty insane so yeah so it's actually got images too attached to the thing so you can obviously swap those with your own that sort of thing but it's nice to actually have a visual of it okay so if we wanna now that we've seen it and we're like oh you know we want to change this and change that so let's like one thing I I think I want to change is I want it to be like vertically vertically listed I know instead of horizontal I also so I also want it to you know like on product end it's like product of the day number one number two number three number four number five I think like the gamification of this directory is really interesting maybe we allow people to like upload it or something I dig so like maybe like we advertise you know like have it kind of like show like the number one number two number three like um yeah so show in a very obvious way which products are number one number two number three Etc and let the user upvote um uh on products something like that yeah absolutely okay let's see what this and then from a and then from a design perspective do you recommend us like giving feedback at this prompt level or should we wait until until we see what comes back sometimes it's it's like sometimes good to kind of break it into distinct blocks where it's like it's like okay let's kind of do these things and then and then you can Circle back and be like okay now I kind of do this on the design so it kind of gives you the other reason too is like you'll see here there's this undo button so if we didn't like what just happened there obviously it did fix the a so I don't want to reverse it but if we didn't like it I can click undo and it'll actually roll back to the last uh check point right so if we don't like what happens here we can either tell the like Pro reprompt the AI or we can just say Okay throw out everything you just did let's just get back to the working State and then kind of start from there um but if you if you tell the AI to do like a ton of different things and it does a lot of them right but then one of them wrong then you don't want to roll back but but you you but you know that's the only you're gonna have to manually change the code yourself so that's the benefit of kind of breaking it up into smaller to so um we're going to just send this one um and uh just going to go ahead and add that in I don't know why it keeps editing this this types file I don't want types I just want to ship um yeah so that's um yeah usually usually like having some very small Focus proc just kind of like specifically like what you're working on could be um yeah pretty helpful in that regard um you just kind of let you let you break it down into smaller pieces whatever have you sometimes when I'm building stuff I'm I like for example directory I I reference the octal is framework do you know what that is I know I never heard of that yeah it's a it's a game mechanics framework and we can maybe we can put it on the screen it it allow it's thinking it's thinking about how do you turn your product into a game so things like leaderboards things like status points things like achievements and boom this is it this feel this already starts feeling more like a game yep totally totally we got a little upot thing here or is that isn't upe thing so this this where then this is an area where it's like okay so maybe did it did it up vote it um the vote count next to each part oh oh oh oh I see this is the vter oh so I can actually do it um obviously this is just like probably in memory or whatever to start um but I mean we we could also if we want to actually make it real we could add Firebase or super base or whatever have you um but um but yeah that looks awesome and by the way I look at that my initial reaction is like whoa that you know the up voting people are going to spam that you know and just going to click up up up and then I'm like my initial reaction is no no no let's prompted to make it one vote at a time you know per person but then I was like actually it might be good that you can up vote unlimited because then you're gonna see huge up vote counts gonna feel alive true it's you know it's it's kind of like if you have people that really love the thing and they're sitting there just hammering it you know I mean that's time time is value and that is time time right like so love it um and you mentioned design wise what else um you know did you have some uh some design feedback you wanted to give Bowl on this thing um yes so I don't know it's clean which I like a lot but it just feels like we can add some more designers hate when you say this but more Pops of color um but we're not talking to a designer we're talking to bolt so no feelings hurt you know what's funny the number of times I said to buol like I'm like make it beautiful like use gradients like make it pop like it you know it actually it actually kind of it can it can kind of grab that you know um and it'll it'll at least try right it's like okay I'll I'll give it a shot you know um but we want to make it pop um you know some you know beautiful like I like color gradients or something anything in your head yeah could you I know on v0 you can you can add a image of like make it look like this could you do that on both yeah yeah absolutely absolutely yeah what uh you got you got like some inspo here um it's like a beautiful looking sight the uh it's a good question I think the arc browser has a pretty nice site okay let's pull it up um you can also use it'd be funny like I have a we have a crazy site I don't know if it would work uh have you ever seen our site L checkout. Studio I think I have um it's crazy just like from a color perspective I would be interested late checkout l a t e n my bad there we go okay yeah I do remember visiting this site okay uh we can give it a shot I mean like from a color perspective you know what I mean totally totally this this is the arc one the AR one okay let's um here tell you what I'm going to go and just take a screenshot of this thing let's just let's see I mean if we don't like it we can just roll it back that's a beautiful thing um so um uh and instead of gradients um attached um is a beautiful thank you site uh the colors are amazing um very unique uh maybe you can like capture the vibe yeah into a product list site yeah see what happens this is crazy I yeah this this I I mean I I don't know what we're going to get back but is GNA be interesting um yeah I mean there we go it's it's taking a crack at it that's yeah I mean I didn't think that it would be able to do it but based on that reaction I'm feeling optimistic it it feels confident at least you know totally out of the three of us bolt feels pretty confident right now um but I mean it is surprising you know just and that's kind of the fun thing about the stuff is you the thing about these AI products and bolt included is like there are things you'll tell it and it's just like how the heck can it do that you know and then there's things you give it to and you're like how is it so dumb right and so when you kind of run into the dumb things it's it's um you know I guess and I actually for people that are like Indie hackers or like bootstrapping or sping side projects especially people that are not like uh you know seasoned engineers or something right there is just a ridiculous amount of alpha in becoming good at at like getting a feel for how to really drive like llms right because you can just go and I mean you look at this I mean this is that's I this you know that's a it took the color palette you know it added these like icons you know it's just it did a good job right I mean it actually you know and this is that you know to do this as like an engineer or designer it's like it would take longer than what what we just did um and and so I think there there's kind of an Arbitrage opportunity where I think a lot of software Engineers have been kind of late to the game on trying to adopt AI tools um and also the way that they're kind of approaching is very different than someone who is uh you know kind of entrepreneurial in nature and and it's just that's the nature of Entrepreneurship you're dealing with you know building and launching products into the market is is not deterministic you have to you have to kind of like feel if things are working and like of course looking at metrics or whatever it's similar to like making llms work well for you and um and so like you a lot of the people that have been adopting Bull have been folks that are building a micro sass folks that are building um you they like Indie hackers or whatever have you it's no surprise to me because because they're the ones that that have been able you know make sense they could Master uh how to use a tool like this faster than anyone else in the world you know so any just as a as an aside all right there she is oh yeah took took your color scheme thank you for that my pleasure my pleasure um cool what you say should we should we like deploy this thing yeah yeah let's deoy it that's one of the cool things about bolt is um it's not just for like making UI um and you can actually make kind of you know backend aspects um to this which we we I think we we might have enough time to actually kind of you know go and try and add some you know log in or something but um it's got you know built-in deployment to production host on netfi like to do is just click this uh deploy button up here in top right um and that'll actually tell bolt that uh you want to do a production build and get a real URL for this um that's pretty cool because uh now it's not just prototyping some UI it's actually getting this onto you know a URL you can send to your friends and your family or whatever or actually attach a real domain to um and uh you actually go and start getting Google to rank this for SEO right um which is pretty cool you don't have to log in that's the other kind of cool thing about this is that uh it's actually doing this build in your browser uploading it directly to nfy and uh we go ahead and view it here there it is live on prod crazy that's crazy man wow look at that look at that add that little Shadow thing yeah that's actually that's a nice little touch this is cool this is actually I the your color palette actually really it's calming I think that people yeah people are interested in more calming design right now it is it it feels it feels unique cuz it's I I you know quick ad break let me tell you about a business I invested in it's called boring marketing.com so a few years ago I met this group of people that were some of the best SEO experts in the world they were behind getting some of the biggest companies found on Google and the secret sauce is they've got got a set of technology and AI that could help you outrank your competition so for my own businesses I wanted that I didn't want to have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I didn't want to depend on ads to drive customers to my businesses I wanted to rank high in Google that's why I like SEO and that's why I use boring marketing.com and that's why I invested in it they're so confident in their approach that they offer a 30-day Sprint with 100% money back guarantee who does that nowaday so check it out highly recommend boring marketing.com yeah I think there's there's kind of like the uh the the the linear homepage the the you know like that that's sort of like it's just you they're beautiful but but they're it's a lot and um this is this feels I like I actually really like the the feel of this um you I'm not just saying that is it's pretty cool um so um any yeah so that's it so if I wanted to actually attach a production domain you can click this link and in netlify uh you can then you know point to domain at this and um you know this this you know this is a production website that we built here which is pretty cool um yeah so got to get an idea of you know how to how to kind of uh push this thing and um make make the AI creative based on The Vibes you give it you know is it me or is this way more simple than cursor if you're not a developer oh yeah I mean 100% right and like when we when we originally like you know we put bolt online like we you know because you got to understand like from from our point of view at stack but we we've been in the business of making web idees like you know to kind of like to this is this I'm showing you here this is this is our has been our product for seven years like this is what we do um you know you can open up repos and like and when you open these things up uh it's an it's an IDE right like it's not there's no AI there's no you know so people we we we had some people building microsofts with this but I mean it was you know it was like a couple percent of our user base if that right um so we put bolts online we we thought developers were going to be you know we thought developers were gonna you know dig it because it you know allows them to punch out code faster and stuff um and we but and we certainly didn't think this would we would get compared to cursor um but you know kind of from when we launched what we ended up finding is a lot of a lot of folks have been you know adopting cursor that are again not like you know uh uh like Engineers per se like you know bu byy their their day job or whatever um and and bold is amazing for this right because yeah like when you come to cursor it's you're getting something that looks like this more or less and in reality it you you actually don't really want to be looking at the code you know as as the default thing you actually ideally you you're having a more powerful simple discussion um at a high level with with the actual AI agent right um and so that's like I think that's been you know really one of the key things that folks say to us is like I love how simple this is I love that I can just you I come here I just tell it what I want and it makes it versus me having to go clone some repo install stuff then I can tell cursor to kind of edit stuff um and that's not a knock against against cursor I mean like you know we use cursor to build bolt you know like in our own code base um and we use bolt to like scaffold out UI so there's kind of like a mix of where these things fall in but yeah I mean 100% I mean this is uh far simpler to get you know go from idea to production with right and it's simp but is it as powerful like I mean maybe we'll talk about it when we want to build this micro SAS app next but could you do as much with bolt as you can with cursor I think I and I think in the context of building web applications you can do a ton I mean you can you can build something that's actually got like a back end where you have off and you know like we have people that have launched real products just using bolt at this point where they're like taking stripe for you know subscriptions and like they're using super base to authenticate and like you know blah blah blah blah blah so you can 100% build real stuff with bull I think where cursor really shines is like cursor is a um you know it's it's a a heavyweight tool that that's designed to work with uh you know code bases at like the Fortune 500 even right that that have been yob has been around for decades you know um and so it's it's it's it's they have to they have to design the tool for kind of a different audience there um and that does that doesn't mean that curs is not useful um but and you can certainly do kind of quote unquote a lot more with cursor like you can build any type of software with cursor but um you know when it comes to building like a full stack web app um you know unless you have very specific requirements that you know would be hard to do in bolt or something I mean God it's tough to beat tough to beat how fast and uh simple and Powerful this thing is you know um so should we should we try to build something that's a bit more complex just for fun let's do it yeah I'm down um we can we can give it a shot what's uh what's an idea you got something that's that's complex me requires like you know log in or I don't know something like that maybe like a chat app I don't know something something uh you know something that's uh real time per se that'd be cool yeah what do you think maybe maybe maybe it'll be a complimentary site to our Indie hacker site you know it's like Indie hacker chat you know um and you know I'm kind of wondering actually maybe I just uh maybe I just pull this back up um yeah and I say uh you know was let's add like a a live chat page or something to this yeah um okay we want to add a live chat page um to this site for Indie hackers to um you know in real time communicate with one another um I don't know how much more specific I want to be at this point I'm just gonna like I'm just gonna you know add it and I'll I'll tell it what to use um okay I don't want to use a I don't want to do that um is that I don't know what that is I actually have no idea what it is it's probably good sorry a people if you're watching this I just I just have never heard of it I I'm not familiar with it um so a lot a lot of people ask us so in the future in Bolt when you ask something like this we're going to have kind of recommended providers where it's like one click to set it up and blah blah blah um which is which G to be super cool um but right now like we we actually recommend people use Firebase or super base they just kind of tend to be the ones that that really work the best with bolt they have kind of offb built-in they have uh real time data storage and synchronization um so I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna just revert back here um and I'm gonna go put this in I'm gonna say uh you know uh use Firebase and just just so that it punches out the thing that uh I know should work pretty well this this is the one thing I will say coming into this I do know this works well we've had probably hundreds or you know over a thousand people that have kind of asked this question so I uh uh I I won't play dumb and and let us go down the path of uh uh trying to use something you know that that might not work May might work I don't know but um the Firebase should should work without an issue here so um while that's going I'm going to go ahead and let me go and pull up the Firebase console here let's create um Indie hacker chat and uh okay what else do I got to do you have to be oh I not my stacks account okay let's try the here all right Indie hacker chat select parent resource Stacks sure there we go okay um nope Google analytics wait yeah maybe folks would want that I don't right now um this thing's still cranking over here why did you say I just want people to chat with one another versus I want a Discord like experience or you know what was the thinking behind behind that yeah fair enough there there wasn't a ton and I I I think the main thing I was thinking is let's like start with something simple because if it if it doesn't work then um at least there's not a ton of functionality for things to have to like sift through um and um that that was that was pretty much the only reason but uh one of our one of our folks actually did do like I think at the launchable we actually had like a Discord app for musicians was like the prompt um actually worked uh so you can add you know you can you can have it be something more sophisticated once this thing's built too we can we can go and say add like presents when people are online or whatever you know and stuff like that um so the same punch out looks like uh man this this is this is coming through kind of slow I think our AI provider is uh is anthropic and uh you know ever ever since they now I don't if anyone saw this but then they uh you know co-pilot is allowing Sonet Usage Now kind of noticed a little bit of slowdown Microsoft yeah I that's I mean I'm just saying like I don't know I have no Insider info but I mean I've just kind of noticed since that stuff went live uh it seems like their gpus are melting interesting that makes sense it kind of does right it kind of does I mean I must imagine there they're just getting hammered with you know I mean that get co-pilot used by so many people um but um yeah so this thing is still punching out let me go and find the uh where do you actually get that I think it's in the build section um realtime database okay create database so I think we will need this sure that looks good let's start in test mode cool all right yeah so just to build something quick um you so with Firebase um I think with like superbase uh you know the when you're going into production you're going to want to make sure you have like your permissions on the the database set up properly so people can't like you know write into other users data or read users data that sort of thing for the sake of this test Mode's nice especially when you're like prototyping something because you know you can Circle back and just add that stuff later this just makes it way faster for us to just get something running and um you know actually build out the functionality and then we can Circle back and add the relevant like permissions or whatever have you here right um okay so this thing uh and actually I'm glad this happen so one thing that this should be fixed in the next day or two sometimes the LM forgets to restart the dev server um so you can either say like you know like restart the dev server uh because right now there's no preview um I I think this one will just be npm run Dev so I just go and run that and it'll kick this thing up um and uh replace the Firebase config with your own credentials when deploying the current ones are placeholders okay good to know um where are those credentials let's find out um probably in here yep there it is okay uh awesome okay I don't know where that chat page is but uh so I have to ask where the chat page is oh there's a problem what is the problem okay I don't I don't think that that's actually a problem here let me go a and just like pop in our API keys to start off here so um I'm G to just pull this in another window just make it easy for me to copy and paste um let's see where in Firebase do you get this information okay probably there uh project settings I love that there's problems here because this is what you're you know you're going to expect so the you know even the the co-founder of Bol himself is having problems sometimes it's I mean that's that's just the nature of these things too right it's like I think and our job on Bold is to like go and you know smooth this out um and then like find all these different edge cases and this is like especially why we're gonna have you know uh preferred providers we're gonna kind of integrate it's just to make this really really seamless to to get all this stuff in here um kind where to find fire base key uh go to product settings man I this is insane I how do I how can I not find this thing um maybe I'm just gonna pull this back over here let's find out uh feel this is probably good feedback for um oops didn't mean to do that let me go back good feedback for the Firebase team how the heck do I get I was gonna say we should have invited the co-founder of Firebase on this call too this is insanity how how am I how am I unable to find this um couldn't we just like ask like Cloe or perplexity or some you know where to F good good point um uh where to get Firebase API keys and dashboard Cloe has become my like go-to to customer technical customer support person yeah actually actually um it's same thing for me okay so project overview to open project settings I think we were there and then scroll into our apps ah okay got it okay so we have to actually uh create a web app uh okay like how would we have known that I don't know you know I swear to God it used to be something that was just like listed there I mean that that that was non I don't know I do this for a living that was not obvious to me you know what what that thing was doing there um okay so let me go ahead and U Pull the code up here uh so Firebase config I I figure I ought to just be able to um copy and paste this and pop it over into here would be my guess yep I mean kind of seems like it okay save and um so my question is how do we to the chat page um Pages chat oh there's like a chat route okay so if I go there oh okay so there there is there is a chat thing um okay so for the sake I don't know how much time we have left here but um let's see popup block Firebase ER okay I think it might be because we're in a in the preview here so so um let's just have a remove the off just for now just so that we can uh you know try this thing out so remove the uh need to sign in to chat and by the way this is a good learning especially for the non-dev audience is like something's not working just go like one feature at a time and I think that was kind of your nature around like why you even prompted it instead of doing Discord for whatever create a Discord like experience and just saying get me real time chat you're it's just a lot less features and then you can add on one at a time totally totally yeah especially especially when you're dealing with stuff that's going to be like more like more complicated functionality like for for design changes I'll often just I'll just kind of like I'll I'll be like looking at the design just creating a list in in one chat MTH like here's this thing sucks make this better da d d d da when it comes to functionality I'm glad you point that out because it's something I didn't really actually realize um until you kind of asked why I did it but like yeah with functionality I'm I'm much more conservative because it's just okay add chat what does that mean I mean like what's that going to like look at like you how there's a lot of things that could probably go wrong when the LM is going to go and try and punch that out right so it's like kind of like when you're adding function just do it like the absolute minimal thing get it to work then say okay then add this thing onto it and da da da um but yeah that's you know that uh you kind of allows you to just you know slowly but surely um build the thing out in a way that's going to be you know pretty reliable right um let's see what happens here here uh oh let's go okay so I actually asked it uh to on the homepage yeah there we go look at that join the chat join the chat all right uh Eric wow I mean come on let's go this is uh and so I guess if I refresh um let me put in Eric again um let me see uh is there what error happened is this an error okay no um so let me I wonder if it's uh let's go to our Firebase let's see if it's actually storing the data in here go to uh real time database um are the shots being stored in Firebase uh real time database I could probably go look at the code but you know it it should be able to know aha okay um oh okay okay sorry it actually was stor it was storing it in Firebase fire store let's see if we actually had any results because that's that's one thing with um with fire there's like two different database products I I personally just reach for fire uh the real time database because that is the thing that I am the most familiar with um like that's you know back this is my uh 2020s hacker era I don't you know like back in the day Firebase was like Firebase realtime database was the thing um but uh let's see so yeah I don't oh you know what there isn't a DAT because I I had created a real time one so that's why the persistence probably wasn't working here so um okay let's see what this thing does as it goes and punches this out yeah pretty wild um and by the way one of our devell folks um or I should say not one of our devrell person Tomac amazing guy um he made a tutorial on how to uh use Firebase with bolt uh this past week I can kind of let me go and find the YouTube video pull it up um he did a really good job on this um but we can throw that in the YouTube description for people who want to go and watch that as a followup to this yeah absolutely yeah so that definitely worth the watch because um I mean he goes into you know way more detail um so just kind of you know so this this is the video um how to add a database to your bolt. new app um super cool it's got a you know good amount I mean for our we have like a thousand subscribers a good number of people watched the thing um okay let's try this out so uh let's see if it's uh if it'll work hello and uh let's go there it is look at that okay okay here now what we have to do let's deploy this thing let's deploy this thing and and Greg let's chat let's chat together on our Indie hacker site because like we can do that I'm gonna send you this link and uh you can share your screen or I can keep sharing mine and uh we can you know we can chat together um no don't do do that don't do that hang on no don't don't don't create my EMV file what are you doing don't do that this is this is one the we have actually a fix coming for this so what's going on is uh the LM is being smart and it's like you shouldn't hardcode your variables in this file what are you doing are you insane um especially if we're going to deploy a PR we need to fix this so so one of the things we're we're going to be adding is um you locking files so the llm will not modify stuff ET honestly that was probably this is what you should do if you're going to prod to be fair like it I'm kind of I'm kind of dunking on it but that's this is actually um this this is probably the right the right move let's make sure that that this still works real quick um okay yeah so uh here we go ahead and uh is there do we have a chat here we do okay let me go um Studio chat go ahead and open this up come come join the chat let's see see this work I'm coming I'm coming from from uh from Florida right yes sir all right so from from across the continental US I'm in the Bay Area on the on the west coast let's see let's see if this happens all right I'm in look at that oh there we go let's go and that's the that's the coolest part about this is we started off with a directory to get traffic and then all of a sudden now where this like social you know app SAS app you know it's just it's it's mindblowing because uh it's just it's just your ideas you just have to have really good ideas yeah totally and and it's it's amazing right because because that's that's like how it should be you know like you should be able to just you know have amazing ideas and and be able to go and put them into into production like there's been a you know it's been really cool to see a lot of uh again people in like the Indie hacker Community going and doing this where um there's this um uh this gal her name's pitch she's from Thailand and she made this app called viral hooks I can uh vir H so she built this entirely with Bol right and uh like a week or two after launch we uh my my chief of staff and I got on the phone with her because she was you she was you know one of our power users like what talk to us about what you're doing really cool app it basically this she's built this app that helps you uh build viral hooks for your uh you know your Tik Tok posts and things like that and she had uh a week before we launched bolt she had actually put a post on upwork you know just trying to find a developer to like build out this idea for her and she's like a a PM at like a a you know software Banking Company or something in Thailand and um you know so uh she got uh you a couple different proposals and they were like basically in the range of was like it was like three or 5K to build this app uh and it's going to take you know I don't know a couple months or something which like I mean you know reasonable right I mean like you I've I've done a good amount of software Contracting I've contracted softare devs I mean that that's that's like seems like a pretty reasonable price in time frame um but you know if you're paying out of pocket for like a side project or you know Etc it's a little good amount of money and so when we launched bolt she she you signed up on our $50 a month plan and she had this thing built in like a week and a half or two weeks or something and which is crazy right I mean like that's it was like one literally one 100th the cost and you know five or 10 times faster than than she was quoted at right uh so it's just it's it's it's it's unbelievable the amount of Leverage that you can have if you're someone who's really creative entrepreneurial um you know Fire Starter that wants to go and build stuff and just build cool stuff that like looks good right I mean um this is this is this is unbelievable this could be like a you know a startup in s that's backed by seoa for all I know right yeah I mean the stuff that's like you know there's a there's a guy named Paul who made a a CRM called like CH Siam I think and um and and they look they look professional you know it's kind to this point you know uh we've had uh YC startups already they've come to bolt to build their landing pages and stuff you know because it's just like like one of uh one of my friends his his company is a YC company he um uh they're doing like data pipeline stuff above my pay grid I you know it's just that's like the hardcore backend engineering stuff and uh you know they have better stuff to be doing than bring a a front-end landing page about their product you know I mean it's like they they should be working on the data pipeline thing right like that's their their their secret sauce and and then so that's what they did is they they came and and you know just spent 30 minutes you kind of prompting you know their their their site into existence and you it looks great um so it's just crazy can you at the pricing page on here I'm just curious like what she what she charges so I mean it's it's crazy like she's gonna she's probably making real money with this um yeah it's it's absolutely Bonkers um yep can't there's there's there's a there's there's at least a dozen people that have launched stuff that have said yep I've had my first customer or you know first dozen customers or whatever at this point from Bol you know it's crazy um yeah it's it's it's wild it's wild like really you know and I love it this is this is why this is why we started Stacks in the first place is we just we felt seven years ago when we started the thing was like we felt that people should be able to build web apps using the web you know it's like you should be able to in a browser come you know just build things uh without to download stuff to your computer and Etc and um it's just like you would any like you when you write a document these days you make a design in figma you're not downloading some some giant thing to your computer it's like you can share these URLs um you know that's that's kind of the magic of this well Eric I appreciate you you know you're running probably one of the hard hottest AI startups right now and just scaling really quickly but you chose to spend a little bit of time with us and and show us how to how to build and how to use the tool and I'm really grateful for that I think I'd love to see people in the comment section just comment and and and comment if you enjoyed this and and and you know send Eric some love for sure uh he deserves it and uh Eric where could where could people get get going on bolt how do how do how should people start yeah totally I mean you head over to bolt. new I mean it's and and it's it's uh the simplest thing ever there's like an input box type in your wildest dreams hit enter I mean maybe not wildest but you know like type in type in something pretty well you know thought out or whatever um and uh but yeah start there and then um uh we can share the tutorial um that that toic made on over on X where um you can follow at stack Blitz we're constantly posting stuff there um and uh yeah on Discord we're discord.gg stackl so uh yeah I'm stoked to see what everyone builds really excited to see what everyone uh you know has to say about this stuff and thanks for having me on this has been this has been a blast I man I've I've had a lot of fun building something all right thanks a lot man I'll catch you later awesome all right have a good one [Music] baby

Title: 24 year old making $1m/month from AI shares 3 startup ideas
Published: 2024-11-06 18:31:45 UTC
Description:
Join me as I chat with Blake Anderson, Co-Founder of Apex, as we discuss his frameworks and strategies for building and scaling viral AI Apps. Blake shares 3 ai startup ideas and learn his step-by-step formula creating viral apps. 

Episode Timestamps: 
00:00 Intro
02:47  Why build AI Apps
04:46 Startup Idea 1: Career AI
08:07 Blake's framework for building Viral AI Apps
10:25 Finding influencers
13:11 Product Development
17:13 Startup Idea 2: Journal AI
23:48 Paywalls and Monetization Strategy
28:50 Startup Idea 3: Language AI
35:12 How to find more AI app ideas

1) Career AI: The all-in-one career advancement tool
• Combines resume analysis, career quizzes, & job application tips
• Use AI to create a 6-factor rating system for resumes (like Madden ratings)
• Design viral hooks: "I'm a senior and it says I should study CS!"

Distribution strategy:
• Target students on IG, TikTok, LinkedIn
• Partner with ed-tech influencers
• Split test different hooks across niches

2) Journal AI: Your AI-powered second brain
• Branded as a journal, functions like an emotional support assistant
• Provides productivity insights, relationship analysis, and emotional support
• Uses ChatGPT with enhanced memory storage
Key insight: People already use ChatGPT as a journal. This makes it official.
Naming tip: Consider friendly names like "Juni" or "Journey" instead of "AI"

3) Language AI: The Duolingo disruptor
• Create a dynamic, AI-powered language learning app
• Leverage newest AI voice-to-voice models as they become cheaper
• Update content dynamically, unlike Duolingo's static modules

Why it could work:
• Even 1% of Duolingo's market = $100M company
• High-intent users willing to pay
• Established players move slower than scrappy startups

4) Blake's framework for building viral AI apps:
1. Iterate on virality from day one
2. Split test hooks, influencers, and product features
3. Build personal relationships with influencers (don't use marketplaces)
4. Design around both functionality AND virality
5. Use tools like Superwall for easy paywall testing

5) Pricing strategy: Optimize for (users^n * profit per user), where n is greater than 1
• This prioritizes growth and market dominance over short-term profits.
• Blake's hot take: The "evil" onboarding flow that works

1. Get users to input personal info for "customization"
2. Hit them with a paywall at the end

• It's effective, but Blake admits it feels morally questionable. Use at your own risk.

6) Bonus tip: Create burner social media accounts to immerse yourself in your target niche.
• Curate your feed around your app's topic to truly understand your audience.

so what's up Blake what's going on Greg thank you very much for having me on today I decided to reach out to you I've been following you for a while um but I I saw a tweet about a month ago that said I recently discovered a part of the internet where a bunch of cracked 18 to 22 year old Indie hacker kids from noname Unis run boot Trap mobile apps growth hacked on Tik Tok each app has a 100,000 monthly users and makes $15 million a year never underestimate the kids and did some research and they were talking about you and your friends and how you have kind of like a Ai mobile app Studio doing I think you know 15 million in ARR so I was hoping that you can come on today and share with everyone some AI app ideas yep happy to do so start [Music] quick context on myself I kind of stumbled into this uh space a little bit over a year ago with an app called Riz GPT it is now named plug AI uh we end up scaling that to a little bit over 3 million downloads 200,000 monthly Revenue then built umax uh that has done over 10 million downloads 500,000 monthly Revenue now I think it's closer to 400,000 but at at our Peak we were around 700,000 in monthly Revenue um and then most recently Cal AI which we launched just like a little bit over 6 months ago and is at about 2 million downloads and over a million dollars a monthly Revenue yeah I think I'm uh like I mentioned I kind of just happened to stumble into this space but it's a pretty fascinating place of the internet and specific specifically entrepreneurship to be right now because it kind of takes the intersection of new functionality in terms of applications that can be built as a result of AI crossed with novel distribution tactics largely pioneered by uh e-commerce people um and so when you take the two of those together it creates for this uh this space where you have like a small proportion of kids essentially like age 18 to 22 I myself I'm 23 uh that are kind of running the entire uh the entire space and at the Forefront of it absolutely man and I think uh a lot of people like me who are in my 30s and I'm sure people listening in their 40s 50s 60s are kind of like what's going on uh with the Tik Tok kids and um it's interesting to see that a lot of the products have ai with it I mean I'm not surprised but um yeah what's your take on that like is there an opportunity before you get into your ideas and before we like start cooking basically is there an opportunity to create apps that are have like not a or do you have to come up with an AI app idea for Tik Tok yeah so I believe that and I'm really excited to get into some of the ideas that we have to share uh later on but I believe that we're currently just scratching the surface of new uh application functionality that can be built and delivered to the end user um using these new AI tools so for example uh with umax UMX was a facial analysis and recommendation application in the past this was possible to build however it would have taken significant investment into developing internal prop proprietary uh ml facial recognition models in order to build it however with the use of AI uh specifically GPT Vision I was able to do so with essentially zero upfront development cost with the exception of my own time um I think that what we're seeing right now as I mentioned we're like scratching the surface of these new functionalities but what AI really enables us to do is to deliver personalized and like personalized functionality that can be updated in real time um through the use of these AI backends as well as building uh technologies that previously would have costed a lot of money and so we're seeing the new Tik Tock AI apps like this is the start but as we progress as AI becomes uh more advanced and uh increasing functionality as as well as people building more complex uh applications with it I think what we're going to see is just a 10x um in N user experience uh with regard to how we interface with technology cool well yeah let's let's dive in what's idea number one what do you got for us so as you guys have heard the the applications that I built have really been uh around sort of AI virality uh the first two specifically R GPT how to text girls Max how to look Max right but Cal AI was that was primarily around functionality you take an archaic uh sort of Industry uh calorie tracking where it was not very easy for the end user ton of people have gripes with apps like my fitness pal and you make it easier with the use of AI and so this is what I increasingly think about not building apps where you can just kind of uh you know leverage the Tik Tok algorithm to hack your way into a little bit of cash but like how how do we redefine how the the value that people get out of so my first idea that I have is uh an application for lack of a better word career AI as we all know there are a lot of new very popular um fragmented career advancement tools by fragmented what I mean is you have a website that you can go on that gives you an analysis of your resume and it'll give you all the B bullet points about how to improve it we also have websites where you can take quizzes in terms of uh that will give you recommendations of what your future career should be based on your personality we have people that sell courses about how to apply to different jobs but I believe that an all-in-one integrated platform that kind of takes a bunch of these different fragmented um uh tools and puts it into career AI I think that that would be a pretty amazing application uh and specifically as someone who just recently graduated from college I know the trouble that a lot of people have in uh finding jobs finding internships that sort of thing um and it's a massive industry to begin with like one of the uh primary selling points of universities is that like they're going to set you up for your future career now I think that a career AI you charge 50 bucks a month for an all-in-one Tool uh to me feels pretty obvious um and then with regards to distribution I would go about it you know the pretty standard Instagram TI to reals obviously Target students uh but then you could leverage Twitter or x.com in addition to LinkedIn for some relatively untapped uh distribution channels shh don't tell anyone but I've got 30 plus startup ideas that could make you millions and I'm giving them away for free these aren't just random guesses they're validated Concepts from entrepreneurs who built hundred million plus businesses I've compiled them into one simple database compiled from hundreds of conversations I've had on my podcast but the main thing is most of these ideas don't need a single investor some cost nothing to start I'm pretty much handing you a cheat sheet the idea bank is your startup shortcut just click below to get access your next cash flow business is waiting for you so I want to go deeper into basically how how you have like what's the Blake Anderson framework for for taking an idea and actually making it like a mainstream product I guess um so for example like you said yeah just Target students with Instagram reals and you know LinkedIn and Tik Tok like could you walk us through what you would do if you were building this and you had this idea like okay you have the idea where do you go from here yeah so I believe that there is a uh people often fall victim to seeing the new uh trendy way to go viral and then putting all of their eggs into that basket I think that something that all of my applications have really benefited from is I'm engaging in a highly iterative process of generating virality from early on and so that means coming up with new hooks figuring out new ways to position the product in terms of who you're marketing to um and split testing those over a rolling basis so let's say that I really think that influencer marketing is going to work with uh this career AI application I'll find influencers in the General Ed Tech space uh that talk about study tips I'll find influencers that give tips on how to apply to jobs I'll get find influencers that give General productivity tips I will come up with different hooks that could uh theoretically work within each of those niches I'll then split test these hooks across different videos across different creators and assess the results assess how many views we're generating based on which hook uh what the relative conversion is based on on a per viiew basis uh for each of them and then over time you start to develop either a mental or real statistic model statistical model um that will be able to inform your future uh distribution uh strategy I hope that makes sense but somewhat akin to how platform platforms meta Tik Tok Etc will split test your different creatives uh applying the same strategy to influencers or internal ugc or uh you know creative hook generation that sort of thing and how do you find the influencers like do you do you go through um do you just like kind of reach out to them yeah so I was actually looking at this today because I thought that this is uh pretty indicative of what I do which is kind of different from a lot of people number one I don't use uh influencer marketplaces or databases number two I think that there's a lot of messaging on the internet about various tools so like the marketplace and databases or agencies um to to find influence for you that's just like outright wrong what I don't see people talking about is the development of personal relationships with influencers so I just recently launched my new Company Apex I can get into that a little bit later but in short it's a very content heavy company we're creating content in-house and now you'll see I make this post and like I guess this is backwards but I've got a bunch of creators like Sam Zia commented he was a former co-founder from Max 220,000 followers Dawson Gibbs 170 or 170,000 followers back State Carter 280,000 followers the list goes on and on um and now the reason that they're commenting on this isn't because I'm paying them to but it's because I've developed the relationships with them and I think that or I know that these influencers are getting hundreds of DMS emails what have you on a daily basis it's really hard for them to differentiate what companies are serious and what companies aren't but if you can embed yourself uh and develop personal relationships with them embed yourself within the industry then they'll connect you with whoever you need to get connected with so yeah I mean it's it's it's funny you mention it like to me it's like you say this and it's obvious you're basically like yeah you know they're human beings uh you know create a relationship with them get to know them better and that's the that's kind of like the most effective way of doing it um um but yeah that's kind of like the a bit of the opposite of what other people say which is they're like yeah go on to these platforms reach out to you know what I mean listen I I totally agree with it reach out to as many as you can I always say prioritize early on both quantity and quality you got to reach out to thousands of them you gota you gotta if there's a creator that you really want you have to DM them on every single platform you have to message their mom you have to message their girlfriend saying I want to pay your son money please put in contact like I've done that before that like that can kind of help solve your cold start from there you got to treat them well become friends with them and then the opportunities become endless the product like we kind of you know we said it's an all-in-one product but like how do you how do you take an idea how do you take this idea and actually flesh it out and and make it a real product like how do you think about it so okay first off I think that similar to what I was saying about split testing different uh hooks across different niches about why people should download your product if for example with career AI here if we're embedding multiple different tools into the platform what we can do is we can also split test different product hooks so we could test let's say we have three different tools within the application then we could test different tools on social media to see what's going to go the most viral and we could engineer around virality with umax for example this was the uh facial analysis ratings we found that this sort of six Factor Madden rating system that's what people were most drawn to that's what people were most likely to like comment engage with and therefore went the most viral I want I want to to make that clear from the start because that is kind of how I begin my ideation process what are the tools that are going to do well on social media explain see so so that will inform design and then my process for design is usually I do wireframes I have either a professional designer or someone on upwork convert that into more flesh out UI uh and then it becomes time to build with regards to building I myself I use chat GPT to teach me uh how to code to build Riz GPT and umax now if you have Capital this is not a route that I recommend if you have Capital connections to Great CTO like don't you don't need to do that yourself but if you're just getting started like I was at the time you get the designs done and then you start you figure it out so for me it was talking to chat GPT on a daily basis uh originally I used Swift UI so I was getting code from chipt and Swift UI placing that into xcode moving forward um now when I code I'm doing it in a cursor with react native I just started doing this about a month ago quick note I did not code CI so I coded R GPT in the first version of umax yeah I think that people are often looking for like a one-size fits-all answer when it comes to the development side of things I just don't think that it exists I think that it's different for everybody butt what I say is what I'm doing now is a react native incursor and with career AI specifically like if you were building this like what features do you think would be need to have so I would think around uh two things like think around the cross between functionality and virality uh the resumé analysis that's that's very high functionality now how do we take something that's functional right scanning someone's resumee and giving tips on how they can improve it how do we also make that Viral so what I would probably do here is a sixf factor rating system similar to umax I would give them scores based on different sections of their resume now I would see design those scores around the sort of popular edte content right now getting cont with thech creators and then have them start to post so that's just on the resume analysis side of things I would also do a career analysis you take a quiz and then at the end of it it's a nice pretty screen that says you should go into X Y and Z and then I would probably figure out how to create a trend which is like people being really excited because they're a senior and they got recommended computer science and that's what they've been studying and then people being like wait why did it why why did it take until I'm a senior to realize that I shouldn't be studying this and then create create that content on social media and I think that I can make that Viral relatively quickly cool all right thanks for that free idea career AI what's uh idea number two okay idea number two is Journal AI I haven't seen anyone crack this quite yet I know people have spoken about it the way that I would build it is somewhat of an AI second brain but branded and framed as a journal um and the sort of analysis that you would get would be things that would help increase your productivity emotional support relationship analysis um and I really don't think it would have to be that technically robust I would say essentially just chat GPT uh with uh more complex memory storage and UI that's more conducive to journaling so when I hear that kind of like maybe because I've been around for a long a while like there's so many journaling apps is your your thesis is that the AI angle is enough to kind of to get people excited is that is that the thesis yeah so I think one of my thesis here is that I've seen people organically use chat gbt as their journal and get a lot of value out of it I've essentially done that myself um now I'm not a daily journaler but when I provide chat GPT with uh you know I have like I have notes on my computer that just have a lot of information about some topic and uh maybe too much to be contained within chat gbt's memory and when I want to go get a deeper analysis I'll go paste those in and now I think that uh yeah sort of like an emotional support assistant framed as a journal would be pretty easy to to get it to go viral as well as I think that there would be pretty high value ad um you know we have this like one-sided relationship with journals where we put in and get nothing out and that's great to some effects uh but I think the ability to get that sort of like intricate objective analysis back out similar to how we like I think a lot of people building this are thinking of it as like a therapist AI but I wouldn't brand it as that I would brand it as a journal AI if that makes sense yeah I remember Peter levels I'm sure you know him he he did AI therapist.com or something and he he he closed it down also like there's like you can't just call it a therapist because like therapy is like you know uh you can't just it's not a therapist like you know you have to go to school and stuff like that to be a to to be a therapist so um journaling also the other interesting thing is it's something that people know like they know what a journal is so if you call it like AI journal or Journal AI I mean that's a question for you like how do you think about naming some of these products and is putting and we're really getting into the nitty-gritty but I think it's important is putting AI in the name important yeah people ask this question a lot I think that uh it's hard to say at this point in time I think that the the uh appending AI is valuable when you are creating Innovation within a relatively stagnant industry such as Cal AI within uh the calorie tracking space like calorie tracking as a whole people viewed it as archaic and it's slow and it's annoying and it's complicated so then when we add AI that brings a level of sophistication now on the flip side when it's something where you know if if you're building like a medical uh doc doent service or something where like you need 100% accuracy um and any minor errors uh would would be unacceptable the system just wouldn't work I would probably not include the term AI as people would be a little bit skeptical or scar that it may become dangerous in some capacity uh so so that's how I think about but you know I mean my co-founder Zach from CI recently made a tweet about how adding AI at the end was a negative signal he and I had a lengthy discussion on that kind of came to this resolution that I just referred to just now um but yeah I guess I guess that's how I think through it and now with regards to journal AI um the the the names that I'm using right now are just because they're easy to wrap your head around I'm not sure if I would name it Journal AI maybe I would try to name it something like juny or like Journey that like feels more friendly um but yeah I wouldn't say that I'm by any means a master of naming so maybe they're better people to go to on that front yeah but I think all your names resonate like there's a reason like if you're my my thesis is that if Cal was just called calorie tracker it might not be like it probably wouldn't be where it is today that's my that's I agree I I think C is probably the name I'm most proud of um the reason for naming umax for example umax was because uh the plan was to become this like all-in-one self-improvement ecosystem that I'm now building with Apex now for a number of reasons I decided not to pursue that but in retrospective umax if the plan was to take it to where it is now I probably would have named it looksmax AI as our copycat ended up doing um so quick ad break let me tell you about a business I invested in it's called boring marketing.com so a few years ago I met this group of people that were some of the best SEO experts in the world they were behind getting some of the biggest companies found on Google and the secret sauce is they've got a set of technology and AI that could help you outrank your competition so for my own businesses I wanted that I didn't want to have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I didn't want to depend on ads to drive customer to my businesses I wanted to rank high in Google that's why I like SEO and that's why I use boring marketing.com and that's why I invested in it they're so confident in their approach that they offer a 30-day Sprint with 100% money back guarantee who does that nowadays so check it out highly recommend boring marketing.com okay cool and let's just talk before we move to the next idea can we talk about how you think about pay walls and are there any tools that you use uh for testing pay walls and and stuff like that and and how do you think about just like how pricing strategy Shameless PL for this for this in particular too like this idea yeah uh Shameless plug super wall absolutely amazing I am I'm not affiliated I just I love the platform I think that pretty much everybody should be using super wall I don't use Revenue cap I only use super wall now with regards to how I think about pay walls I think it really depends um so what's amazing about super wall is it makes split testing incredibly easy they provide you with all the data but I think that across the industry a lot of people tend to optimize for like number of users multiplied by profit per user I am of an alternative thesis I believe that you should optimize for like number of us users raised to the N where n is greater than one multiplied by profit per user um I will take at least at a just pure conversion basis I will accept a lower LTV on a per download basis um in exchange for more people being able to use the platform now there are a number of reasons for this but I think one of the um most obvious if you want to ignore all like the moral like oh I want more people to use the product more people get value of it if you want to completely set that aside um which I don't but if you were to set that aside the benefit here is that you can more quickly dominate the market and as a result um increase Word of Mouth which is pretty much impossible to measure uh for most applications uh it's easy to measure like if you're just seating a thousand users onto your product and then letting it grow organically but when you're constantly running ads you don't know if people are coming specifically like organic you have no idea where people are coming from um and so I like to prioritize allowing as many people to use it as possible now um moving forward how do I think about pay Walling in itself like within the application super wall is amazing once again because it enables you to test it at different points and you can assess the relative effects the conversion basis how many people are seeing it that sort of thing um the most standard practice in the industry right now is to take people through some onboard earning flow and then hit them with a pay wall at the end um it's just like you make so much more doing that than pretty much any other pay wall strategy when you when you say that are you talking about like it's a quiz or something like that and then at the end it's like pay push notifications and put your personal information so we can customize the application for you and then you get hit with the pay wall um I've done this for my applications for the most part uh I do not necessarily think that it's great practice but it is efficient practice if that makes sense like I don't think that it's morally great I don't like feel good about it but totally cuz like people are investing like they they might see a Tik Tok about it or real whatever they download the app they're getting they're super excited they're filling in their information they're investing essentially their time yeah and some and then they're just like oh $6.99 a week or something yeah yeah I think yeah I don't know I'd like to believe I guess it depends on how you do it right yeah I mean I so yeah I don't I don't think I I don't I don't think that it moves the needle much like I don't think that it's that good or bad I'd like to believe that with what I'm doing with the money at the very bottom of the funnel like what I'm using it for with what I'm currently building uh kind of offsets not a big deal uh like I said I think that this industry as a whole doesn't really move the needle very much uh but it is you you know the way that I generally think about these things is like capitalism is good in my belief and therefore increasing market efficiency in uh generally just taking the market in a quicker manner to its inevitable end State um and so yeah I guess that's kind of how I like offload the responsibility dude we we have to do one more idea we have to give us one last idea so I think that this is one of the biggest applications on the App Store du lingo Duolingo is an amazing application like it's built out so well now that said if you can acquire even just a couple percent of the market share by integrating new AI functionality quicker than them you build a massive product and that's where I would uh say that a good idea is a language AI or language tutoring application uh obviously the chat GPT voice too model is currently pretty expensive but my inclination is that that will significantly decrease in cost over time uh or other models will come out of similar functionality with decrease cost so by building a language tutoring application where you are uh just always up to date with the newest AI functionality and you build the UI around uh around sort of of dynamic learning like as we know du lingo generally has more static modules that you go through ABC you build a language learning application that updates dynamically I think that there's a lot of value there um a lot of value to be created as well as a lot of value to be captured people who want to learn languages are generally pretty high intent so I think that that's a that'd be a pretty awesome one to build what do you say to people who say but dualingo just announced two AI features I think it's called like Adventures or something like that like how am I gonna how how you g to compete with dualingo yeah this is exactly what people said to me when we were Building C AI people are like dude my fitness pal so big they're going to build in this space and my answer was well they won't work as hard as us their incentives internally are not aligned to the point where they will be able to iterate and and progress as quickly as us so here's what I mean by that the engineers at my fitness pal like my fitness pal to begin with has been like traded back and forth sold so many times um that the people that are doing the groundw work don't like probably don't have that much Equity you know and so the engineers don't care that much like they're just kind of doing their job similar with the social media managers and so our CIS uh uh so calorie estimations based on images are just significantly better than my fitness palette we have a pretty robust system built out at this point in addition we're pioneering new ways of marketing on social media I would wager that the same pretty much applies to Du lingo now I wouldn't be surprised if their engineering team was a lot better uh significantly higher valuation now that said uh du lingo is the go-to application for language learning right now but if you can figure out just like a few percent changes to to for people to learn languages in different ways and then some novel distribution strategies for that do a lingo is worth like what1 billion if you can uh like I said take just 1% of that market share you immediately have an application worth $100 million and I think that for the same reason that du lingo is so big there's so so few people try in which just makes it so much easier to succeed uh when applying uh these sort of New Wave tactics yeah I mean the short answer is you don't need to reinvent the wheel you know I was actually earlier this morning I was on Tik Tok Creator insights and for people who don't know uh go on Tik Tok search for T Tik Tock Creator insights and you basically get like a Google Trends but for Tik Tok and you can see you know how much what are people searching for and what's trending and stuff like that and one of the interesting things was today what was trending a ton of how to learn French how to learn Spanish how to learn Arabic how to learn Arabic I remember search volumes up a th% so yes du lingo uh you know may continue to grow may continue to be a juggernaut and that's cool but you know there's an opportunity right now with um creating AI first apps that I think um when you pair that with great Creator content there's just an opportunity to not even take part of their market share because the the reality is these people are not even using dualingo that's the that's that's the reality yeah creating new market share I totally agree I think that that is a to dive a little a little bit deeper into something I mentioned earlier like I think that a lot of these apps are just pioneering new ways uh for people to learn and improve themselves with the use of AI I think it's a pretty imp incredible personalized learning tool and when it first Chad GPD first came out in like December November of 2022 there was a lot of speculation about the future of AI tutors and within AI or learning languages or personal training that sort of thing my inclination is that uh at the very minimum the first step of this is just AI tools AI apps that do this as opposed to being like a framed as a tutor it's just do it is doing the tutoring through its UI if that makes sense yeah of course of course so yeah I I think it's it's really awesome like the plenty of room for du lingo to coexist with an application that uses AI to Pioneer completely novel um functionality within the language learning space same thing goes with calorie tracking same thing goes with uh career advancement same thing goes with journaling before before we head out like do you have any like I think people listening this are like okay those are three ideas um but they might be like how you know I want to come up with more AI app ideas and then I want to create a framework I want to framework for that do you use things like sensor Tower do you use things like um like any tools like that or are you just coming are you just coming up with these ideas while you're walking in the beach in San Diego yeah so I certainly use sensor Tower to assess like the size of the um other players in the space but I think few things have helped me one as you mentioned walking the beach like for for me it's generally hiking I find that I'm able to think very clearly two deliberate scrolling on social media and curating my feed around whatever it is that I'm interested in so I'll create burner accounts to like when I was building umax I had a burner account where it was like only looks maxing content or anytime I build a new application I create a burner account and I curate my entire feed around that and I like put myself in the mind of someone who's consuming that content um and then finally I'm actually creating like a 30 to 60 Minute um completely free somewhat of a course or YouTube video that I'm going to be posting in about a month uh as well as a completely free uh viral app Playbook PDF and so if people want to you know follow my socials Blake Anderson W on Twitter or x.com then Apex blore on Instagram uh I'll be sharing updates there amazing man that's awesome this has been a lot of fun I think um what you've drilled home for me personally is that sometimes the most obvious ideas are the best ideas calorie dragging language learning you know journaling like this is this is things that you look around in your everyday life and you see these people doing it you put an AI Twist on it you get good content out there you make friends with influencers um and you know you build small MVPs right you you don't need to to to boil the ocean when it comes to building an MVP get something out there yeah I think that like 10 out of 10 ideas are great in that it's pretty much impossible to fail with them like Riz GPT was one of those obviously with like a relatively low ceiling but it was a 10 out of 10 idea for getting my first small win um but then with regards to these ideas it's like they're pretty straightforward they're pretty plate but if you can just follow like the standard methods of like the the new styles of execution of building a functionality of distribution you can pretty easily build a massive application thanks my man I appreciate you we appreciate you later

what is the promise that you will deliver on in this episode I promise you you're gonna have like seven AI apps that you can go and build with the data validating all of it and with the trend like all that information and I'm going to give you all the distribution to do the marketing for all of these so you're going to walk away with this with like the idea you just have to build it and I'm going to tell you how to do the distribution and so you just have to execute basically start [Music] yes and it's not just a distribution hack that worked a year ago when I when I'm talking to Cody he gives you the sauce he he spills the beans that works right now I'm a practitioner baby like that's just what kills me about these course creators right like they're just selling old ideas to people it drives me nuts also it do not like if you want to know anything just like literally send me a DM on Twitter and I will make a public video showing everything on how to do all of this like drives me crazy man they're like going in they buy this 5K cold email thing and the the data is like two years old that's like a lifetime in this world right like in the last week we had infrastructure changes that we had to make so that we could even do cold email you know like it just anyway just tell me and I will publicly do it whatever they're selling you I will publicly do it for free and give it away to you for free doing God's work okay let's get uh let's get down to business what's idea number one cool uh idea number one is ugc ADS but using AI for them uh rather than using real people and I'm going to lay out why this is an opportunity why this is happening first off what I want to do is I want to show this data to the audience so this is search volume for ugc ads going absolutely crazy and the bigger thing that's Happening Here is that ugc content traditionally was used for ads but now there's this opportunity to use AI avatars and scripts that are written by uh like Ai and I'm going to walk through this exact execution and process and then you take those and you can use those both as ads but you can also use that as organic social right so I had a video go viral like literally on Twitter this week and a bunch of other places as well and it's a he Jen AR talking over screenshots of stuff and then basically it like pitches the product so I want to break this down of like why this is working and the opportunity that's here for somebody to build an agency or even a product around this I think who you just had on the Pod recently is doing this type of work which is super interesting I don't know anything about about it um but I've been you know we've been deep in trying to figure this out for the last like nine months of how do you scale this up because like we we can build out you know these clouds of social accounts that can get these views but the content has to be good so this is how you do that so what we're seeing work right now is you basically do a problem solution style storytelling that has the product be the hero within that so the best way to do this is you have a human write the initial script and the script can be something like so I was talking to my friend and they were telling me that their email newsletter is just blowing up right and like lit you know the the content is it shows the graph behind it and so the script then goes so I asked them like how are they writing this email newsletter and they're like oh well what I'm doing is I'm not actually even writing it I just record a minute a 30 minute video of me talking and then I take that transcript and I have it turn it into a newsletter and then I asked them like what how are they doing this and they told me they use this tool called swell Ai and so now I'm thinking about starting my newsletter because it's so much easier than it was before right take that script and you go to chat GPT and you're like create me 10 different scripts similar to this one in the first person that are in this format it's going to write 10 different variations you take those 10 different variations and you then take them over to something like haen or argil AI um or argal I'm not sure they're French um I think they're based out of Paris but sick their API is awesome um and generate all these then hand these off to like a cracked developer or sorry cracked uh video uh editor and you give them the assets and they crank all of these out right you can literally like do this in the script if you don't want to use a an editor and at that point you just made 10 variations of the ads what used to take you probably five days of time and uh we'll say you know I mean I think on Billow they charge for a 30 second clip it's now like $80 that AI Avatar just did that for you so you just cut your costs uh so we'll say 500 we'll say it probably cost you like $500 to get one of those ads created and you did 10 of them so you just save yourself five grand and so basically what you could do and I think there's two probably options here one is an agency that's doing this so building these ads out you these ugc ads all the company has to do is just provide you the background images and photos and then you just basically like yo we'll make you unlimited content and you test all of these variations and formats I was just telling you I talked to Desmond uh who's this like just kid building these social apps or sorry these consumer apps um and all their acquisition is entirely through this process of like building out content like this so his whole strategies you do you just find Frameworks that are already working you have those Frameworks and then you just like fill in your content into those Frameworks right so this storytelling Arc great one like finding a meme template that everybody's using another great one Etc and so you just use those same Frameworks over and over again for the same clients but the difference is that logistically what used to take you whatever again like 20 emails and hours of time to get the creative back from a a ugc Creator you now can literally get that made in 30 seconds right and I think that there's a huge opportunity for this like right now this is a massive Arbitrage both to build out ads at scale imagine taking you know 100 different ad variations right running those as Facebook ads with to an all Facebook match to a conversion event like you're GNA be able to identify a winning ad out out of all those uh uh permutations so quickly so effectively so I think that's component of this the other side is you take that same content and if you're doing it right this will get organic views on these social accounts so you go and post these across social accounts so get like five different burner phones and you set this up if you're doing this for your own app and you're trying to figure out how to scale this you get like Sims for each of them or you don't get a sim and you just connect to Wi-Fi and then you've just published directly to reals to this for you page content so I think that there's a larger wave that's happening ugc everybody's trying to figure out how to make this is a really effective ad format but what you can do is you can use these AI tools because they're now good enough for the first time that when you do this style where it's again like an AI talking head Avatar over a backdrop of something like they're talking about what's behind them almost in that like news style Tik Tok format uh you can it's good enough that it will actually like provide value get views Etc so anyway that's idea number one sh don't tell anyone but I've got 30 plus startup ideas that could make you Millions and I'm giving them away for free these aren't just random guesses they're validated Concepts from entrepreneurs who built hundred million plus businesses I've compiled them into one simple database compiled from hundreds of conversations I've had on my podcast but the main thing is most of these ideas don't need a single investor some cost nothing nothing to start I'm pretty much handing you a cheat sheet the idea bank is your startup shortcut just click below to get access your next cash flowing business is waiting for you I don't know if people realize how important finding a winning ad is can you just explain to people why that's like 90% of it yeah th% yeah especially so okay so you know early stage companies right like so often they go in and you know the founder turns on ads I've literally I've audited like hundreds of ads accounts doing this they turn on ads they have no idea what they're doing and they just are like spending money and it's it's creating no impact no results so good ads the whole like and I I don't know why people get so hung up on this developers just like I feel like it's such a a hurdle for them to like get over this idea a good ad when it's running appropriately I put a dollar in and $5 comes out right so every dollar of AD spend that I I put in it turns into $5 of Revenue or customer lifetime value or whatever that ends up being depending on your product type when you look at e-commerce this is literally the game that like this is how e-commerce companies build their existence how they like grow ex like traditionally Etc so if you're trying to identify a winning ad what it typically comes down to is you do what I call a through z testing instead of AB like one you know one ad versus another ad I'm doing a hundred different ads simultaneously I'm doing all these different permutations all these different variations and then I'm just going to look at the data and be like oh hey these three ads out of the hundred that I tested they're getting cpcs at on10th the cost as the rest as the average okay well what do they have in common all right they have all of these exact you know like things in common or they're maybe like positioning the product in a different way so immediately what I'm going to go is I'm going to go build out another hundred different variations based off of this insight and what you're going to identify is you can get this down to where what your average cost was you can probably get it down to about 1% of that now when you think about that iteration process that used to include people right like you would have people in that Logistics so I mean it could be days to get these out and now I can literally do these in like minutes I can get these variations out the door so what this translates into is you can basically optimize your campaign PS more effectively and so with the limited ad budget that you have so say again you have whatever $10,000 a month that you can spend if you optimize an ad from a dollar per click down to 10 cents per click you just 10x that budget impact so again if you say you're getting one you know uh two $2 in a row as off of that $10,000 that means that you're only making 20 grand off of spending uh 10 grand but if I can get that down to 10 cents per click in comparison that means that I can take that up to 200k or sorry I can take that up to 100K for that 10K that I'm spending so that's the component of this and then the bigger thing here is that Facebook and all of these platforms they've gotten so intelligent that they know the ads to show to which people to get conversions to happen so you turn on the conversion event and if you spend enough money and run enough ad variations they're going to identify for you automatically this ad is going to make the most money for you for the ad spend that for the action or for whatever it is that you're trying to accomplish and so then your job is as a Creator as an ad you know ad specialist is just make as many different variations of these ad creatives as possible and again what we're talking about here is a a new paradigm a new way to make these ads at scale that previously was just impossible right like the just the scale that you would need you just have to raise money and I think that this is like an opportunity a massive opportunity both if you're a company right now that's starting out out and you're just beginning and you're like all right how do we figure out ads or if you're uh you know an established company that you know traditionally has used a ton of creators to create uh these these pieces of content for you so such good Alpha like changes how I think about so much um because there's just so much stuff you can incubate on the you know the agency piece I think is is interesting like it's a it's a very like okay how do I get to 10 50 100K a month of R but you know the real goats here are going to be just using this strategy to you know incubate their own stuff and use that you know um dude imagine imagine you're a wedding company right and you're like AI Avatar it's like I went to this wedding recently and they have the cutest plates right they were custom done blah blah blah like it's going to feel like organic social like somebody is literally telling a story of what happened in their life that ad will literally print money for like a custom you know company or whatever custom wedding goods company or something like that um I think that if when again with all of this marketing though like all this Arbitrage is is is fleeting this is not going to work two years from now this is not going to work a year from now you have this moment to run this Gauntlet and entire companies can be built on on the backs of this just because you can optimize this at a volume and a scale that previously wasn't possible Right like again like you you wanted to make a thousand different ad variations and get all those different takes like we're talking hundreds of thousands of dollars right like literally that's what it was I can do that now in a weekend with $99 or subscriptions of $99 to haen and a subscription to chat GPT and a subscription to descript so 150 like that is literally what just is is occurring in this moment and I want people to understand like again this is what is what what is on the Forefront like what we're seeing on the front lines from you know being in that you know applying all of this daily there there's quite literally children doing this oh it's insane yeah it's insane I I they're doing it better than the like the old heads in my opinion that's why I'm down here and I'm like in these [ __ ] Discord channels like you know talking to these groms because they're ripping man like you know I come from an action sports background and like every 10 years you just get Absolut like you're like the things you thought were possible like your your worldview changes where you're literally having a moment like that right now it is the most insane thing I've ever seen and it's all of these kids that are like 20 and degenerate and they're just like doing it out of their dorm rooms or they're like parents basement because they just think it's fun you know and you take that same like ideology and mentality and level that up into like a traditional organization I mean you're going to be so far ahead of your competition like think about Ecom you know like and all this that they're doing if you're telling me like why did Donald Trump win the election all right he did more variations of ads than Hillary did this is like data that is public from 2016 you're telling me that I can sway the American voter think about that apply to a small scale with just like an e-commerce company and competing against another like if I make 10,000 variations of ads and you only make a 100 I guarantee I'm going to beat you I guarantee I'm going to win if I have more bats than you do on those ad variations so dude first of all we're gonna get to idea number two but before we do I just love when your heart rate gets to like the 160 to 190 range it literally feeds Loop because it like freaking like it it it it you know beeps at me it's like yo you're too like your your blood pressure is too high and I'm like I quit eating sodium how is it too hot all right idea number two what do we got so idea number two um this is the larger idea here is AI X and or generator so stumbled on all these keywords lately um so basically like people that are trying to use Ai and then like some type of generator tool so the example the specific example I'm going to give you today and the reason I'm going to do it is because I'm in public going to prove that this is a business and put it on my YouTube channel so this is my call to action for you go sub to my YouTube Channel right now if you want to see me prove that this is a is a company so the idea is AI infographic generator this is the example 9,000 searches per month Greg 9,000 I got the exact match domain AI infographic generator.com for $10 that's how early we are with all of this okay like that is where we are in this cycle it's not even it it's just beginning people are like it's you know this is hype I'm like no like literally you have like family fortunes that can be generated in the next five years with this type work so the idea behind this and the larger thing is you they AI is incredible at taking unstructured data and structuring it so with like the AI infographic generator why this is a great idea and like a great tool is because I can give it a blog post I have a predefined template outline for it to like fill the gaps in and I'm like hey I need a like list five key takeaways from this blog post it does that then write five different paragraphs it does that now generate me five different images that are related to that and do it in this color spectrum here's the hex codes that are that you know are specific to it and this applied to like any category like you know any type of marketing activity that's a regular activity for like generating some type of visual I think is going to be an absolutely massive opportunity for people to get into especially when you're doing these like tools that are very finite scope right like we're going to build this thing out and it's going to get Revenue in the first month I guarantee it and the reason is because people are just trying like they're what used to take a lot of time building a graphic if I can give this thing to them and have ai again take that unstructured and make it structured that they're GNA pay money for that right a thousand percent so and I think that this is the difference I'm not inventing something new I'm taking an old thing that people have done for forever and I'm just remixing it and all of these ideas I think that you know we were talking about this right before we started recording but I think there's a huge opportunity to basically disrupt all of the apps that came previously with this like new AI technology and a perfect example of this is like in a category like nutrition huge category in the like like you know the mobile app space right now there's probably a massive opportunity to combine a nutrition AI app and also do that type of content that we were just talking about the ugc AI Avatar generated content at scale and combine those two things together and you literally like you just like probably can cannibalize a huge industry that you already know is proof and exists and you have the free distribution mechanism on top of that pair those two things together I mean you're going to build a massive company but I think that the the the main takeaway the key idea here is like don't try to invent anything new don't try to change anything that people are doing just take the thing that they're doing and you're going to save them time and save them money by offering whatever this like longtail like solution is so so I love this idea infographics as a service is already proven so J 3 for example I don't know if you know them but they I don't know them like they're they're like an OG infographics agency I think they do they do like millions of dollars a year why people pay for infographics is because a tweet with no infographic versus a tweet with infographic 10 times out of 10 the Tweet within an infographic is going to hit harder which means more distribution which means more eyeballs which means more sales so Brands understand that infographics uh sell and they especially sell in B2B where budgets are bigger so this is and the fact that you were able to get this domain like that was a gift from God I have 20 of these and guess what I'm going to throw 10 links back back at this and I'm going to get it to rank for AI infographic generator because it's an exact match domain so all of it's going to just be organic funnel you don't need a 401k I don't know if I I don't even know man like I don't know what I'm doing anymore but I that like for the first time in a while it's just like very clear what the path is yeah like locked in this is it you know the next 10 years of my life this is all I'm going to be doing basically this and trying to ski as much deep powder as I can sounds like a good life to me okay I like this idea what do you got next yeah so next one um this one is is smaller from a trend standpoint but I think that it's a very interesting idea and it's a larger Trend that's happening where people like they want to just basically record and I think this is really what like friend was arguing so sorry this is actually not the smaller smaller one of the ones I'm going to talk about this one is actually way bigger so 8,100 searches a month AI journaling going absolutely ballistic and So based off of the searches and what is ranking currently and what people are looking for they basically want a phone application that they can just speak into and it records that and then transcribes it and then maybe it does summaries or it looks for insights and then also it has like some tracking Habit to it of like hey I'm I'm journaling daily right so like I made one submission daily and then the other component that it looks like people want on the top of it is the ability to basically go and query against that like all that information so it's like they can pull back you know these These Memories Etc whatever that is um again everything we're talking about here I think this is this whole thing could be just a ugc type content play across organic social same acquisition Channel as all the other ones um but I I I think that this idea of like people wanting to just like brain dump information and then have the AI organize it for them and and bring that back and then incorporate that g you know um that gaming functionality because a lot of these people are like self-help people or they're trying to like make a change it's like a habit tracking app there's a a mechanism for that and I think that you can tap into this piece and use it's like a totally new way to do journaling right like imagine if like everything that you've ever written you could query against or everything you've ever thought like day after day you could query against and be like yo on August 20th of last year what happened that day right and there's also this probably this mechanism to go and then you like write like you know here's this whole like a a year just how Google does like the year and uh uh like a recap of a year you could do that exact same thing but like with all of your notes that are stored within this thing um yeah man curious your thoughts and then I'll talk about acquisition like how I would go about getting users on this even deeper quick ad break let me tell you about a business I invested in it's called boring marketing.com so a few years ago I met this group of people that were some of the best SEO experts in the world they were behind getting some of the biggest companies found on Google and the secret sauce is they've got a set of technology and AI that could help you outrank your competition so for my own businesses I wanted that I didn't want to have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I didn't want to depend on ads to drive customers to my businesses I wanted to rank high in Google gole that's why I like SEO and that's why I use boring marketing.com and that's why I invested in it they're so confident in their approach that they offer a 30-day Sprint with 100% money back guarantee who does that nowadays so check it out highly recommend boring marketing.com so I I'm not going to name drop his app but I've got a buddy who's been running a journaling app that has been doing at least 500,000 of profit a year for the last eight nine years so it's just been like running on autopilot he has a full-time job and this thing is just kind of running on autopilot uh I don't know I think it costs like $20 a year $30 a year um and one of the reasons why I like journaling as a category is it's very similar to website Builders when you use Squarespace to build your website um once your website is built you're not going to like move it to something else even if Squarespace sucks it's just you're going to pay whatever it cost every single month to host with Squarespace your stuff's already there and the same is true with journaling um it's super retentive um so the fact that there this doesn't exist is or this isn't pop like this is an opportunity no question I just think it's an opportunity I I bet there's stuff out there and like we I've seen some but there hasn't been one that's taken over this category yet for this younger generation and I think you could R you could basically be with them for the next 10 years right and you know I always try to think about businesses like in this format of it's something I learned from the beauty space like they try to get people at a young age um because they know that they'll use that product for the next 40 years so like they're very willing to pay a high customer acquisition cost because they know that that payout will happen over the next whatever 40 Years of them using the product and I think there's the same thing to your point with this type of app it's very intimate it's very like you're not going to Port this data out you're just going to keep it running in the background especially if it's like five bucks a month for me to be able to have all of this uh history and all this knowledge you know stored with there um one thing I want to piggyback off of what you said too like so to go back to the AI infographic generator um there was tons that we found that were oneoff solution like oneoff moments in time that people would use this so an example of this would be like AI logo generation like people don't make logos for their companies every month right but they do make infographics for their companies every month so when you're thinking about these products to build try to incorporate that into your philosophy and your framework like I'm looking for something that people do as like a lifestyle Choice like this is a activity that happens on a Cadence either it's daily monthly weekly and the only products and like this is the filter we use ex exclusively like the only products we build are the ones that that is occurring where that that thatth that seasonality is happening if it's if it's a one-time thing like again another one like business plan generator that I don't want to touch that right because it's it's it's a oneandone thing which become it's a very hard type of business uh to because you're always having to fill top a funnel if you're very good at that it's a different you know story different question um are you know different challenges but again the the businesses that I think and what people want to buy as well when you want to exit these things are things that have recurring income or recurring Revenue uh that you know again have in on that Cadence so anyway I just want to throw that in there as well because I think it's important yeah I think uh I wish I knew that earlier in my career you know I'd spend like so much time building an app and then realize that the use cases once every six months when you're coming up with startup ideas prioritize it by how often are people going to use this product th% a thousand perc and like can I make this a part of their like daily routine right their weekly routine um if you can figure out how to do that I mean like this is actually something that's stolen from toothpaste they made they basically like brainwashed and propagandized a generation to think that like okay this is a part of my daily process this is a part of my daily routine and that's actually when they saw uh um Revenue Skyrock rocket and like toothpaste as a category explode is when they they positioned it as this um it was an outcome that you could have they basically related it to like you want pearly white teeth like the movie stars who all had veneers use toothpaste to do that and then also making it a daily Cadence that happens something that's you you know a part of their their daily processing systems just take that same concept apply it into the products that you're building so so so wait am am I not supposed to brush my teeth with toothpaste twice a day you don't actually need to technically and this is like disputed by everybody um it's changed a lot though since our diet has increased with the amount of su Sugar consumption from my understanding I only know this because uh my uh mom side of the family is in the medical space uh in that whole world and you know these long ridiculous longevity doctors that are like doping people up with NAD and ketamine to make them live longer it's [ __ ] insane um but kind of gangster at the same time but anyways long story short the the uh because we do so much sugar consumption it's actually like uh we need to like brush our teeth regularly but you don't actually need toothpaste to have like good tooth Health uh in reality is what it looks like again this is something that's disputed this is just based off of the knowledge and the data that I know of people that are way smarter than me so come for the startup ideas stay for the dental hygiene tips big toothpaste is sell on your ass all right don't get me started on big sunscreen can I just real quick while we're on the the subject of toothpaste and then we can get into how you'd grow this idea have you seen the toothpaste that's a cube no but that packaging is probably fascinating it's time to be better it's called bite it's time sorry it's time to brush better clean up your routine with toothpast bit toothpaste bits no plastic No harsh chemicals just a better way to brush your teeth see this how smart is this that's so smart and it's taking off believe it and I think this would be perfect on Tik Tok shop by the way um it's a novel thing that could easily go viral I'm about to release an episode on the podcast interviewing the dude that's like basically La pioneering this type of like how do I get 2,000 different Tik Tok Affiliates to like post about a product and like zero to one it his whole thing that he told me the entirety of it his name uh I I'll drop it in a second but it basically what what he said to focus on is you have to have like something that people do regularly or is common but it's like very Visual and it's like a different way to do that so for example if it's like a supplement there's like a it's like a you know a a goo tube right that you eat so it's like oh here's the supplement that's like you know what it is like maybe it's for like migraines or some [ __ ] and you have a unique way to to consume that and I think that this is like a prime example of of something that is what people are doing daily but that they could basically uh use like in a novel way they could show it in a novel way so so people listening to this they are charging $32 for toothpaste okay insane I think that this idea around no plastic No harsh chemicals people like clean Living Clean like Google Trends that Living Clean that's like what people want clean is the new healthy so I think that b bite for X like okay how do we break down why this is working it's like a new and interesting format that works for Tik Tok like it's going to go viral on Tik Tok it's clean living and it's like a very very you know modern looking brand in a space that people uh has like a daily a daily uh us right y yeah exact daily Cadence so yep I I think two things there I want to uh like drill deeper down on is one thinking about what is the media before I even make the product so uh his name is Mike Rama who I had on his company is like Brands meet creators and literally all they do is like pair this right like there's a pair of brands that are trying to do this and he's worked with just gangster companies but anyways he like he's more and more he's like yo you got to make a product that is specific for the media channel like it's built so that it's like ticktock right and then on top of that again you're trying to your point like especially with this consumer type stuff how really that's just like top of funnel to get into a repeat purchase right like if you look at Native deodorant and like there's great documentation on this like case study wise like he talks about this in public the co-founder is the the reason he chose the categor is because it's consumable and the best companies for D Toc are consumables right because it's a repeat purchase that happens it's got to have some novelty it's got a bit a a bigger wave to your point that clean like living you're riding that larger wave and you're just taking something that people are already doing and you're you're modifying that you're remixing that and those are the best types of DDC Brands it's very hard to do a close brand where somebody just does one purchase and bounce right like it's way easier when it's like cool all we do is sell toothpaste and every month you're going to buy toothpaste from us or every two weeks you're gonna you know or whatever every two months you're gonna buy toothpaste from us because it Cates it creates a Cadence it creates a a future revenues that you know are going to happen so going back to AI journaling how would you grow that thing yeah so tons of longtail keywords related to AI journaling um I think I would go after all of those uh the I think the bigger opportunity probably though is there's tons uh there's a whole sub you like YouTube ER like subculture around journaling it's like journaling Aesthetics and journal like it's they like they almost use the it's like a you know it's like book talk it's like it's like you know one of these subg genres that you just don't know exists I would reach out to every one of them go and scrape their emails from uh YouTube and be like hey I want to do a sponsored post with you and have them literally just like demo the app pitch the app and that's probably your whole your whole strategy and then do an affiliate commission with them so structurally what you do is come in and be like hey we're going to pay 200 a video I want to get three videos out of you to start with and then we're gonna also give you a 20% to 30% you know fil it commission whatever makes sense for the brand and so what you're going going to do is you're going to get lock in with them because they want to continue to promote this thing because they're seeing this re monthly Revenue that's coming off of it and then if they actually get sales happen you typically like people don't buy a lot of the times from what we've seen datawise off of one video that a Creator makes it's actually off of like three videos it's because there's like more trust built into that they like you know if somebody talks about it like three times they're way more they're way more close uh or way more likely to make that purchasing decision and so that's how you know you can create this symbiotic relationship between you and the Creator and I think I would just go ham on that I think you could just do that channel entirely probably there and then do the same thing on Tik Tok and and Instagram from a um a Creator uh uh sponsorship standpoint so beautiful cool yeah and and let us know in the comment section like some competitors to this I'm actually curious um obviously people are doing AI journaling but yeah I think that it's probably AI journaling for XYZ uh is like probably the idea so thinking about who who the customer is um who who the community is um but this is this is a good idea um what's your next what's your next idea yeah so this one I don't have data on but I just am seeing this and we're doing this and I just want to get it out in public more because I think it's a huge opportunity so like creators don't really make a lot of money like actually like they make a living but it's like it's very hard to do extremely well but I think that they're approaching it in a wrong like the incorrect way and what I'm seeing these like kind of early sign that there's an opportunity for is like this new Creator business model so what this looks like is you basically figure out how to game short form and that's just like go as broad as you can top of funnel right pick some category do that you get them into a lead magnet so that lead magnet is some type of downloadable asset that's super valuable to that same audience that lead magnet is then the way that you do email collection to build it out an email newsletter and then you do long form YouTube videos that are deeper dives into whatever your short forms are and then you combine the email newsletter as a way to promote the long form video and why you're doing the long form video like why do you do this podcast Greg is because you can have like six different mid roll ads throughout it right and if say for example you're doing business content average RPM so views or Revenue per thousand views is about like five to7 depending and so if you can get you know these ads occur more often Within These longer form videos you can actually make like decent money off of this right for with it depending on the category that you're in so I think that's a component I think the layer the other piece of this is you can do brand deals right as a monetization but the bigger play is this email newsletter and there's this natural uh funnel that happens there and it's there's a flywheel that starts to like go to basically to be able to grow this email newsletter so you have that top of funnel with the lead magnet side but also every time that you're promoting this YouTube video you're also going to have a call to action to go sub and there's going to be percentages of people that start to discover those videos on YouTube you're getting paid so the revenue is coming from YouTube you're getting paid from the brand deals you're also getting more subs to happen to the newsletter and then you're selling ads on the newsletter and you're selling ads on the YouTube video and so when I think about that like that's a really brilliant business model but let's scale that up even further let's do that with five channels let's do that with 10 different YouTube channels same formula I pick a category business I take a I pick a category content marketing I pick a category email marketing whatever that is and all I do is content related to that top of funnel down to uh you know that ebook Channel That's dedicated to it entirely specific do that flywheel like I think that this is like a half you know this is a three qus of a million to a million dollar a year type of company that I think that these creators can run and I can think you could probably do it with like a team of like maybe two or three Vas and you know one and a video editor that's like doing all the the long format video editing and I think you could absolutely crush it and this this to me is like the new the business model then you go sell Community you know you run you run the Greg Playbook sell access to a community um and then the other piece is like that Community is basically the inception for what products you should build for that audience right because they're going to talk about their problems they're L they're literally paying you to tell you what product you should build them like that's what's happening here right but the value that's added is because they're in a group of like-minded people that like have are trying to solve all these issues together right and I think that if you did that like multiple channels like pathway I think there's a huge business opportunity like that to me is the actually the Creator business model that is the path to get to this really uh you know profitable uh kind of you Creator style business you know how I feel about this this is like this is top of mind for me um I actually I I only have one ad for my podcast sometimes a lot of times I have no ad so I'm I'm doing a horrible job at monetizing my my podcast but um my belief is like build the audience and then sort of you know if you give enough value at some point people want to work with you in some ways Greg's just Facebooking you I want you to know that every person that's listening to this all right he's about to Zuck you all right and that is what is really going down here okay I'll do a quick plug while you know I never do these plugs so here's the plugs if you want to work with Greg Eisenberg and and our companies here are some places here's some ways you can do it if you need a dope app you need a figure out AI you need a website late checkout. agency although we're very expensive but it is literally the best team on the planet to go do it uh engineering you know build zero to1 lay check. agency boring marketing.com AI assisted SEO boring ads.com ads and AI to ads those are some plugs for today thanks for that opportunity thanks for listening but yeah you're right no this this idea is is going to play out in quite literally tens of thousands of different niches and there's there's room like this is a good opportunity for people who also don't want to work in really big teams thousand per yeah if you just want to like this is like a different play for solopreneurship right like it's like and it and it's and it's like you can make good money doing that combining all those things but what I see so many creators do is they just focus on one of these components right like they're just like focusing on short form and then it's just like you're it's just what deals can you secure that's super super hard to do sustainably right and to not burn out but if you're like getting all of these different monetization checkpoints like you know throughout this whole process also that's an asset that people want to buy right like if you have an email newsletter with like 100,000 Subs on it and like good open rates and like it's a very specific audience right like we're like you know whatever every heads every head of growth in the US is on that email newsletter like that thing is worth millions of dollars especially if they're like tuning into it on a weekly basis and watching your thing stuff right oh not only that it's pretty liquid so the good news about newsletters is people know what a subscriber is worth and people who buy newsletters know what a subscriber is worth so you can sell it relatively quickly um it's almost like real estate right like of course you can sell real estate tomorrow sometimes it takes time but you know there's intrinsic value to real estate just like there's intrinsic value to newsletters th% and I think that that's something that like again this so we're doing this for creators this is my [ __ ] called action for anybody that's listening if you want to do this and you're making great long form YouTube content and there's a specific Niche that you're like going after and you're seeing success in reach out to me we're really excited to work with you what we do is we basically take that long form content we use that as Source material and then we write and manage newsletters for you and grow those for you so we basically handle that whole component it it creates this like growth flywheel where your channel grows faster but also creates this other way for you to do uh basically like Revenue generation for whatever this thing is that you're building and probably what this evolves into is we'll handle the sales of like ad sales as we build out this network so anyways I want to work with you reach out to me let's do one last idea dude there's too many man I know you got to jump but it's um let me uh let me go find my my favorite one um all right cool I want to do I want to do this one so AI receptionist have you seen this data yet no I haven't oh my God I'm so excited to show you this you're gonna just freak out Greg you're gonna freak out because you know what this means look at this absolutely crazy right so early early days the kicker though the thing that's more wild with this is that people are searching for longtail versions of this so like AI receptionists for dentists AI receptionists for you know whatever category right so what is this and why is this happening it's getting and so my brother works in the medical space so I have like Insider knowledge on this it's getting harder and harder to hire like just front desk people that just like answer questions and we're I'm like working with the company right now that um uh we're doing some growth for them that is like one of these tools that's like specific like Niche down and the receptiveness that people have to this is just like insane because there is just literally no like they can't hire people to do these roles and so what these are so an AI receptionist that's trained off of your data and can have a conversation with the person that's calling because a lot of the times it's the same questions over and over again imagine you just create like a PDF of like the information and then it's just like answering questions when people call and then the thing that's people are doing that's going further is then they're plugging into the crms of the companies so that like say for example like they want to schedule an appointment they can schedule that through that and I think the thing here that people need to think about is like these receptionists already exist and the outcomes and then really just like the uh how effective they are is lower than what these tools are starting to get to like from a quality standpoint point so you're doing it at a cheaper cost more effectively of course you're going to win of course there's going to be a massive opportunity in this space and the latency now is getting so low that when you call these things it's becoming just like so like responsive that it's actually a good experience right it's better than it would be like you know calling uh a human at times especially since they're more knowledgeable so I'm curious your thoughts here and I know you have a ton about like you been talking about this in particular about like the chat and like how chat interfaces like voice you know chat interfaces with AI or like this new product uh category but I'm curious where your head's at through the lay checkout agency I've been able to just to pipe in on a lot of this thinking around how to how this next wave of AI software is sort of replacing labor and receptionists is one of the first places there's a have you heard of vapi no I haven't so so basically uh I mean you can use open AI voice stuff but a lot of people are using this it's a way to it's an API to manage inbound calls and outbound calls so like they you know they show here like Barber Shop availability bookings and queries dentist office schedule appointments patient FAQs restaurants SAS websites realtor offices you can even do outbound calls like qualifying leads debt collection like how like amazing right so I'm literally texting this to my brother as we talk about this because their big thing that they're trying to figure out is how do we do collections of payments that people owe like the clinics right so it's like basically how do I outbound call you know a thousand people that all owe money totally so this is a game Cher and I think it's going to transform businesses we're already sort of thinking about this and and think you know in a lot of ways selling this to to clients from our agency but you can go and build um and they've gotone and raise like 20 30 million bucks um I think what they're doing is really interesting and you can just you could just build this and build a wrap around it and sell it to like start like cold calling your local dentist office and start selling it straight up straight up you know don't reinvent the wheel people don't reinvent the wheel that's the biggest thing if you can take anything away from this conversation today it's that it's like don't be creative find a category that has existed for forever and will exist for forever and then just go and do something in that space that there's like you know an opportunity to remix now that this new technology has entered the market has entered the field play so yeah yeah I think it's tap into things that are validated there's a moment in time right now with a lot a lot of consumer interest around things like AI um there's new llms and new apis that didn't exist a few years ago that you can build on top of uh and and just experiment have fun with it th% th% so that's it man I know you need to jump thank you for hosting as always Cody it's been real um folks comment like this if you enjoyed Cody you know if you have distribution questions literally I will answer them comment what they are and I will make videos about them in public so there you go so take take him up on the offer why not dude I'll see you next time thanks again for coming coming on thanks as always G always a pleasure we'll talk to you soon later [Music]

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
you are in for a treat this guy has a platform for you to create AI employees thousands of them that are running that could help you build your startup not enough people are talking about this just a it's a really easy way to create agents and he's the CEO he's the founder um he just walks us through his brain all the best practices you're going to want to watch this entire episode especially wait for the end it blows your mind uh I can't wait to see what you build [Music] enjoy so I sent Flo a message and I said hey I want to create a team full of AI employees can you help me figure out how to do that and you said you know what I'll share it with everyone so here you are yeah yeah thanks for having me Greg yeah happy happy to jam and show how how this works cool so while you're pulling that up just tell people what's happening in the world that allows you to be able to do this and why they should actually care about creating AI team members and AI automations yeah uh why you should care I just think it's thousand times better than a human uh and and it's it's just it's G to make your business more efficient it's going to make you make you grow faster uh it's easier to spin up you don't have to manage it you don't it scales infinitely like it's like elastic so like it scales up with the volume of demand and uh scales down if you don't use it uh it just continuously improves it's it's yeah it's just incredible what's happening right now in the world like people are realizing and I guess they realized that perhaps a year and a half ago with agents but I don't know if everyone yet really understands what's happening like llms are not just good to like generate text you know generate copy or whatnot like it turns out llms like gp4 cloud and all of that can actually do work for you and so that's I think it why does it matter it makes a huge difference in your business I think the the business of the future is basically you can set up a a team of 5,000 AI employees in like in a weekend and that's what we're going to do today we're GNA do a live cooking session you're G to share your screen you're going to show up how to actually do it so without further Ado Flo take yeah I guess I'll start with the end like I'll start with I'll just show my Lindy account so this is Lindy this is what it looks like uh I have a bunch of lindies here on the left uh this is very unfiltered this is literally what I do like and this is this is how my Lindy account looks like by the way Flo do you mind just zooming in a little bit yeah for sure thank there you go yeah perfect so like the one Lindy I'm currently looking at is my meeting recorder India I can't live without it to just Jo Jo all my meetings uh it's a bit of a crazy one there's like a lot of a lot going on here but at a high level it's it's pretty simple it's like okay when a calendar event begins you join the meeting you record it um and then when you've got the meeting you create a Google doc with the meeting notes you send me the notes by slack you send me coaching notes that's pretty cool I've like um I've prompted this Lindy here you can see the prompt right here uh for for the kind of coaching I want so it's like was I too confrontational I'm French so I have to uh look out for that or not confrontational enough did I not double click into an issue but you can basically give any prompt you want at any step of these AI agents so it sends me coaching notes and then it it goes on on slack and it looks for uh channels in which to disseminate the notes um so the the interesting thing here is so for example the coaching noes here you can see um it it keeps going after it sends the coaching noes and also sends the notes to the team on slack but then if I reply to the email you can see this Branch here that goes after reply received it picks up the workflow back at that point and it's an agent so like it it it's got the entire context in mind and so it can it can uh take the context into account uh as it uh uh uh takes this email that I just replied I'll give a very concrete example so I received this feedback from Lindy uh a few months ago actually I was on a call with a customer and she gave me the feedback in her coaching she was like I thought your explanation was too Technical and so I was able to reply and I was like why did you find too technical about my explanation and she replied back and again this is the part where it's an AI agent with the entire context in it context window and H here I'm doing it again she was like ah you said context window hopefully everyone understands what it means now but the agent basically was in the meeting and it sees my question my follow-up question but it's questioning from the beginning and it sees the feedback it sent me initially so it's it's really this sort of long living intelligent agent that's actually performing tasks and understanding the tasks that it's performing and that's and that's why you know I saw on Twitter someone someone say isn't this just zapier and so the difference between zapier which is automations in this is there's intelligence correct yeah there's a huge difference between an automation on the one hand which is what zapier is really good at and an agent on the other hand right and so yes I think the the two biggest difference are going to be that one um you can use AI at any point in Lindy so I'll give a super concrete example like I I have some investment properties in France which is terrible financial decision um and I I I received these confirmation emails I've put them on like the French Airbnb and so I Reed this confirmation emails it's like hey you just made 200 bucks because you you rented your place on on holyo and I have a Lindy right here what she does does is okay when I receive an email which is a reservation confirmation you go to these Google Sheets and you pend the ru to the Google sheet and you can see here the sales each sale is a prompt so I was like okay please extract from the email the day of the reservation extract the total amount of the reservation and you'll notice I don't have to at any point inject data from a previous step like in Z here each step is an island it's isolated here it's an agent it's an agent that is aware of the entire context of everything it did and so if you want to do this with zapo you're going to have to write like an HTML Pur you may not be able to do it it's going to be hard it's gonna be brittle it's gonna break the moment the HTML format changes here I can just speak to my agent and I can be like all right please extract the number of Travelers of the reservation from the email right it just works um sh don't tell anyone but I've got 30 plus startup ideas that could make you millions and I'm giving them away for free these aren't just random guesses they're validated Concepts from entrepreneurs who built 100 million plus businesses I've compiled them into one simple database compiled from hundreds of conversations I've had on my podcast but the main thing is most of these ideas don't need a single investor some cost nothing to start I'm pretty much handing you cheat sheet the idea bank is your startup shortcut just click below to get access your next cash flowing business is waiting for you so that's the difference number one is this concept of having these AI prompts anywhere in any field of any action difference number two is is this concept I just mentioned of um the fact that it's a zap is a thing that's like once and done a Lindy agent manages longterm tasks on like long time Horizons and so again that means that you can have a conversation with your agent whether it's by email like that's the example I just gave or by slack we have this other Lindy that um joins sales calls and then post the summary of the call in a slack Channel that's called custom Discovery and then it's really handy because again I can then go in the slack uh thread and ask follow-up questions to it so here you can see she is funny actually a question that this customer asked was like how do I make L slower right because he he he wanted her to seem more human um and so I can just follow up in the in the thread and I'm like oh what did we reply to this questions I'm curious and boom it's like this is the reply to the question and here I can coach the teammate who was in this uh meeting like in context in right here in slack so yeah those are really the two differences it's like AI everywhere and like long Leed workflows okay and so I'm loving this by the way I'm loving this but where my mind is at is great flow you're really good at designing these really smart kind of workflows these AI you know agents how do I get started like how do I know where to start how do I design it like that to me is a really really important step that I think a lot of people are going to miss including myself no 100% there is there is a little bit of a learning curve but you know you mentioned zap you mention you mentioned make like I think the the the folks here who listen to us I mean most of them are pretty tinkery they can figure it out we have like a Lindy Academy we have like a bunch of templates on the store but yeah I mean let me let me just show you I'll create the Lindy right now just to to give you an example um I'm gonna create a new Lindy and I'm gonna make it so that she um what's an example of the thing I want to do I want to when I receive an email that is very time sensitive uh I want that ly to ping me on slack for example and so I'm going to go um Gmail it's just the trigger when I receive an email I'm going to create a condition it's again that's what I mean by like it's AI throughout so right here I'm like uh the condition is just natural language so go down this path if this email is urgent and time sensitive okay it's really that simple it's like a small prompt and here what I'm going to do is okay at that point you Slack you send me a direct message okay the user I'm going to enter my own email here but even if I didn't do that it would would probably still infill that I wanted to message me and here I can enter a prompt and I'm going to be like um send me a message about this time sensitive email I just received um with context about it and again that's what I mean it's like every step is aware of what's the ca saying it's like a it's it's aware of everything that came before it and the context in which it exists um it's it's it's aware of every other step that existed before you can see the output of every other step that existed before um this is really pretty much it I'm I'm Gonna Save this and wait sorry how do how does it know that it's time sensitive that's an llm it's just so at any step you can decide which llm Powers the step and so here it's Cloud 3.5 Sonet that's our default it does like an excellent job most of the time and so it's basically the equivalent of taking the email pasting it in chat GPT or cloud and asking it is this time sensitive cool so basically artificial intelligence basically yeah exactly and so here I'm gonna call this the sensitive time sensitive email uh catcher or modifier right um and so now I'm going to send myself an email FL at Urgent hey Flo this is urgent uh can you please give me a call back as app okay and okay I I should let me let's let's wait and see what happens here uh all right so I am I'm just checking if I've everything is perfectly well set up why do I have I already received an email about Elan musk and I don't I don't want to know what it is all right boom so here you can see it received the email it's going to go through the condition this email is ENT and time sensitive and now it is sending me a select message boom urgent email received you just received an email fromo subject urgent hlow this appears to be a time sensitive matter requiring your mediate detention crazy this is this is a simple example I'm going to make it a bit more complicated and what I'm going to do is I'm going to do after reply received so now I'm going to be able to chat back with this l in my in my slack and I'm going to enter an AI agent so the difference between this steps and an AI agent is like here these steps I am telling Lindy when to do what with any agent I'm I'm telling Lindy you figure it out and so I can give her a prompt for like some guidance about what to figure out and so forth and I can give it skills which are basically actions it can invoke at any point in any sequence and so here the the the skills I'm going to give it suppose for example I want it to be able to reply to the email and I also wanted to be able to uh create a calendar event okay I'll keep it simple F I'll just keep it there I'm not even gonna give it any guidance because I I think it's pretty it's pretty simple at this point like what what it's going to do and I'm going to do a new a new example so flow at l. uh hey Flo can you give me a call back to talk about the Hawaiian pizza oh no this is the first thing comes to my mind boom I think Gmail takes like 30 seconds to send emails because you know you can you can cancel the you can undo all right just received the email oh no this is something else all right this email is urgent and time sensitive and again you can see here this is very unlike the sort of mechanistic automation it's an agent that actually understands the email uh you see here the sender is requesting a call back regarding Hawaiian pizza and now what I'm going to do let me just stop screen sharing real quick and switch to uh my slack um tell him I'll call him right away and create a 15 minute and send him a 15minute calendar invite for 3 p.m. oh maybe it requires maybe it doesn't take the thread reply here I actually kind of like not editing it because it just shows show realistically yeah this is what this is what you're going to run into these are the problems like we're going to troubleshoot it together like people come to other podcasts that are like so so so uh edited here we're like We're In It Together okay uh so I think here what's going on is uh because it is a one-on one message it's sending it as this slack but so I think because of slack API or something like that it can't receive uh the reply so what I did is exactly for this I have a channel that's called like flow and Hindi um and so what I'm going to is I'm going to I'm just going to instead of making it a one-on-one message I'm going to make it a channel message so flow and his Lind um and I'm also going to give it the ability to reply back I I had forgotten to add this skill here and I am gonna do it again ENT hey Flo can you give me a call back this is pretty urgent let's talk about haian pizza all right so it sent me the message in slack and I'm going to tell him um I'll just go back to with the slack but what as the SL but previously so all the stuff that you're doing this is stuff that you would do with a human being like I do this with my e for example exactly yeah well often compared to like an EA I use I use Lindy basically as my EA so here you can see boom she uh she got the she got my message she sent a reply in the in the email so it's like I'll call you right away and I'm setting a calendar invite for 3M today so you can see she again she understands she did not copy paste what I said right I was able to be like tell him I'll call him right away and send him a calendar invite so she replied to the email I can probably see that uh in my inbox kind of don't want to share that but um and and then she replied back on slack and she's like I've sent a reply and created the calendar invite for 3M today with Google me link and I can see that again it's probably where am I it's right here she created a calendar invite and she named it urgent call Hawaiian pizza discussion again it's it's an AI agent it sees everything that just happened it understands I received an email Flo told me to do this it can manage multiple threads you can see here it managed like a slack conversation on one side and like an email conversation on the other side um yeah so that's that's I mean you tell me Greg like I don't know like does this does this seem very complicated I'm actually eager to to hear feedback not really I think for me what I what I'm probably going to do is think about like what are all the jobs to be done like you know the jobs to be done framework um that I need and and that I do repetitively and sort of just like write a list of them and then come into let's say Lindy and just start like kind of me just messing around yeah and I I think exactly the job to be done for work you're nailing it on the head because and this is a more advanced capability but we have the capability to send uh messages to to to have lindes work together so for example suppose this is much more advanced but um I'm going to I'm going to create another step here that's going to be like send a message to another Lind um and let's say that I'm going to create a new Lindy right now that is an expert in creating Google Docs proposals okay it's it's really like it's like object oriented programming for agents um so I'm going to create this uh proposal writer Lindy and so today being summoned byd is basically it's own trigger so you got to create an agent message received trigger because you're basically being summoned by another agent and so what I'm going to do is I'm going to um I am going to perform an action and I'm going to create a Google doc with a proposal so Google Docs creates the document I'm just going to create it in my drive and here I'm going to be like name this uh y y y. mm. DDD proposal for client X replace the fil characters by the actual date I'm going to leave the T just for the of it just to show like this is the Glorious New Era of computing it's like I can talk to it in English and I can talk to it in broken English and just works um and here content is like write a proposal using the instructions that were given to you um yeah like add like multiple sections about pricing and tombs and all that stuff I'll just like in real life you would really flesh out this this prompt depending on the proposal you want to you want to add and now I'm going to get I'm going to get it to talk back to the agent that summoned it so I'm like uh tell the agent you're done and send it the link to the proposal you just created all right I'm Gonna Save this guy I'm G to go back to my other agent and I'm going to tell her you see like the proposal writer only now appears here and I'm going to be like please write a proposal for person X about topic y okay and so here you can see an AI agent is an interesting step because it keeps looping like you give it a goal and then it's like I'm I'm going to keep doing my thing I never really pass the button until something is true so it's almost like a wi Loop and so here I'm going to be like if you have to write a proposal for the client then you just you take this off ramp if you will and here so now he going to do that I'm going to rename this guys like a delegate delegate to proposal writing agent and uh I am gonna so once it receives the reply I'm gonna look back to the agent here and probably is gonna know what to do at this point like okay like got to write a proposal I'm delegating this to this guy this guy's going to write the proposal and then this guy's going to get back to him and then probably like this guy Al gonna like send it okay so um let's do it um I am gonna send a new email so flow at Lindy proposal flow this is urgent can you please send me a proposal as app about the $10,000 saber truck $100,000 saber truck sorry Bo quick ad break let me tell you about a business I invested in it's called boring marketing.com so a few years ago I met this group of people that were some of the best SEO experts in the world they were behind getting some of the biggest companies found on Google and the secret sauce is they've got a set of technology and AI that could help you outrank your competition so for my own businesses I wanted that I didn't want to have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I didn't want to depend on ads to drive customers to my businesses I wanted to rank high in Google that's why I like SEO and that's why I use boring marketing.com and that's why I invested in it they're so confident in their approach that they offer a 30-day Sprint with 100% money back guarantee who does that nowadays so check it out highly recommend boring marketing.com so while that while that's loading sending proposal so I I you know we we co-founded a few agencies and in the agency world sending proposals is one of the biggest bottlenecks yeah so for anyone who who has starting a service business um any level of service business having something like this that sort of just streamlines your proposal process especially for like smaller deals maybe not like your huge Fortune 500 deals but for your smaller deals super helpful yeah yeah um okay so you can see it sent me a slack message as per my instructions this guy wants a proposal I'm like yeah can you go ahead and write a proposal and send it to him please okay now this is interesting so you see it's taking the up ramp it's delegating to that other L just created so I'm going to switch tabs I'm going to go here she received uh this uh message right here oh oh I know what's going on it's because this Lind does not even have a way for me to message her so I'm just going to create that on the side this is a bu on all side I'm just going to create an empty guy right here so this guy is actually alive it's just there a there's like a display bag so it's creating the proposal right now well I'll show you behind the scenes we have this debuger that's not really available to anyone else and I I believe the reason why it's taking a long time is because this is this is going to be a pretty beefy document that it's trying to create which makes sense I mean if you ask someone for someone meaning a human being for a proposal yeah it's not going to take a few seconds you may it may take a minute yeah yeah um I'm going to kick it off again just in case like write another proposal please yeah so this is this is more like the generic message we display like we're experiencing high demand this is not the case just like when when a Tas takes a long time this is this is what we show um boom boom boom where is this sind it's here so you see here it's like spinning up another agent yeah I think this Lindy was tripped up because he did not even have a way to talk to me so it was he was being confused so so while this is loading would you say it's a good idea to start with just like regular Lindy before having like if you're just starting out it's your first time ever EV you know bu doing anything like this start with a regular Lindy and then eventually kind of graduate to the Lindy talking to the Lindy is that yeah 100% like Lindy talking to Lindy is is is is a better it's more experimental it's like a very Advanced uh uh sort of feature yeah so I'm gonna it is it is creating the document right now again it's just taking a very long time so in the debugger we have a little bit more information I can see it's just it's just taking a very long time to create a document because it's it's like a whole it's like a whole proposal and it may even be running out of tokens yeah especially since I told you like hey include a whole section about X like this is probably a bit too ambitious uh at multiple sections about pricing in terms I'll just go like write a short proposal like one page Max using the instructions that we given to you the like working I'll just take a long a long time um we can also move on and I can like go back to this once it's done writing the prop let's do that yeah um what other cases do we have um well so like the meeting schedular is like a very big one again because it keeps this entire context in history what I do is I have this Lindy meeting scheduler this one is actually really simple it's just an AI agent uh and so I gave it uh so in the settings here you can have a global prompt so I just gave it like a very long I just kept adding to this is like hey like always sign your emails with Lindy like um you know if I didn't specify a duration it's 30 minutes and so forth you don't have to do that like we have a template that's very opinionated that's got all of that I live in Lind so like my Lind are very custom by now um and so the way it works is I just um this is an example right here um these guys reached out that like Talent managers they want to try Lindy they're like ah FL can we meet I'm like sure uh Lindy will help us find the time so you can see she looks at my calendar she finds some times she replies back in the thread she's like hey how is Monday at 9:30 or Thursday at 2 pm so she sends a few availabilities um um and then she sends more availabilities at some points they reply and then she sends a calendar invite and that's it and oh look actually this is a good example like this is this was unplanned like this is her playing on hard mode so they changed their mind so she sent her a time and then they're like sorry we're unavailable then can we aim for the following week and so what she did look she deleted the calendar event she looked for more times for the following week uh she sent more times like okay how is this time instead and like Yeah Tuesday on great and boom she sends the new time and that's it um so yeah I mean again that shows if you had to do this with any other automation solution frankly I don't even know how you would do that and like I think this this shows like a pretty good illustration of the difference between uh an Automation and an AI agent do you want to show one while while we're still waiting do you want to show one last use case that people could could use Lindy for I so we're currently looking for this uh designer and so so this one looks very complex but again like once you get the hang of it it's you basically just like add nodes and and branching in conditions right and so what I did here is like okay we're looking for designer I'm going to send you random ass information about designers it could be I spend an embarrassing amount of time on Twitter so like most of the time it's going to be a Twitter link it's like I really like this guy's work I just saw him on Twitter right sometimes it's going to be a portfolio sometimes it's gonna be just a name sometimes it can be anything right and so you can see at the very rout here it's like what did I give you did I give you a website an email address a LinkedIn link and here its job is basically hey and you can see this is why it goes on this like site Quest here there's like multiple branches like find the email address so I have a Google Sheets where like I already log a bunch of email addresses um but if it's not there then there's going to be an AI agent here and again this is the beauty of a agent I'm just giving it a high level goal like browse for a bit if it's a Twitter link maybe it's there look for the portfolio and give up after full attempt like if you've because sometimes AI agents get stuck in a loop they go on like weird like wild goose chases like don't don't try for too long and so I gave it an offramp here we call those exit conditions you give up after in more than full web page contents to that finding an email okay and so super concrete example here um let's see this guy for example so like I said I sent her a Twitter link she's like okay this is a website I'm gonna look into Google Sheets I could not find an email there and then you're in AI agent world I so what she's doing is like she's extracting the Twitter link and she can't find anything on the Twitter link like okay well I'm going to do Google search for this guy followed by designer portfolio I I did not tell it to do that literally my instruction was like browse for a bit I guess you know um then I guess on Google it's finding a behan portfolio couldn't find an email there so basically there is another offramp for the CCI agent here that's like you were able to find an email on one of the pages so basically it just keeps looping that's why there's these blue arrows here uh it just keeps looping until until it finds the email so okay be hands can't find it another be hands can't find it it's basically doing the same as you would do on Google like okay you've got a bunch of search results click click click click is it here is it here is it here oh there's another one here JFR brand and product designer oh this is the same guy you can see it's like the same Twitter handle and I was able to find an email and again beauty of AI it's like his email here I don't even know where it is um but sometimes it's people you know they spell out like do you know Doom in order for like buds not to see them well jokes on them like now it's it's a all over it right and so even if it's like that like sometimes they write like oh my email is my name at gmail well the LM is going to understand that just fine you know so now okay it found the email it's gonna check if I reached that before and it does that by looking at my adbox no I did not reach that before I'm going to send an email and you can see after that it waits and then it sends a bunch of reminders I think I I programmed this one to send like three reminders and then give up but you can you can make it like send as many reminders as you want this you know this gets me thinking that not only could you use Lindy to like make a scalable business on way less employees but couldn't you build a business around Lindy meaning couldn't you create the design recruiter and just like cold call cold email using Lindy um you know say hey like are you looking for designers I'll give you every single day like email three emails of of high quality designers 1,000% so you can see here and again especially once you get your lindies to work together you basically end up like an entire team of of of lindies and yes you you could build that's a vision like you could build an autonomous company with Lindy so you can see here for example I have this like lead generator Lindy right so I'm gonna ask it I want five product designers who work at zapier for example uh I don't want I don't want to help my friends at Z here but um so it's going to gonna kick off the search and I think this one I've asked this Lindy hey once you found people I want you to add them to Google Sheets it's just more convenient for me to like review them there even if he doesn't add them to Google Sheets it's just gonna give me like a mock down table all right so it's giving me Google Sheets now it's gonna talk back to me it's gonna be like I found these people and I guess we're going to see who she found um oh I know I know some of these people uh so I'm going to click on the LinkedIn links right here and I think there's a problem with the scrolling but but I believe I believe there's more information here these are personal no they're like zap here emails which kind of sucks yeah these people director of product design design ad zap here product design ad zap here director of product design product design get up here um I could ask you I'd love to get some is there like an a agent here in the end there is an AI agent the reason I'm checking is because if there isn't an AI agent I can't really chat I can't really continue the conversation because she's basically done here there is any agent like hey did you get any personal emails too this is like a cheat code oh my God I did not even you're you're seeing this as live as I am like I did not even ask her to and again it's beauty of Agents it's like she's like oh yeah sorry I guess I'm gonna I guess I'm gonna update the spreadsheet yes I found personal email I've added them to a spreadsheet with a new column here they are but this one I couldn't find an email address so anyway it's funny that you're offering that as an example like the recruiting company just this morning I was on a call with there is a company right now that's being formed that is creating a recruiting company on top of Lindy and they've created maybe I think this is like almost Advanced use case they have lindes I've never seen anything like that they're really really pushing the limits of the product but yeah I mean in the limit it's going to be one dude well that happen to be two but it's gonna be one dude and an army of AI recruiters and that company can scale infinitely with compute basically it's just with llms right because now I can take this designers I could very well hook up this Lindy to my other Lindy I'll do that right now all right I'm gonna I was gonna ask you that let's do it g get this guy let's see because now I'm okay so this is gonna get even more complicated because now there's a send message of an AI agent there's like a delegation inside another AI agent but and why is she asking me to authenticate I'm all authenticated okay um I don't really want her to send emails to these people though so what I'm going to do this is sweet I'm you know it's like a really live demo uh I am going to do this initial Outreach oh it is all this so you see I have this toggle here that's like ask for confirmation meaning you just show me the email before sending it don't send it immediately okay so I'm gonna go back to this guy and I'm gonna say uh I'm I'm going to do the offr here because I just think it's gonna be like so much more reliable um oh and I guess I think this designer recruited does not have an agent trigger okay so deser recuiter add an agent trigger so now she can be now other lindies can talk to her I'm just gonna hook up this guy right here GNA save him and now I'm gonna go back to my leg gen Lindy and I'm gonna go like it's effectively the same so what I'm doing right now so you see I did this skill here okay another thing I can do is I can create instead an exit condition I like doing that better because it gives me a little bit more control because when I add a skill I have no control over any of the parameters that are passed to this skill and so I'm I'm sort of um I'm I'm praying the llm gods that she'll do the right thing and for some reason designer recruiter is right here and so text I'm going to tell it uh the name of like all the info you have about this designer and I'm going to go right here and so here is like if the user is asking you to reach out to one of the designers all right and now I'm going to go back here and I'm going to tell her uh Rat to chase please so you see she's taking the off framp I just defined she is hitting up my this is cool so she's hitting up my designer recuiter I'm going to go over there and again to me that's that's the business of the future it's just you've got your army of 2,000 Indies on the left and they just do all sorts of stuff stuff all day and you just go and and and look at what they're up to all right so ah she kind of screwed up here because it's like she she says it's a LinkedIn link but in the end it works doesn't matter she's like prospecting again she checks if I've reached that before I have not reached out ah this is so cool so um okay yeah I haven't reached out before and then she's like look she's apologizing for reaching out from to like a professional email sorry for reaching out to your work email in my experience few companies ever really monitor recruiting emails but still that can feel a bit icky um who's Chase do I do I want to hire Chase um yeah why not yeah he looks he looks horrible all right um you know what I'm gonna cons because I I want to reach that to his personal email especially since I have his personal email I should do that um yeah yeah that should does that give you a good idea yeah that was amazing I love that that hilarious cool the uh is the proposal uh finished check on see I'm trading yes it is finished okay so now she wrote this Google duck let's see what the Google duck looks like damn okay so executive summary vehicle specification base cast breakdown extended range battery $1,000 terms I mean look it's an llm so llms are going to LM like not GNA fill in the blank like given like how few how little guidance have given it okay so then it got back to the time sensitive email Notifier um and it received the message back you see so it received the this message back it sent it in an email hi Florent I've prepared another proposal for the cber truck and and then it it kept me posted on slack so now oh yeah because I asked for several proposal like she she created several proposals so both of them ended up going through um and so now if I go back to my email yeah so because I asked her to create two proposals like she just received two proposals um it did take a good amount of time didn't it uh I sent this at 2m yeah it took like six minutes yeah not bad not bad and is it possible to have multiple Lindy running at the same time like what if I wanted to get 10 proposals out between two and 206 like oh yeah it's it's fully it's fully parallel okay it's I mean we we have we have customers who use us and who have like literally multiple thousands of tasks per day oh wow so it's just like their account is crazy and you can see like it's just like a ton of tasks a ton of Lind is active all the time um yeah yeah and again to me that's the beauty of it is like so we have an e-commerce customer he's using us as he's basically using Lind as his customer support agent and he sells like protein powder and like dietary supplements and stuff like that and um uh is it like um it's not sa Monday it's like Black Friday that for some reason is like a big day for him I don't know people buy supplements on Black Friday I guess um and uh the the you know like it used to be um for for for Black Friday he had to like stuff up his team or basically just accept that like operations would be absolute chaos for like and like he's he's um I forgot the name there like a kpi that people use for like the average ticket handling time or something like that like would go through the roof with Lindy it's just like hey if you receive an influx of 500 tickets in five minutes you're gonna have 500 Lind it's just like Cloud it's like a serverless cloud computing like boom boom boom you just see like a bunch of tasks that handled all at once and you pay like more credits in consequence and then if you receive no credits at night like you don't pay like you pay for humans to like two their THS just like you're paying nothing beautiful I mean dude this is I'm gonna I'm gonna have some fun tonight I'm just going to create a bunch of lindies and sort of I think for me like I was saying figuring out what the jobs to be done are repeatable tasks create you know step two is create those lindies uh step three is then okay Lindy to Lindy and and just see how I could start automating some stuff um this for me is really exciting because I don't want to create a company of thousands of employees um you know to me I I like small teams and any way I can automate some of the not so fun stuff i' I I I'd love to um and then I just think that there's probably an Arbitrage opportunity right now because not everyone is doing this um so you know thank you for sharing with us and um you know I guess I'll ask people to I hate I hate asking but like like comment subscribe that's what's going to get this video seen by millions of people um and Flo's been very generous with with his time so um Flo where could people you know start creating Lindy's and and get going yeah you just go to uh Lindy you can sign up uh there is so we do require payment information to sign up but like we don't take any money like a seven days free trial and you can cancel at any time um and yeah I mean you can reach out to me at any point like go to like email me at flow at ly. it may be a Lindy responding but yeah you you get to hear from everyone and then people sometimes ask me when I like show tools like this they're like oh Greg you're sponsored by uh Lindy it's like no like I literally just reached out to flow and was like hey come show my audience how to do this stuff um I just want I I think think that if you you know you get this information you're going to create really really interesting businesses um and uh I can't wait to see what you build so happy building everyone and uh blo I'll see you next time thank you so much Greg later [Music]

Title: How to steal funnels that crush
Published: 2024-10-30 19:15:03 UTC
Description:
I’m joined by Jordan Mix, Operating Partner at Late Checkout, to discuss how to build swipe files and how to remix successful strategies. Jordan breaks down why these marketing funnels work and the anatomy of a successful funnel. 

Episode Timestamps: 
00:00 Intro
01:14 Why build Swipe Files
03:47 Example 1: Tweets
08:27 Example 2: DTC Product 
11:57 Example 3: Thumbnails
14:35 Example 4: Landing Page
18:33 The Anatomy of a Funnel
22:10 Example 5: Email Followup 
26:01 Example 6: Digital Lead Magnet
28:45 Example 7: IRL Lead Magnet
30:13 Creating a Got Got Swipe File
31:02 Innovating on Pricing
31:21 Micro SaaS idea: AI Agent Funnel Scraper 

1) We see 4,000-10,000 ads daily. Turn that consumption into creation with a swipe file.
The best way to learn how to sell? Study how YOU got sold.
Create a "got got" file - save anything that makes you take action (click, share, buy).

2) Use My Mind to easily save & organize inspiration:
• Chrome extension for quick saves
• Tag system for easy retrieval
• Serendipity feature to surface random inspo
Beats bookmarking tweets you'll never see again!

3) Look for pattern interrupts & scroll-stoppers.
Example: Not Fried chicken ice cream 
Lessons:
• Combine unexpected elements
• Use high contrast visuals
• Mix hot & cold concepts
Apply this thinking to your digital products!

4) Anatomy of a killer funnel:
• Top: Free value (content, lead magnets)
• Middle: Nurture (email sequences, surveys)
• Bottom: Convert (calls, buy buttons)
Key: Top should be ALL about THEM. Only talk about yourself at the bottom.

5) IRL to URL: Don't forget offline lead gen!
Tiago Forte's "Building a Second Brain" book:
• Bonus chapter accessed via URL in book
• Segments readers for targeted offers
Think: How can you bridge physical & digital worlds?

6) Innovation isn't just about product. Consider:
• Marketing innovation
• Pricing model innovation
Example: Sublime app's "pay what you want" model
Could this work for your biz?

7) Micro SaaS idea: AI Agent Funnel Scraper 
Automatically collect & analyze:
• Email sequences
• Sales funnels
• Marketing tactics
Build a searchable database of winning strategies to remix!

8) Remember: Everyone's seeing "cool stuff" daily. You just need to train yourself to notice & capture it.

here's what the pros don't tell you Apple's best ads stolen from Nike Nike's best ads stolen from politics best political ads stolen from religion and this is what a swipe file really is it's your personal Vault of proven winners and today we're going to teach you how to build your very own swipe file uh where to find winning material the exact system you to organize it all and how to legally steal without copying um because in 25 30 minutes you're going to have a bigger Advantage than most 20year entrepreneur veterans uh I hope you enjoyed this episode uh see you in [Music] there all right today we got a special episode we've got Jordan he's an operating partner at lay checkout he works directly with me we are constantly sharing interesting things together on the internet within so that we could steal like an artist and if you're an entrepreneur stealing like an artist is going to get you ahead um so I brought Jordan on so he can teach you do a master class a tutorial on how um you could use the internet to to Spur your creativity how to save some of the things you see how to remix those things and why that's going to help you build a more profitable company um get you more customers validate your ideas um this is you know helps you take entrepreneurship from hard mode to less hard mode I'm not going to say it's easy right entrepreneurship is hard you know that building ideas is hard but I think that everyone needs a swipe and in this episode um we are going to talk about how we take inspiration how we turn it into swipe files and how that inspires us to build more profitable products without further Ado Jordan Take it Away share your screen live cook you know by the way people you got to stick through this whole episode to actually uh get the juice because I want you know if you stick through this whole episode you will leave with the ability to create your very own swipe file and the ability to sell which is the actual goal swi files are cool dollars are cooler so let's let's do it you know how many ads you see a day uh hundreds thousands I did some research it says four I don't know if this is like legit or not it's from goat goat fuel.com and they say 4,000 to 10,000 ads a day and you know the famous saying if it's free then you're the product you're the product people 10,000 ads a day you're being the product so creating a swipe file is good because you're turning that consumption into future creation and future Revenue potential because I think the best way to learn how to sell is studying how you got sold so let's cook a little bit I'm going to share my process you know to each their own but I recommend this one because it's the best I've seen to each their own but do do this yeah to each their own but Link in bio for my affiliate link cool all right so I'm surfing the web as we do and I see this tweet from Greg this is this is just on my feet because Greg just like lives on my feet I guess but oh my gosh by now pay later is not cool well I'm not going to price my my my tool like this because I want to be cool and I need to be uh pricing it in a way that's going to get people to buy now and pay later um or or not do that so how I use it this is I use this tool called my my mind and it's a really cool tool and it has a Chrome extension so if I'm sifting through this I'll click in see it maybe I like the design of this or or maybe I just like the the the saying of it you just have this Chrome tab up here and I like to tag this with got got because anytime I take action on something Click Share stop the scroll subscribe by any action is worth studying and I call that my gotg swipe file you can call it whatever you want but I got inspired by Marshon Lynch he he said a a hilarious funny um a thing he's like I'mma get got but I'mma get mine before I get got though and so that's the God got Swip file do you use my mind or anything like this I don't I'm actually one of those people that books marks things on X and then it just gets completely buried and I never go back to them so I know a lot of other people are like me because I was actually looking at my X analytics this morning and I noticed that in the last 28 days I've gotten 100,000 bookmarks on my content so that means that PE probably a lot of people listening bookmark my content um and they are probably like me they probably lose track of it it's very I mean yes there's fold on X um but it's it's not designed really to capture inspiration that's not why people uh it's not why the product managers product designers at X you know they want to create engagement and you know it's not about inspiration so um show me show me my mind yeah so that just went convinced me shh don't tell anyone but I've got 30 plus startup ideas that could make you millions and I'm giving them away for free these aren't just random guesses they're validated Concepts from entrepreneurs who built hundred million plus businesses I've compiled them into a one simple database compiled from hundreds of conversations I've had on my podcast but the main thing is most of these ideas don't need a single investor some cost nothing to start I'm pretty much handing you a cheat sheet the idea bank is your startup shortcut just click below to get access your next cash flowing business is waiting for you yeah for sure so that just went into just my mind which is everything that is a little scary showing everybody my my mind uh but um so that just went here and I got got the tag here so you can just tag and this basically creates a just a mood board of all of the things that you've gotten got with so like anytime I've signed up to a newsletter I usually am pretty religious on which one got me um and like I wanted this lead magnet for example it's like this guy killed it even though he did like Jack butcher style visuals uh he he got he got me so um I mean he got got from Jack Butcher and and then he created his own visual exactly the internet is a giant got got Circle uh people taking inspiration from people stealing like an artist I think like what's the saying like good artist copy great artist steal or good good artists create uh great artists steel I think great marketers great Builders remix what you could say is a steal but um I I like that better something that got me yesterday was this what am I looking at what are you looking at I mean it looks like it's an ice cream pint with fried chicken in it it's it's ice cream Fried Chicken literally this is ice cream no way with a chocolate bone right and like cornflake waffle cones on the outside that's insane and I just stopped the scroll immediately and I just wanted not Fried Chicken ice cream wasn't even in in in the the shoing for it but I was so is this a real product yeah this is a real product made in Charleston South Carolina I signed up for their like little like uh location um like tracker like when when it would when it find out when it's near you because like this like if this was just a normal waffle cone it could be the best ice cream in the world but no one would try it so I think this this is interesting in 2024 2025 and Beyond is you have to create scroll stopping unique things that are packaged in different ways to stand out so when you see something like this like we're not working on any ice cream products we don't really work in cpg that much so like what about this is relevant to creating you know SAS products or paid communities and stuff like that like why why is this relevant to you yeah so I look at like when I'm Windows when I'm on the internet I view it as like I'm Windows shopping yeah this isn't directly applicable to us I have no desire to make an ice cream but I think the principle is what stands out it's a scroll stopping pattern interrupt and so when we're designing like software products or landing pages or you know ads I go back to this and say like how could I be like not fried ice cream not Fried Chicken ice cream and tether it to the same principle that got me to stop the scroll and not just do what everyone's doing yeah I mean this could be applied to anything right like it's it's what is this if you break this down it's what are two things that don't normally go together uh like you don't think of like fried chicken and ice cream and then making it one Fried Chicken ice cream um using really nice contrast um the blue almost like a blue sky um with a cold kind of like concrete um you know you have the hot and the cold right the the hot chicken the cold ice cream so like when you when you truly break this down you could apply this to creating an ad for any sort of digital product or software company um and that's why to your point it is a remix it's not a steal it's like I'm inspired something about this got me therefore now I have a framework for how to actually come up with a a visual for whatever it is I'm doing okay I like this what else what else do you want to show I think this was incredible by Colin and Samir this uh thumbnail was so good and it I'm a subscriber to their Channel but I think I saw it on on X or something and it it it stopped me in my tracks did you see this I did see this I did see this I mean the difference between a good thumbnail and a actually I should say this let me let me back up the difference between an exceptional thumbnail and a great thumbnail is actually a big difference like Colin and Samir could have just put in a great thumbnail um their click the rate might have been like five six% um but having an exceptional uh unique uh thumbnail could be the difference of a you know 8 to 10% the rate now you might be like why does that matter that doesn't sound like that much but that difference of you know 20 to 40% lift and your first few thousand views tells the algorithm that this is a video that people need to watch and that could be the difference ultimately between a video that gets literally 10,000 views and 10 million views so this I saw this and I I was like wow like I haven't seen anything like this um and you just know that so many people like us SC got and this is now going to be like everyone's going to copy it and that's kind of like the curve of the of of of marketing right there's an Arbitrage opportunity that exists in the beginning um but over time it does get sort of played out yeah I think this is like the greatest thumbnail that I've ever seen like I'm I'm not joking because it goes so deep here like Colin is the one holding the the screen it says like hi Colin and the YouTube is about to change with the VR like it is so well done that they they clearly like this inspiration obviously AI is is cool but the level up from the inspo to the final and then seeing the results it just like really makes you think about what are the little nuances the four or five changes I can make to the things that I'm working on that will make take me out of my typical range and get me into an atypical outsized result I like it what else you got got this thing here uh a surge surge.com website audit you land on the page horrible name horrible name just tragic yeah tragic name using your framework for a tofu name this is be below tofu yeah this is not a good name and you hate to see it cuz on their website it says stop losing sales to website Ro roadblocks when it's like they should stop losing sales to not a great name they should but it goes to show you that you can get got with a bad name that's true but that's true wouldn't advise it for for Longevity if I hadn't saved it to the God got swipe file I would not be sharing it today so I just thought this was interesting their landing page immediately one call to action follows the Tweet size landing page framework that we're always that we're always talking about and it immediately got me um I didn't I didn't even have a Shopify store uh at the time and um so you enter this thing in they hit you with this you know where do you want to send your your free website audit and then this is a really cool thing an immediate upsell that they do so this audit is good they're they're about to send it to you via email but if you want to upgrade they give you this onetime offer here to upgrade to um one of their like paid audits so I think that funnel and that user Journey I'd be curious how how well it performs maybe not even on this splash screen but in the back end when they're sending the email because they they have these automated reports in the scraper that automatically judges your site and the output was pretty was pretty cool yeah this is exceptionally well done wow really well done so they hit me with this like immediately page load speed um you can like download this report give me a little like uh uh little status thing good stuff needs love like this is exceptional um and it's not beautiful really like this design is like fine but I still yeah I would tighten this up if I if I was them um like so it was actually like readable a little bit but um anyway I think this is like a really cool way to do free tools and get people in the funnel show don't tell without like hitting people over the head with like a long website yeah and obviously this is automated with AI and so there's so many ways that you can I'm sure people listening to this are like wow I can do this in Myspace or or you know there's just so many opportunities here they do it really really clean um yeah they they've got that tweet sized landing page which for for for people who don't know that's it's a it's a it's basically how we build Mo most of our websites or pretty much all of ours right Jordan it's like basically m max amount of uh 280 characters on your website like just keeping it very very tight um and it's a great place to start when you have an idea and you just want to put something clear um we'll actually include we can include in the um YouTube description uh three templates to the Tweet size landing page um I think it used to be 100 bucks for I think we're selling it for $29 now but we'll include that if people want to check it out um but yeah this is great this is this looks dope what what else you got oh here we go walk me through what I'm looking at right now yeah just the anatomy of a of a good funnel and it doesn't even need to be super tight but like what you just walked through is how you think how you need to think about the different stages uh when you're like going out and and window shopping the internet um so it's exactly what what you just said with like starts with media and content at the top it's free value create lead magnets that allow you to capture information and get them closer to you that's more more free value this could be like workshops free tools like surge free gifts um Shout Out J cream with the what was he saying like wag what was the word he was saying the book when he he gives away a free book free book but he kept saying this one word in the in the episode the it was like Waggles or something it was like some acronym about giving free gifts away and he was like like it was like common knowledge anyway free gifts work um and then and then sending email um sending email with welcome sequences newsletters surveys repurposing your your media and content via email I think is a a place that people really don't squeeze the juice like they have all of this content it could be repackaged especially in a world of AI where hey break down the top three points of an hourlong YouTube video and then link the YouTube video you already have that content so like squeeze the juice in in the middle of the funnel and then nurture and convert nurture email educational email courses newsletters surveys another repurposing content via email and then convert is like book calls and put buy buttons on the internet yeah so I mean this is like a got got like I I just got got by this image that you just posted I know it's yours but um let's let's go through more of uh more things I got got you cool yeah one thing I want to say real quick about this is the top of the funnel and top of your like got got funnel needs to be about them like cons like it should be all about them in the nurture you can do about them and start to add you into their lives and then the conversion is all about how you're going to help how you're going to help them and and that's where you have the Liberty to talk about yourself I think a lot of people get this get this wrong where they they start putting themsel in this in this top category to too quickly um quick ad break let me tell you about a business I invested in it's called boring marketing.com so a few years ago I met this group of people that were some of the best SEO experts in the world they were behind getting some of the biggest companies found on Google and the secret sauce is they've got a set of technology and AI that could help you outrank your competition so for my own businesses I wanted that I didn't want to have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I didn't want to depend on ads to drive customers to my businesses I wanted to rank high in Google that's why I like SEO and that's why I use boring marketing.com and that's why I invested in it they're so confident in their approach that they offer a 30-day Sprint with 100% money back guarantee who does that nowadays so check it out highly recommend boring marketing.com I thought this was really well done so oh yeah when you're creating um the media you get a newsletter subscriber cool you got them they open the first one but they didn't take action on submitting a survey Tyler the uh CEO of beehive uh is doing a really well really good job with this and um I saved it so you forgot something we didn't fill didn't fill out the the Subscribe survey it's a nudge to get that subscriber data it's valuable to know who you're sending to and this is the like the very simple form um so don't be afraid to re-engage the people who have already opted into your stuff yeah that's the lesson learned and I I mean again it's like you got got you saw that and then you had the realization you know the Insight of that right so I think that the mistake a lot of people are going to make is they're going to download my mind they're going to start throwing things in there um but they're going to forget the insights so I almost think it's worth creating like a separate dock or just like maybe you can do this within my mind could you put notes within my mind yeah you can have notes in in my mind so like if I wanted to add the chicken like it's like pattern interrupting nice contrast frame breaker you know whatever I wanted to put in there so that's what I think people need to do cuz and especially as you write it down it will solidify it in your brain around like oh okay then the next time uh you create an ad it just you might you you know you might just think oh yeah Fried Chicken ice cream pattern recogition you know frame breaker it's just going to hit so you you you're just going to refer less back to these things and it's just going to be you're going to be a stronger entrepreneur from it you're gonna be a stronger maker and your stuff's going to hit so um I think that the notes feature really really important here totally and you can add other tags too like if I wanted to say like add ads to this like you can add multiple tags too um yeah I think doing this over six months a year like really being religious as you Window Shop the internet turning your consumption into like curation and then ultimately creation you develop this taste and like subconscious skill that you didn't even know you would have and you start to see things differently and see how behaviors work and if you're building a product that you would use or be the user of which is probably a large majority of people that are building businesses like they have the problem themselves it makes you so it makes if you study how you got sold and you're the potential user of your product you're selling yourself basically so it's easier to sell other customers there's also going to be people listening to this that are going to be like okay good you know well good for you you've got all these amazing sources of you're seeing all this really cool stuff I don't see cool stuff and the reality is everyone who's listening to this is seeing cool stuff like you're seeing cool stuff you might not be seeing cool stuff meaning it might not be like it might be subconscious basically but you are seeing cool stuff everyone is uh it's just about mapping it because you are getting sold we are all getting sold one you know many many many many many dozens hundreds thousands of times per day yeah what else uh what else you got that you want to show this this one I'm going to talk about we've been talking about digital a little bit and I think this IRL to URL lead magnet is so good and this got me probably in 2020 and it's it's still living rentree in the brain so this is forte Labs building a second brand there's a bonus chapter at the end on how to build a second brain creating a tagging system he gives you the URL in the book so I if I bought this in the airport he's going to end up with my email even though that he didn't sell it sell it to me so I get get the chapter and then this is another thing that that I think a lot of entrepreneurs and Builders need to be thinking about is segmenting Their audience so they can give them offers that people want instead of sending an email to 10,000 people you can send five emails to 2,000 each exactly what they want and so Thiago friend of the Pod is using this thing called write message you can see it's a segmenting tool but he basically breaks breaks people out into like hey cool got the bonus chapter now you see him looking to sell you on note taking you know services or products so it's like yes I take notes on paper or no I'm digital if he has 800 8,000 people do paper maybe he builds a paper product if he has Mo mostly on digital maybe he builds a digital um so I think this is a really well done capture pulling people out of your your your uh normal like media Cadence and people who buy your book and and get the bonus chapter so what do what do you think about this I mean I I love it I think it's smart uh it's basically like adding lead magnets in a book so lead magnets we think of as digital because they are digital but just because they're digital doesn't mean that the way you find them need to be uh digitally so I think the Insight like the note that I would write in my my mind would be like where else in the world uh you know is is there an opportunity to get to get someone from IRL to URL based on what I'm building um so I like this I think it's big um and it gets your creative juices flowing so you know it's it's awesome one more IRL for us one one more IRL and then what and then what else do you want to cover yeah just like I've got a little micros sass idea um that could help people build um their their swipe files quicker so you don't have to screen grab and do all this stuff um so this was Pop-Tarts they they uh they sponsored one of the bowl games and they made a giant poptart and it went viral obviously became a meme and I was just captivated by this because usually these big sponsorships are a waste of a waste of money um I would say or like it's hard to track the attribution like a Super Bowl ad Etc but look at the results of this they sold 22 million more Pop-Tarts the next week after after they did this bow game and I bought [Laughter] Pop-Tarts that's funny crazy yeah there you go thinking outside the box and like you can apply this to however you want like maybe there thinking outside the Pop-Tart box thinking outside the Pop-Tart box I like it that's the Insight sure all right so now tell us how we could build our own swipe file in the most efficient efficient way yeah Spill the Beans spill the beans I would download my mind and I would start saving things start tagging notes and really just like follow your curiosity and just start start saving stuff um is what I would say there's other there's other tools that you can use too um this one's pretty cool uh the sublime app that I've been tempted by um it's basically like uh my mind meets Pinterest so you can have like uh um Public public things um but this stood out to me because of their their pricing section which is just really beautifully done I sent you this as a got got you did I was like this is this is dope yeah uh any you know I think a lot about well how do I say this people think a lot about Innovation on product like how do I innovate the product and I think now now we're getting to the point where people are saying okay products are basically commoditized now people are thinking how do I innovate on marketing great but there's also the the ability to to innovate on pricing model and I think that's going to be a more more interesting thing you're starting to see that already with you know this movement from uh subscriptions to payer task um a lot of AI companies are charging payer task or credit system what Sublime is doing there like pay what you want um so that Insight is huge I sent that to you because I was like pay what you want I've tweeted about it I think that's a really interesting model and um and yeah I like it cool anything anything else you wanna you want to say this is what I mean just studying how you got sold is incredible like use use the tools that we talk aled about but I I wish there was a tool that existed and may maybe we'll build it um like an AI agent that could go and basically scrape these funnels instead of me stumbling upon it clicking in subscribing screen grabbing emails putting it in figma like you can save you know all the stuff in the world but if you don't have the like digital footprint or the digital road map it's really hard to reverse engineer so I would love a AI agent funnel scraper that you could basically send agents out into the world then study email sequences bring them all back into a database that was even searchable and see how people are sequencing things selling things doing direct response marketing and just like tapping into a database of history that you can remix for yourself without having to put a bunch of the leg work in and the research time and and really just like focus on building building the work so that's why I'm pumped about AI agents is just like that capability like more people can put more stuff out into the world if they had like a b catalog of this of the stuff great yeah I think that's a it's a great free startup idea and if I know this audience they don't they take these ideas and go run with it so wouldn't be surprised if someone built it um this got me thinking a lot about I've been doing what a form of what you're doing but just like I said on Twitter X bookmarks and I haven't I haven't invested so to speak in my swipe bile because I'm always you know it's always like I'll do it later I'll do it later but now I'm kind of like this is really important to do um I think this is really important to do do um so you inspir me to do it so thank you um and uh I'll see you next time on the show Jordan where could people follow you on the internet you can find me on X jrdn mix MX cool we'll include that in the YouTube bio and uh folks I hope uh I hope you enjoy this as much as I did and um like comment subscribe do it you know that's my that's you getting you know got got right if this provided a sense of value to you uh the way to get this to spread on the Internet is to like and comment it also just makes us feel good honestly that we should continue doing these videos and that it's valuable to you so please let us know and um all right I'm gonna go and uh get got I'll see you later get it all right peace peace baby [Music]

Facebook/YouTube ads → Landing page → Free valuable content → Call booking
This simple funnel structure has generated MILLIONS for AJ&Smart

Jonathan's "ugliest" funnel:
• 4 years old
• Looks terrible
• Generated $20M+ revenue
Lesson: Done is better than perfect. Launch fast, iterate later.

4) The power of long-form content:
1-hour training video → Deeper engagement → More qualified leads
People who invest time watching = more likely to buy

5) Pixeling + retargeting = marketing gold
Track visitors, show them targeted ads across platforms.
Build an inescapable marketing web!

6) Email marketing isn't dead, it's EVOLVING
Capture emails → Drip feed value → Segment based on behavior → Targeted offers
Smart email funnels = predictable revenue

7) Physical products STILL WORK in digital age
Free book funnel = game changer
People love holding something tangible. Use it to your advantage!

8) The MIFGY secret (Most Incredible Free Gift Yet)
Stack one-time bonuses on your offer. Create FOMO.
Even high-end brands use this. It just WORKS.

9) Key takeaway: Funnels aren't sleazy, they're ESSENTIAL
Top brands like Eight Sleep, AG1, and Whoop all use these tactics.
It's not about tricking people. It's about guiding them to solutions they need.

could this be the most impactful startup ideas podcast episode Jonathan Courtney walked through his $20 million funnel and exactly how you could do the same I know that sounds kind of cheesy and tacky but we talked about ways to 10x your conversion rate and he just tells the secrets this is incredible one of my favorite episodes uh you're going to love it and uh it was a lot of fun [Music] you see this chalk okay I don't want to look at your rock climbing sweat for some reason this might be the most requested podcast oh no on the startup ideas podcast people want to know and understand funnels and how to build funnels we've got Jonathan Courtney uh we've got Jay to the ice cream we've got Jay ice cream jce cream whatever you want to call him the prince of Ireland the king of Berlin the prince of Ireland yeah like the legend of berim he's here he's gonna talk about funnels we're back baby ah hello hey man hey man hey audience um I'm very well prepared for this uh funnel chat as you you can see here I've got my slides um and my thing to create the slides so it's going to be fun um you're so I did say on the last episode that I was on that I would talk about how to how like basically kind of do a funnels 101 sort of session um so yeah I mean just maybe good to know upfront I don't I'm not like a funnel marketing teacher or something um so if anyone's like oh he doesn't teach it good that's not actually my job my job I make funnels to make money um for my own business and occasionally for other people's businesses but I'm not a teacher of this topic I just do it so if there's maybe occasionally you'll have to just you know jump in with questions or thing or you also know about funnels but like maybe you can imagine yourself as the audience if you have things where you're like that maybe wouldn't make sense to people um yeah I think that context is important I'm not a I don't have a funnel marketing course that you can buy from me perfect I love it I know you're not a funnel teacher you're wearing a hat backwards if you were a teacher it would be forwards yeah it would be like now I'll sell it to you exactly okay let's dive in okay so I think a lot of people don't really understand what funnels are and I think also a lot of people um shy away from the concept of funnels because they are not often used in well I think people mix up like websites and funnels that's the first thing so what is a funnel first of all well a funnel is really just a stepbystep process from turning someone from being a complete stranger or non-customer so it could be someone on your list so a complete stranger or a non-customer into a paying customer customer so that's what a funnel does different to a website a website is more like your brochure a website is more like here's all of the stuff that's going on okay so just to give you an example this is the our website so just a website is a place where there's just all of the stuff that you do it's just loads of you know it's a it's almost like walking into a grocery store you don't exactly know exactly what to do but it's a place for browsing it's a it's a place for just kind of getting a feel for a company um but it's not really a focused thing which is telling you do this then do this then do this it's not going to necessarily take you from being a stranger to a customer it's really a brochure of stuff so that's what a website is so this is our website I'm going to use this as a comparison to what one of our funnels look like websites are what we call or what people in the kind of funnel World call call Shadow funnels so website is a shadow funnel it's almost just there to prove that you're actually a real company and sometimes it's almost just there so you yourself can figure out what you do and just have like a home for your stuff but you actually can't reach the funnels from the website and you can't reach the website from the funnels they're completely separate project they're completely separate URLs and they're actually living in their own separate worlds and like project teams Concepts all of that kind of stuff so you can see here on the website it looks you know nice it's a nice looking website it's professionally done but soon you're going to get a very shocking comparison to how much we don't care about that kind of stuff when we're making a funnel because funnels are really about making money um generating leads uh generating call bookings and those things need to be changed and and messed around with a lot so this is a website but Jonathan I spend so much time building my website in order to do those things what do you mean that you know my website shouldn't be my website is you know isn't designed to drive leads and create customers yeah well first of all I think unless you're running you know unless you have unbelievably good SEO and you're spending you know good money and have good talent to get the Google ads to go towards your website unless you have a lot of brand recognition your website is not going to sell things for you necessarily your website is still the place where people are going you're people are not necessarily going to your website as a first thing that the first time they find out about you they're going there later to see wait let's just make sure this is a real thing so like for example if you get a recommendation for a great Spa in the city or something or a great Barber maybe after you get the recommendation from someone then you'll check the website just to make sure but it's not often especially with high ticket things you know things that cost a lot of money the website is more there just to make sure okay these guys are real they work with people but we're not making any money not a lot of money is being generated from the website itself um so yeah and and by the way we haven't had enough nice we didn't have a nice website for like the first 12 years of the company this website only or 14 years of the company this website only launched last week and we only did it as a branding exercise so yeah websites are not like necessarily how you make money or how anyone makes money and that can be pretty confusing because shh don't tell anyone but I've got 30 plus startup ideas that could make you millions and I'm giving them away for free these aren't just random guesses they're validated Concepts from entrepreneurs who built hundred million plus businesses I've compiled them into one simple database compiled from hundreds of conversations I've had on my podcast but the main thing is most of these ideas don't need a single investor some cost nothing to start I'm pretty much handing you a cheat sheet the idea bank is your startup shortcut just click below to get access your next cash flowing business is waiting for you people will tell you to spend a lot of money on your websites and they'll tell you that you should like have the perfect brand and all of this kind of stuff um that's not the way and that could make sense if you're a Lifestyle brand and the goal is to like build up this Mystique around the brand and all this kind of stuff maybe you're a Michelin star restaurant um there's a lot of places where maybe funnels don't make sense but if you're selling what what we sell is we sell training to corporates which is which can be pretty high ticket uh we also sell training to individuals which up to you know $14,000 per per participant joining one of our trainings we also of course sell then digital hybrid coaching versions of that so from about 5,000 or $5,000 to open-ended that's our range of things we're selling but we're not trying to be like you know we're not like a Michelin star restaurant that has to have The Branding perfect everywhere um so yeah funnels are where we then fun most people find out about us through a funnel and how our funnels work again completely separate to the website in fact unrelated and you're you're not even going to see the same branding on them our funnels which I'll show you one in a minute they basically could start as a Facebook ad or a YouTube video that leads you into a super focused page which tells you one thing and has one call to action and the whole goal of that funnel is to do one thing and that one thing could be book a call with us or buy something so it's usually one of two things um and we always have a couple of run funnels running at the same time but just a first conceptual thing is that funnels and websites are not the same thing and actually what's really complicated in this world is that people who make really nice websites are generally not good at making funnels at all because funnels require really good copywriting and and and mostly it's about conversion optimization for that specific flow so for us it's call booking Generation Um whereas someone who's really good at making a website is maybe very good at visual design ux design um but they can't tell you how to make money and how to sell stuff um and yeah a funnel is just a completely totally different separate thing to a website does that kind of First Step makes sense the first step makes sense I just want to add one I want to add my point of view and how I see funnels and websites differently a website will on average convert you know one to 3% of people um to to to buy something or book a call or something like that that means that roughly 98% of people who come to your website don't do the thing that you want them to do which like no one talks about it's crazy right you it's the most most leaky uh ship on the planet a website now a funnel it isn't crazy for a funnel to convert at 10 15 20 25% and I want to see what your your funnels uh look like but that's like uh the one of the reasons why funnels are so important because if you could if you know if I can tell you you can 10x your conversion rate what is the impact of that on any anyone who's listening to this any idea that they have any product that they have any business that they have 10x in your conversion rate is quite literally probably one of the biggest things you can do to actually grow your company yes and I don't I don't even know how people set like when I meet somebody let's say somebody who selling um an in-person training uh when I'm talk to them and they're like how the hell are you selling out these $14,000 training sessions like cuz what they do actually this is a great example a really great example of how someone else does something versus how we would do it and I'll just give you the exact example of this right now like visually um I think it's important to see this stuff first before going into like the nitty-gritty details so if you would if you were an outsider and you were guessing how we make money with let's say let's just choose our online training right so our online training is called Workshop or Master it's like a mixture of online and uh coaching that's me like thousand years ago so if you were from the outside and you were like wanting to compete with AJ and smart right you were like I'm going to figure out how to make money the same way AJ and smart makes money so you go to our website facilitator decom you go to the page for the product you want to copy and you're like okay so they basically have this landing page and through this landing page people Book application calls and then that's how they make money right that that's how it works that's how AJ and smart works and if you would make that mistake you you would essentially you know [ __ ] yourself up because that's not even slightly how we do it and that's often not how companies do this at all like they have their like facade but that's not how this company makes money but often people will copy the facade and not know why it's not working for them another quick example of that could be this uh if you look here if you look here at our in uh inperson training I was having a chat with a guy yesterday who I'm helping sell an in-person event and he was like how the hell like he said that he put a an event online in January last year or January this year um and it's like $4,000 to come to it he only needs to fill 50 seats and he still hasn't filled it and it's it's like happening in November and it's one month from now and he's only sold like 20 tickets or something and he said it's been a super manual process so I asked him okay so like what was the process of selling it what campaign did you do what funnel did you run and he said well we just put it on the website and no one's buying buying it and it's just crazy to me that anyone actually does this it's it's totally shocking to me that this even happens um like it's if we put if that was how we sold if that's how we expected to sell out three events per year at $144,000 uh this my business would would not exist because no one would ever buy it because it's too high ticket and also like why why would you buy it it's just on the website you can decide whenever you want so we don't do that um we build funnels right we build uh single purpose funnels to solve these problems and these funnels are very ugly um no attention is paid to the design and the copy in the end is not even aligned with our brand because the copy is very much whatever marketing style copy is working for this particular funnel um and it's it's not like totally insanely misaligned like [ __ ] you [ __ ] it's just that the style of copy is not the style of copy we would ever put on our own website because it's not representative of what our brand is uh but it works really well for the funnel so our funnel yeah so maybe and maybe this is where you're going but it sounds like you're saying I have a secret but I can't tell you will you be showing us some of your secret funnels yes I'm gonna show I'll show you everything well I don't want I don't want everything because I know you I know you Jonathan if you show everything you know this won't get approved on YouTube so let's let's true that's true so I'll show you I'll show you uh kind of one or two funnels that are running today um and that people can actually look at live um that's the beauty like the cool thing about me actually not really being a marketing teacher is that I am just running these things for my own business right now uh so I can just show you the the live things that you can see today yes um and I'd love to be able to also show you so we're we're also doing this for one or two other companies but I'm not allowed to this is a kind of thing where we do that secretly behind the scenes and I I I don't want to talk about them publicly but the all the same principles apply okay um okay let's open up a funnel or let's have a look at how this work how we do this in funnel Style versus website uh versus website so step one is always or the the first part of the funnel for us is always either Facebook ads met meta ads or YouTube ads if you're wondering why we don't run LinkedIn ads it's just because they don't tend to work as well for us that's the answer to the question we're just choosing the ads that give us the best Roi so these are the current or like a selection Facebook is a bit weird it's like doesn't actually always show all of them could you zoom in a little yeah everyone has not everyone has as good as eyes as you do okay um let's see a nice one to go through okay I'm just trying to think of a good my team does look at this look at this um we make some silly fun ads um I'm just thinking of which funnel to go into you guys can go into all of these funnels I think these are just the ones that are working the best right now okay whatever let's just choose this one so this is an ad want to boost your facilitation career this ad is just being targeted at people who are reading a certain type of book that we we think could be in our industry so for example we'll type into Facebook ads hey anybody who's reading gamestorming who's read any of ID's books who's read The Lean Startup whatever uh show people these ads so there's a lot more that goes into it but you can actually look at that if you go yourself to Facebook ads library and and figure it out so this this is an ad that leans leads to a super focused landing page which is full to the absolute brim I'm just making this a little bit smaller so I can zoom in a bit more it's full to the absolute brim with copy like it's insane and this you click here you end up here become a high paid facilitator in 90 days or less very like QV QVC style I see I just see the ad oh here we go boom okay you get brought to this page this page most people open it up and mobile I actually haven't seen it on desktop in a long time and it's bringing you to one thing and that's a free training this free training is actually a onh hour long training that gives you a sense of what it actually would be like to get trained by us so it's a 1hour training using a format which I learned from going to lots of marketing conferences and just watching other people um and this format a lot of it I stole from this book called expert Secrets which I showed on the last episode but there's this section of that book called epiphan by the way this funnel has been running since 2020 and it hasn't changed quick ad break let me tell you about a business I invested in it's called boring marketing.com so a few years ago I met this group of people that were some of the best SEO experts in the world they were behind getting some of the biggest companies found on Google and the secret sauce is they've got a set of technology and AI that could help you outrank your competition so for my own businesses I wanted that I didn't want to have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I didn't want to depend on ads to drive customers to my businesses I wanted to rank high in Google that's why I like SEO and that's why I use boring marketing.com and that's why I invested in it they're so confident in their approach that they offer a 30-day Sprint with 100% money back guarantee who does that nowadays so check it out highly recommend boring marketing.com and this is 1 hour and 10 minute uh long session with me uh teaching you basically the basics you need to become a facilitator and also all the things you need to do to actually build a career as a facilitator this is a a new intro we added this year just so people wouldn't be confused why I look like this in the whole training uh and then I look like this in the ads so it's actually the only update we did in four years so people watch the training after a while this button appears after uh people have watched it I think we have it like if they skip forward they can kind of hack it but they have to watch it for like 15 minutes or something before it appears and at the end of this video or multiple times through this video I mention that if you want to know more you can talk to my team I keep mentioning this over and over again and I'm showing I'm I'm basically giving away a lot of information here like a lot of information I'm teaching a lot of stuff that you could go away with but there's going to be certain people who are watching this who are like I actually love this and I'm not the type of person who wants to read you know 30 books and take two years to do this I want to speak with the AJ and smart team and see what type of training I might be able to get or I might be able to get from my team uh to make this happen so then so this wait wait I need to interrupt you for a second so what you're saying without saying it is you make an obnoxiously long video yes basically like doesn't have to be obnoxiously long this funnel has an obnoxiously long video I know but having an obnoxiously long video and an obnoxiously long German as well different hairstyles I'm kidding there um is really impactful cuz when you there's a lot of people who don't have time to actually go and and listen to this and then that's when you get them deeper deeper in your funnel so that's one Insight that I'm learning from from this that's one thing they would never have watch this 1 hour long video if they hadn't had to unlock it and if it was e easier to find you know basically they're finding this because they came through a Facebook ad they have no like the the URL is insane they have and this is not on purpose it's just the nature of a funnel not having a place that it lives on your website so actually if they do just close this uh and they don't enter their email address they won't ever find it again but because they entered their email address we can now kind of first of all people can watch the video and if they enter their email address we essentially play out the video over email if we see that they didn't watch the video and we play it out to them over multiple days and still end with this call to action to book a call but yes having them focused and watching this video in a funnel is a lot more effective than having that just on the website okay second thing because I don't want to lose people here who are watching this and listening to this and are like cool this might work for a workshop company but I run a uh software business I run a uh e-commerce business I run a you know agency does this work for other verticals what are your thoughts yeah it definitely works for other ver um the company that I learned it from is a software company that uses a for themselves um and that's that's clickfunnels they basically sell software using this process using funnels and they also sell lots of other different types of software and there's also lots of other software companies doing it however okay I think there are some people there are some situations where so it makes sense it makes absolute sense for any situation where you'll want to turn a stranger into a customer that's basically the the system for it right turning strangers into customers but it doesn't have to be a 1-hour long video that might not work for a software company for a software company we might might want to do something a little bit more simple um there's millions of different types of funnels and campaigns that you can run um I'm just trying to think is there a company where it wouldn't work yeah anything where extreme Prestige is important like a Michelin star restaurant um although I have seen High Prestige things like doctors that are like you know they'll charge you 250k per year to take care of your blood work and all of this I've seen things like this using funnels um I don't know it works for basically every yeah it's not going to work for a like a large corporate is not going to do this um open AI is not going to do this today like this is I think it's best for bootstrapped business um because you're getting the direct Roi from the ads whereas if you have loads of uh funding already then maybe you can just brute force it with branding and different types of deals and having a huge sales team so I think it works really well for bootstrapped businesses it my speciality is selling uh training either in person or online either to large corporates or to individual ual and training can be literally um you know teaching people design teaching people facilitation um teaching people public speaking is a big one at the moment um any I can teach I can build funnels for those types of things I can also build funnels for agencies looking to get high ticket projects like designing websites doing marketing for people that kind of [ __ ] but I personally have haven't done it for a software company but I've just seen it that's I don't know if that answers your question co it basically it works for most types of verticals where you just what you just walked off screen it's like that open the window oh it was getting notd in here goodbye yeah okay cool I haven't seen I haven't seen too many but there are verticals so um I shouldn't say yeah okay well I I'll tell them before this episode comes out um um so we have this separate company to AJ and smart called Partners where we partner up with companies to do this we don't do it as an agency we basically advise them on building funnels but they have to be able to execute everything themselves the things that I'm not comfortable selling or where I'm not where I don't where I think it's way harder number one if you don't want to run ads it's very difficult number two if you have no list at all and you have no experience doing any type of marketing it is a bit of a it's it's not super easy to go from zero to 100 then I even recommend I'm like like this person who wanted to do the partners thing with us I was like I think you need to hire someone in house who can do it because I can't really advise you I can't help you do this if no one can execute the work so if you're like totally um unaware of how to build landing pages how to do copy that kind of stuff it might be more difficult as well and if you're not if you don't want to hire anybody to do it cool but then then again a website doesn't do anything so you need to do something you got do marketing yeah totally okay so I'll just continue this funnel for a second to show you where it goes also people will say um yeah like one one big worry people have is like well that funnel like the funnel I'm showing you now which is 4 years old old they're going to be like that looks shitty like that doesn't really represent the brand and what I would say to that is the you know the general Vibe and feeling of that funnel I was able to pull that together in a couple of hours in in this clickfunnels program there's so many different other ones as well uh mostly by myself uh without having to think too much about it and initially it was just to test one product right I was just trying to see can we sell this one product using this type a funnel my goal later was to turn it into something much nicer but what actually happens is it does really well and every time we try to make it look nicer it does worse so the like shittiest looking funnels we have tend to be the seven figure funnels and the nicest looking stuff we have tend to not make any money at all which is very annoying because we're like also a design agency so and why do you think that's the case I think lots and lots of copy tends to work well like really good convincing copyrighting um and a kind of Scrappy look to it I don't know I it's just seems to work I don't know why well I think the simple answer to it is when we try to make something look nice it has way less text like look at the the the comparison between this and and we're less willing to fill it up with text as well because we don't want it to look ugly so like there's this which is our kind of I keep changing the size because I'm on a massive monitor here and it's just easier for me to see so this is like our you know nice looking thing you know it's it's kind of there's not so much text right up top then you have and and I know you can see this right now for a second then you have this which I think looks absolutely Dreadful and actually I see that this line this has actually also broken itself here but whatever who cares um this looks horrible I hate it actually I just realized like look at the difference between the size of this button and this button I'm actually disgusted but it's just packed full of information that somehow seems to work well and people seem to need and we AB test the crap out of this kind of thing so I don't know this is just this funnel is annoyingly popular like as in this one has generated this year so this launched in 2020 this one funnel which I can barely look at will has already passed 20 million Revenue in it but in its lifetime just to be super clear um so in the last four years actually it started officially in May so in the last three and a half years this one funnel has generated 20 million revenue and it looks like [ __ ] and I don't even like the video anymore I'm like I I've made so many better things than this since then and I'm embarrassed that people see it but actually when people see it for the first time they really like it so I just have to get it out of my head that new stuff has to be made all the time here's the in here's the Insight if you aren't disgusted with your funnel you've launched too late actually yes yeah I mean most dude most people who are not like I feel like a lot of entrepreneurs have a severe lack of urgency and a lack of willingness to just see what happens if I get something out there I you know I talk to a lot of a lot of friends who run companies ask me about funnels because they're like okay I believe you now I want to do funnels I've seen the numbers and I'm like cool so like here's what you have to do and then they're like oh yeah yeah yeah maybe I'll get around to that next year and I'm ah you know I just like well whatever see you um so I'll just show will I show you the rest of this funnel yeah let's do it cool all right let's see um by the way audience I know maybe you're expecting that I would show like a slides or something but again I don't I don't um I'm not a teacher of this I just want to show you the stuff that's live okay so now you can see that I'm showing a type form now is that what's on screen for you yep okay so we've added we add this type form when our lead flow is low uh too high so when we have a lot of lead flow as in where our Facebook ads are working really well and loads of people are booking calls we add in this survey but when the lead flow is low when ads are expensive when not so many people are coming in we turn it off so it's just a way to add friction so this is a friction increasing survey that we'll add in before you have the ability to book a call with us just to avoid our team getting put on to like calls that kind of suck I haven't seen this in a long time because the team messes with it every day um I even spell my name wrong let's see what do you currently do for work I don't know uh okay I'm just GNA BL what would you like our help with the most okay um and this is also a great question how committed are you to achieving your goals and overcoming your challenges like especially if I'm going to sell someone an in-person training I don't want someone who's like ah we'll see you know what I mean it's going to be way harder for me to teach them then why are you interested in the program do know this is Jonathan testing I actually need to say that to my team because they're going to read this um if it proves to be your best next step how much uh how much can you invest in yourself right now this is this is really an interesting way to just split people up because if they say less than a th Juro then we just recommend that they use our free stuff which is way easier for everyone okay this is an important one if you're accepted into this particular program in this particular funnel how soon do you want to get started immediately um what's your best email address Greg gus.com where are you based Greg and let's see if I get accepted to do a call yes okay schedule your call so now I'm going to book I'm actually going to not do this so we only allow people to book calls three days ahead of time um that's because if you allow someone to book a call next week or 4 days or like this is basically what happens is you can guess they'll be like ah forget it and they'll just won't turn up to the call you need to have people join calls within very close to the time when they've actually watched the video and when they're actually interested in doing the thing um so after the call booking it's just in their calendar it's through calendly that's called a vsl funnel it's called a video sales letter funnel the structure is always the same your from your YouTube channel or your Facebook ads I'll show you how we send send people from YouTube if you're curious so YouTube channel or Facebook or your list you're sending people into a free training you H you do have to come up with a training that free training then essentially shows people how knowledgeable you are and how much you understand the problem and how much you also for sure have the solution and then you're saying you can either do two things one is you can learn all the things I did take get all the experience I have that will take this long or you can take the headache that's the free version and then the headache free version is jump on a call with us we can tell you um if working with us will help you or whatever and we have funnels like that for kind of all the different parts of our business uh but what's interesting is so we've spent ludicrous amounts of time on money and money buil last year my one of my teams spent a ludicrous amount of time building a beautiful high-end stunning looking funnel for corporate it's only only for corporate training and this funnel the one you just saw which is clearly not targeted at corporates this generates us the most amount of corporate training leads and the most amount of corporate um like agency leads even though we're not actually trying to sell that using this funnel they just learn about us they see our teaching style and then they want to they want to jump on a call with us so one person who came through this funnel in September to who was interested in coming to one of our trainings recently booked us for 300K internal large training session at their company so that's that's funnels work funnels don't just work to sell individual low ticket things or individual courses or things like that they're also conversation starters which I think is really important and no one ever books a conversation through our website pretty much ever um yeah that's a vssl funnel a lot of other funnels are the same are a similar structure I can show you another one if you're curious yeah let's show show us another one and then I want to see probably want to end up on on YouTube and how you actually how you actually do that I can just show you on YouTube first because it will relate to this funnel it will be easier for me to find something specifically for this funnel um let's just search it's was tricky showing I'm going to can I go into like a private mode for I don't want anyone to see my what [ __ ] I'm looking at on YouTube I I definitely don't want to see that you know all right let's see um if I search so with YouTube it's pretty this is actually a great example of how people also don't manage to really monetize their YouTube channels uh because they don't really understand how to do I know you can't see anything right now I'll show you I'll show you a few ways that we funnel people using YouTube how to design a workshop let's choose this one all right okay here we go so share okay here is a uh 36 minute video of me going through teaching people how to run workshops in Fairly good detail and what I'm constantly saying during this video is if you want to have a deeper dive into this go to the comments and click on this link and this link actually in this case brings you straight to the exact funnel that we saw so we're trying to capture their email addresses we're trying to give them another more focused pitch on what we do um but we're using this education element up front to warm them up for even going into the funnel so this is an example of where if I click here I know it's not going to open straight away but it brings you straight to here right where we've been already so also what's really great is if your team if you're running a team like uh let me just actually this is a really important point if you're running a team and they're making like you're running a company you're making content and you're the CEO of the company you're like I don't know if any of this content is doing anything uh that's often what happens when I'm talking to someone and and they're trying to figure out like like YouTube and podcast and all of this they're like I don't know if this content is actually doing anything the first thing the first thing I ask them is okay and and they're like oh my team members are making all this content that doesn't really make sense I don't really know like if they're doing a good job maybe I should hire someone else and then my first question is where where are you sending people from your content and they're like oh we have loads of places like depends on the content sometimes it's this sometimes it's that my first step for them is your content teams only goal from today on is to send people to this one funnel that we're going to create together there's no other place where you send people and all of your content always the CTA is sending them to this one place and then your uh other team your sales team and your your like actual internal marketing team who's building the funnels and and trying to make money they have one goal their only goal is to get more call bookings so at u i one day I want to like bring some of the people we we work with together uh in a in a call like this as well just so we can talk about the different funnels but we worked with a public speaking guy and we sat with this te we flew over we sat with this team and after listening you know three or four hours to all the different problems I realized the number one problem they had is you guys don't have one metric that everyone is following and that metric from today on is fill up and we use like the there was a sales guy working there so it was fill up this guy's calendar so every day when you start the day your goal is to fill up this guy's calendar when you're making when you're making new content your only goal is to fill up his calendar and within like a month it was just full all the time because they had that one goal and because now they had one funnel which had one goal of filling up the filling up that funnel so our YouTube channel for almost all of 2021 2022 and 2023 it only links to one funnel and that's it just the same one you saw over and over again um it also links to some other places so I want to show you just a quick example of another slightly different type of funnel which is easier to make so this is more of a lead generation funnel which also drip feeds information about our company and eventually leads into a more a hard like a funnel that leads to a sales call like that so I'll give you an example so this while you're pulling that up question are you pixeling people and then retargeting them around the internet of course heavily so can you explain how that works for people yes so I'll I'll show you exactly an exact example of it just to give you a feeling for it so when someone lands when someone finds this video on YouTube okay this is called how to prioritize ideas in meetings fast um it's a really good detailed video um with templates with all that kind of stuff one of the templates we put basically behind an email wall but we wouldn't even need to and we tell them to go here when they click here this is like a random landing page made in clickfunnels I mean how long would it take someone to make this landing page 20 minutes we don't I don't see you I don't see it oh yeah sorry a random landing page a really simple one look what's even funny about this is that nobody on my team even put an AJ and smart logo on here so it's like it's and there's no way in hell you're even finding this website anywhere else so this is a perfect example of a funnel it's just living on its own somewhere out in the middle of nowhere so this is this page has a Facebook pixel on it and this allows us to know this person who's using Instagram or Facebook uh or any meta product was interested enough in this video the previous one I just showed to go to this page so even if we don't have their email address we're we're going to be able to show that person ads and see if they're interest Ed in other things that we're offering as well around the internet so the Facebook pixel allows us to say but by the way the Facebook pixel has gotten a lot less powerful since um yeah since they changes yeah exactly um but it still allows us to get some information but the main thing here is collecting their email address collecting their name and being able to give them this template and then being able to drip feed them emails that slowly warm them up to the other things like open them up to the universe of AJ and smart without you know website dumps it all in one go a funnel lays it out step by step that's really the difference it's all separate steps that you actually can't see so when someone fills this out they don't know that the next step is like a six email chain that we've already written two years ago um but that's a really simple like lead capture funnel or lead magnet uh that we would run from uh face uh from YouTube and then send those into a drip drip campaign well there's two different types of campaigns that they could go into actually one is that they could go into the funnel usually what happens when it gets more complex first we'll try to put them into this vssl funnel that will sell them a high ticket program from $7,000 to like $14,000 to any sort of Big Ticket ticket thing if we if we figure out that they have no interest in things like that and they're like not going to buy anything for more than a thousand then they go into campaigns like Black Friday so that email address will then be kind of marked and segmented as this person's not interested in high ticket this person's just a beginner or interested in low ticket Let's test them out again on Black Friday so we're just collecting email addresses even though it's like we're collecting email addresses and trying to Li trying to get the money back as quick as possible with the with the vssl funnel but then we have the template that you just saw there where we might not make money from that customer ever or it might be two years later so there's kind of different ways of looking at it um another type of very very successful funnel the most successful funnel we ever did um oh actually I'll just show you another thing so a lot of people have blogs and make content but they also don't know how to monetize people from the blogs and content so they just keep collecting leads but they're like I don't know I think collecting and hoarding leads isn't as interesting as being able to actually monetize them Quicky quickly so we also have a kind of unbranded or well separate from everything else blog which used to be called work shopper.com which is why the URL is still this uh and it's basically our SEO play but the SEO play where does it lead always let me guess the funnel exactly ugly disgusting funnel exactly and there's another um there's another type of funnel we'll lead them to within here um here's another funnel which you are aware of well well it's not exactly a funnel but it's it's a call to action where we can then funnel them into this training and that's joining a free community you're you are the expert there with your super successful Community um but we have one other thing uh which is a book funnel which is insane let's see if I can find work Shopper PL I don't even know if this thing works to be honest here we go let's see all right so I'm going to bring you so so here's a link out to a funnel this is a book funnel this is a free bookfunnel it's called and we've we've basically turned it off so we've increased the friction so high that it's not even useful anymore but you can Google book funnels nothing is more effective nothing like in marketing than holding a godamn book in your hand and this like all of the in all of the stuff you can learn YouTube channel for free all of the stuff that you can download PDFs whatever it's all out there people don't give a [ __ ] if you tell them there's a physical thing that they can have that has all of the information in it they'll a very large percentage of your audience will want that physical thing it doesn't don't even bother thinking of the logic behind it it just works and also it's easier to talk about a physical book than it is to talk about anything else now I told you this is kind of Switched Off so today what happens is you just buy it and then you get sent into our uh newsletter and then that newsletter sends you to that funnel that you saw but what it used to do is you would buy the book we basically were doing it for less than cost price so now we're charging I think close to cost price but it's we make no money from it um number one this book gives you [ __ ] tons of marketing because people love to post pictures of themselves holding books we didn't ask anyone here I'm pretty sure we didn't ask anybody here to do this I was laughing I was laughing to myself a second ago cuz I saw someone wrote thank you J ice cream really where does it say that top left keep going up there's a woman she like yes you're right [ __ ] um that's brilliant oh these are yeah so like this book now this page is outdated this has had like 250,000 downloads and like a ludicrous amount of actual physical copies shipped but initially again people didn't understand and the only point of this page was to collect the email address and bring people into a funnel and that funnel was called a 2K funnel uh which was a different type of funnel and since it's not going to work right now I have to explain it 2ka funnel is basically you go you buy you get the book either for free or you're paying a small price I think we had like two or something um then the next page is like hey your book is on the way it's going to take six weeks as we told you do you want to watch just the summary of the book now and that's the that's the video that teaches you about what's in the book plus gets you to sit down and listen to what we do and what we offer and also gets you to in this case because it's a 2ka funnel we actually um offer you something to buy right there and then which which was a course which is called the design Sprint master class which was €2,000 Euro so 2K I don't know what the a even stands for I can't even remember I don't know who invented the name of that thing um but the idea there is you actually get you know you're you're paying all for all of the Facebook ads for people to come in and then there's some extra little Elements which you can do where where you can liquidate the costs of the Facebook ads with a small upsell in between like selling a workbook after that first step so we did all of these steps it was crazy it's just so complicated the amount of physical shipping we had to do nearly killed us however the last step is hey you don't want to wait for the book here's a free training right now on everything based on the book it's I didn't come up with this idea it's genius and it worked so well and the only reason it's not switched on right now is that it's when it's switched on it's very explosive and requ and and creates a lot of also support questions like people uh the book the book arrived with a with a bend on it and all this stuff so we we now have like a company who helps us do that for our next book um and so yeah next time we'll next time we'll pay more attention to how difficult shipping is um for workbooks and for all this kind of stuff but yeah that's a different type of funnel you're collecting the lead guys printing stuff out for marketing showing people stuff showing you holding stuff sounds so cheesy and silly it works so godamn well it's unbelievable it's crazy um yeah there's a lot I mean this is a you only have 15 minutes left so I've got no time left because I got I got to go build some funnels you know what I'm saying it's funnel it's funnel time baby wiped yeah I should have cleaned myself before I come coming on the show um I'm trying to think I really want to give people as much value as possible um there are like there's a book called expert secrets and uh Secrets which I definitely recommend you guys read they're very good they really teach the the concept behind funnels I think um you think that all the big companies are not like for example you'll sometimes you look at this stuff and you're like it's not prestigious this style of marketing which is called direct response marketing it's not prestigious but some of your favorite brands use this exact type of marketing eight sleep uses this type of marketing ag1 uses this type of marketing uh mind you know magic mind they use this type of marketing you think these kind of cool Brands don't use it look at their emails look at the style look look where they're funneling you through look at the urgency they use look at the deals they use this style of direct response marketing is being used everywhere except okay sometimes not not by Apple maybe not by Google but occasionally they do use the miy concept which is epic which is that's that's the thing I'll end on is the mythy concept and that is free I'm actually going to show you ag1 uses it what is the word you just said it's mythy which is called most incredible free gift ever you kept saying it and I was like what is this Genius of a man saying so a mythy is most incredible free gift ever and it's about stacking one-time free gifts onto a current offer which you would think is like too cheesy to work but it works so well and dramatically increasing conversion rates to the max like this this is a1's most recent campaign where not only did they have their welcome kit and the travel pouches but they also added this ag1 D3 and ag1 omega-3 and they present these very clearly as free gifts they present it very clearly as a limited time offer you also might think well I'm an agency or I'm selling really high level [ __ ] there's no way that I can be doing stuff like this these are consumer products it's so much easier to do it with consumer products we are doing miffys to the max all over the place like when we're talking to a client and they're like okay there's this you know 200k deal and we really want to close it we say if you close it this year we'll give you an extra 30 licenses for your team things like this like it's about and that's a free gift and we'll also send you printed versions of the workshop as a free gift and and it's really so unbelievably powerful and I didn't know about it until last year now I see it everywhere the free gift concept again it's a QVC thing but a lot of these companies use it like all the time and it's always a limited offer and I got like look at just to show you how many of these emails I got uh just another example of it time is running out limited time offer uh so yeah and like they use urgency even though they obviously like they don't need necessarily to use urgency but at the same time they kind of do because it is a campaign and if you're doing a campaign if you're doing like a oneoff thing like this a lot of the like creativity at AJ and smart is what's the miy this time like that's one of the most common things you hear people talking about at AJ and smart when a new campaign is coming up it's like what are the miffys time is running out limit time offer and they're just presenting it in different visual kind of lineups but it's the same thing basically um yeah I don't know and somehow it doesn't feel that cheesy when they I don't think so yeah I don't think it feels cheesy I I feel like I actually want to have that thing yeah and it's yeah it's it's it's kind of it's like a line between cheesy and not cheesy but you just got to look at what companies like whoop also do it you know like get it now or buy this version of it and you get a premium band as a free gift things like this we'll give you uh 13 months instead of 12 months as a free gift if you buy during this period um Ed um endle one of the most like you know high brow digital design products for for this audio you know endel yeah they have they had such a hard hardcore free gift campaign uh last Black Friday which was you get 12 months of endle now instead of paying monthly and we give you an endle bag as a free gift by the way I bought it and I my bag never turned off but I forgot you know but I wanted the bag okay this uh I had high expectations for this pod but this this was beyond my wildest imagination thank you I hope your audience finds this somewhat valuable like some I know it's a bit of a surface level abstraction presentation of like all the funnel stuff but there's going to be some people in your audience who I think will dig much deeper into this topic now and maybe be excited and then there'll be loads of people who are like no this is like scammy [ __ ] and I'm never going to look at it and copyrighting sucks and all that kind of stuff and it's all I hate that and I hate that J ice cream guy you know why do you keep bring him on the Pod yes thank thank you for having me back even though I've been a little bit you you've given a gift to thousands of Founders listening to this I really do think this is going to make a really really really really big difference uh in their businesses and I think uh if I'm listening to this build some funnels like go have some fun build some funnels um and and look at look at other people's funnels go to Facebook ad Library type in your competitor's name names and click on their ads and see if they're running funnels seriously that's one of the best ways to learn what funnels to run for your industry see what other people are running for their industry BL blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah funnels you have any uh plugs at the you know what do you want people to do um um oh I definitely want people to check out our new website and thank uh my team for it because they put so much hard work into it uh J smart.com we redesigned it we went more in the direction of what Greg uh recommended which is the more hold Co style so thanks for you know kind of you know Greg is the is the Pioneer and I was reluctant um but we've redesigned the whole AJ and smart ecosystem so check that out uh there's nothing to buy I just would like you to say nice things about it on Twitter so I can uh tag or screenshot that and show my team because they worked so godamn hard on it so if you see anything nice on the website maybe you could screenshot that and tag me on uh XJ I cream and I will show this to my team that would be amazing and what would also be amazing is if you liked comment liked and comment you could subscribe too but like and comment just because the more you do that the more viral this video will go go and the more I think it'll change people's way of creating startups so I and and and and a free gift Yes actually and to be really honest you know people think it's like a thing you know oh common whatever this episode only exists because uh so many people commented asking us to do it to the point where you were like saying on Twitter yeah people are actually getting annoyed about the fact that this episode isn't happening and then I felt actually a little bit like of pressure that I didn't want to let your audience down so it actually really works I was reading the comments and I was like oh [ __ ] I can't just offhand say that I'm going to do something to your audience and then not do it because they [ __ ] they don't forget totally and I and by the way people who will comment I look at every every single comment that you comment and people were commenting I want that like Workshop uh for funnels I want that workshop for funnels and I was like screenshotting every single one and I was whatsapping yeah he sent me a lot of these screenshots and I was like bro get on the Pod yes get on the Pod well I hope it was valuable please let us know um you know because again uh because I don't have this like I'm not teaching this thing if you have questions in the comments of

okay last last question before we move on to the uh the next startup idea biggest thing you learned from Mark Zuckerberg Zuckerberg shadowing him for hundreds of hours this is the key to what makes him so unique so the fact that he is is this extreme humility and amazing self-awareness so he knows when he doesn't know something and he doesn't just go in to learn it he gives himself or he used to and I I don't I'm not close to him anymore but he would really put himself in a position of extreme humility and he had no ego in the fact of oh I don't know this thing I have to posture like I know it he'd be like I don't know this thing and it's vital and um and I learned this firsthand [Music] because okay we got Sarah Lacy on the Pod she's an idea machine and I I was emailing her before this I was like come with ideas I'll give you 30 minutes and she's like I don't need 30 minutes you know I'll see you there in a few so thank you Sarah for for coming on the Pod and and sharing some of your ideas with us it is my pleasure um I you know it's really anyone who has built several companies knows like the fun part is coming up with ideas like we can all come up with ideas like the shitty part is actually trying to build them so I am uh fortunately at a stage in my career where I can just come up with with ideas all right should we get into it let's go so where do you want to start do you want me to just pitch you my ideas is that how this works yeah you you share your ideas and I will yeah we can just talk about if we like it we don't like it how we'd start it yeah I love it all right so I was thinking about this um the the my last startup that I did um which you know had uh you know a lot of successful startups always have these near death experience es I think I had near um you know generational wealth huge success with it and always would just grab the uh defeat out of the jaws of Victory um but uh it was this company called chairman me it was started as chairman mom and you know we we went on a lot of sort of pivots and iterations but what the part of the company that I loved the most was during the pandemic when women were really stuck at home and employee resource groups which had really worked to like boost women and give them solidarity and ways to get ahead like those were kind of gone because everyone was working from home um we started doing these really functional really effective online courses for women and we just nailed how to do online courses like we had 90% completion rates whereas online courses usually have 5% completion rates and we taught really tactical things by the best people in the world so like we had this negoti this course on negotiation taught by this coach who used the scientifically proven way to negotiate without a gender backlash and on average got people 30% increases in salaries like they were really like Navy Seals of courses to get women to the next level they worked they had huge results sounds great right do you know why that company failed because every day I had to do battle with women's internalized misogyny and it was like I was falling into a pit wrestling with Gandalf like it was I couldn't do it and that was ultimately why the company failed because women did not they've been so emotionally beaten up and conditioned by them that they didn't deserve to have more it was I I mean we we changed tens of thousands of women's lives but I couldn't reach millions of women's I could not convince them their lives could be better they could have more money and it was terrible but that's the reality so I give all that as a preamble because I think what someone should do is build an equivalent for tween girls because right when girls go into adolescence is when they start losing their confidence um and there's all these studies about this um actually always the uh the tampon and Pad company did a commercial about this for Super Bowl one year and it was like this run like a girl campaign people should Google this if they haven't seen it because it's stunning they ask like little girls they well first they ask asked like older girls post adolescence what it's like to run like a girl and they're like everyone's like making fun of girls and stuff they ask young girls they're like running all out and they're badass and like it is a drop off in confidence and belief in yourself right when you hit adolescence that's when the internalized misogyny starts I think if we could have a program in school that's like a pre-mba entrepreneurship confidence program not stem because stem's great but that doesn't teach you how to negotiate how to have selfworth how to ideate but if you had that in schools before they hit the confidence Rock Bottom um I think in a generation it would transform female leadership and I think it's one of those things that I guarantee you in 20 or 30 years whenever people would be like interviewing you know the Fortune 500 female CEO and they'd say how did you get there they'd be like well I did this program when I was in sixth grade and people say the Girl Scouts you know helped teach entrepreneurship but like really like you families go through it and they're like it's just m it's just a marketing scheme it's just a pyramid scheme um I think there's really cool ways that you could teach a lot of these fundamentals to kids then you could also even partner with local businesses to have a lot of this stuff in the wild now a lot of schools do entrepreneurship clubs but they're taught by teachers or they're taught by a parent who comes in they're not curriculum Rich they're not saying hey here's where you're going to stumble and here's where you're going to work through it and the reason I'm so confident in this is because in the pandemic when we were building all these courses and I was filming a lot of them in my home editing them doing a lot of office hours uh with these like world renowned instructors um it was during uh lockdown so like my kids were home and they were um they were a little bit young now they uh 11 and um and 13 but I mean they learned amazing negotiation skills they learned amazing executive function just by kind of being in the room and absorbing these things and asking me follow-up questions and um and now you know we own a a bookstore in Downtown Palm Springs which we kind of we live here part of the year and there's no bookstore so our family opened one and um both of my girls had have a business within the bookstore my youngest daughter makes these good luck pom pom monsters and if you buy $50 in books um you get one for free and then my older daughter makes these uh Pride cranes origami cranes and if you spend I think $30 you get one for free and I'm telling you people come in this store and they will grab an extra book to get one of those two items they sell out in like two days so I pay them like a dollar a month monster or I think a $150 crane my kids have like I will be regularly giving them $80 and it is not pity money the store is 100% made money and so we look at supplies we look at chains there's small businesses All Over America who would be willing to sell friendship bracelets baked goods cards all kinds of things kids could be making um so that's idea number one sh don't tell anyone but I've got 30 plus startup ideas that could make you millions and I'm giving them away for free these aren't just random guesses they're validated Concepts from entrepreneurs who built hundred million plus businesses I've compiled them into one simple database compiled from hundreds of conversations I've had on my podcast but the main thing is most of these ideas don't need a single investor some cost nothing to start I'm pretty much handing you a cheat sheet the idea bank is your startup shortcut just click below to get access your next cash flowing business is waiting for you essentially what I failed to build for women for tween girls so your vision of this is it like an online thing is it an inperson thing like H how does it how does it look like well I think the most scalable way to do it would be to do it as an online thing but something that happens in the schools and like I most schools now are actually like using a lot of technical tools whether it's Con Academy or other curriculums like it's pretty common right now that there's um private school curriculums that teachers are basically following a framework pressing play on um this lot of stim curriculums like this so um so I think you would slot into that model Okay cool so yeah I think the way I think that makes sense I think I would do it online like you put out the content online but the challenges happen IRL in schools so for example my elementary school for you know for boys and girls we were in order to teach entrepreneurship what they did and charity what they did was they handed us a bag of 20 chocolate bars and and said you need to sell these uh chocolate bars and each chocolate bar was $2 each the catch was we had to sign a paper that said we owe the school4 $40 so all of a sudden as a kid I'm like oh my God I'm in debt $40 like it's such a horrible feeling and you know uh you hated it um but you learn learned a lot um around like okay um debt is not good um okay now I need to sell this thing how am I going to sell this and then you there were some support structures around how to sell certain things and then the money went to charity as well so that could be an example of like I can imagine like a monthly challenge like that so that people can go down the world and learn as well but let me let me tell you the problem with that method in today's world and I I say this as someone who kid was just given 20 raffle tickets that she has to sell so we're in debt $200 if we don't sell these things um and so what's happening well in 2024 my 13-year-old is not going to go doortodoor selling things that doesn't work it doesn't work why does it not work first of all um people don't know their neighbors in the same way they used to um also we have ring doorbells people don't answer their doors if they don't know who it is and they don't come a lot of people don't have doorbells like we're not built for a world where kids can go door to-door selling stuff and so then what happens one of two things either the kid has parents like me who and by the way by the end of this episode I will sell you a raffle ticket you could win a RAF four um but like so you have someone like me who pings a bunch of people and is like hey Eli's to sell these raffle tickets or I just had the idea today I'm actually going to make her do a sales pitch on video and then I'm going to text it to our neighbors because I think they would love to do this but they're not going to answer their door and so but so that's not really teaching her anything is it that's just me being forced to handhold because otherwise I'm just buying the tickets because where else is she gonna sell them um when you know you always see kids walking into like around malls or something and um shopkeepers they consider it loitering they shove them away so it's like you know what are you supposed to do and I also think in the best of times all that does is teach kids sales and starting a business is a lot more than sales I think some of the most creative parts of starting a business are thinking about the product I mean obviously you agree because that's the whole point of your podcast but like ideating like what does this look did you find product Market fit what did you do wrong how do you pitch this to investors um there's so many pieces of this that are not sales and like I think sales is great because sales is like the number one thing that women sort of get socialized out of like there's there's so much talk about not enough women going into um engineering like women in sales is even more of a desert because um there's all kinds of gender Dynamics there only three less than 3% of female founded businesses ever do a million dollars in Revenue which I think is due to the socialization against sales so like I'm all for sales but I don't think it's the only skill and I don't think a world we grew up in exists anymore yeah so I think that's a really good point around on the door-to-door sales piece like what is the equivalent of door to-door sales and 2025 it's probably more like recording a video and posting it online and you know setting up a gum Road and and learning about how to sell and build a product on the Internet you know it's it's almost like the startup ideas podcast but for tween you know totally and yeah and ideas that they have are amazing I mean we always like the cliche in Silicon Valley is you want to find like the next Mark Zuckerberg who's never held down a job and is this like brilliant young nerd who has a Total Clean Slate well like okay let's go even earlier and here like what twins want um and I think the sales piece of it is like a like a typical like growth marketing funnel like these kids are so much better at digital tools than we are my 13-year-old can put any growth marketer a shame with her canvas skills so like I think do an Instagram campaign do a Tik Tok campaign do an email marketing funnel like the sales pitch is still coming from you but you're learning how to do it and you know also do that thing where you're like you're you know part of the where I see people who feel awkward about sales and aren't good at sales tend to go wrong is like they they send their first email or cold call trying to like close the deal and that's not what you're doing you're trying to close for a conversation so teaching kids like those fundamentals um it it's going to help them in every aspect of life because what are you doing when you're trying to get into college you're selling what are you doing when you audition for a role you're selling I mean you're trying to get um a summer job you're selling yourself um so I think this is something that would like absolutely transform um the demographics of the labor market because I'm telling you I spent 30 years as a journalist and I always asked people you know when they got interested in starting their own business and I can't tell you how many boys told me about their damn paper route or their yard business or about you know their side hustle they did or you know stories like Tony Shay selling pizza for a dollar this is something that male CEOs and male entrepreneurs have always been doing but we don't the equivalent for the girls is they're selling you know pyramid scheme chocolate bars for the Girl Scouts and setting up a stand with you know a little uniform and a required skirt on like I think we can do better for girls yeah and I I think we can do better for everyone is you know I think uh no I think I think the boys would be jealous they weren't allowed and and there's no reason it should be gender binary but honestly like if I were starting it my goto Market would be initially for girls because I think that is the pain point and I think you know I've just I've learn one thing I've learned the hard way with entrepreneurship is like um the riches are in the niches we always think by by narrowing Something That We're restricting but we're not like how many people shop at Forever 21 who are not 21 um we you know by being super specific I think you speak really directly to someone and then you know other people will want to be part of it like when we started chairman mom from day one 30% of our customers were not moms like it never precludes people if they want that thing um and I think it it's it sends such a clear value of what it is so I actually probably would start it um aimed at girls but you know like the girl scouts or whatever else say like it's open to everyone and you know and not uh discriminate but I think there's I bet there is public money you could get from public schools to roll this out and it would be a guaranteed Revenue stream um you know that any Elite boarding schools or private schools there is a dad who would write a check for that thing if their daughter was getting a heads up on entrepreneurship I think you'd make a ton more money than I made trying to sell it to uh corporate women sadly I was just doing some quick Googl like Girl Scouts does a billion does wow they do over a billion dollars a year in Revenue they make more money than Oreo makes that's amazing and this cookies aren't even around all year all year long it's crazy that's crazy yeah but so so I'm I'm in on this idea I'm in like I think uh I think it's a great one I think it would work I think it resonates I think the wi now is here also you would get magazine cover stories about it because of the issues with girls because of the things they could be doing you could do an annual like you know demo day in all of these communities that everyone would feel great about sponsoring and coming to I mean it's just one of those feel-good things people want to be a part of and it's it's where people could like they people could virtue virtue signal and still actually meaningfully support young women at the same time and if you were so the only thing that challenges me on this idea is the funding piece of it you know it's like uh you just said the Girl Scouts does a billion dollars I don't think there's any issue with the funding piece of it I think you have so many comps you have so many comps in uh companies like everyone from blackbot to like all kinds of like private curriculums that sell into schools like the reality is school not even just Public Schools one of my daughters goes to Catholic school and like they don't have the budgets for custom curriculum so what the teachers are doing is buying private curriculum and teaching it in the classes I think there is actually I think 20 years ago you'd be right I think now there is such a pathway of getting things into schools and there's so much money and budget for it not on you know a maybe a per unit basis but you know there's a lot of schools in the country I think what you need though is you need a CEO who sold into that before right I think if you had a CEO who sold into that before has connections there I actually think it's the funding piece of it is like a no-brainer you'd probably do a seed round build it get a proof of concept do one series a and in five years it would go public like snowflake I think you would need one funding round I wonder I I also wonder like I'm not a huge fan of cold emailing but I imagine a lot of these teachers Pro like you probably can get their email addresses and if you did a really really like tight cold email campaign with like maybe like a selfie video from one of the girls talking about her experience and um and and and you know just very tight I I I actually bet these people are not getting hit up that much um with with high value like value ad content that are actually going to make their jobs easier in a lot of way way right like they're looking for this stuff aren't they yeah no they absolutely are and I think that you could have campaigns where you could say either this is what it costs and you make it like as cheap as possible and just go for volume and then say here's what it cost if the school can't afford that you know we can do a fundraising thing you could even have you could run programs where uh local businesses or families sponsored it and and part of the costs were paid for by the proceeds I mean you could get really really creative on how to do this because it's software right you're not hiring a teacher to do this um you know you're you know you have like 80% gross margins on those online courses so it's also something that can be done and can be scaled up and down you know you can have more support at high-end boarding schools where we're facilitating a demo day or making intros to you know people in the community but you could also do a barebones version of it for um you know inner city schools where it's you know maybe like maybe Nike wants to support it for a thousand schools I mean I think you could get really creative with how to pay for it and because it's online courses um there's also like amazing recurring Revenue because once you're in a school and people are getting value it's not going to be ripped out of that school in in the past I I know you've you know cuzz you've you've been in media and you've probably done a lot of sponsorships like do you have any advice for people on how to sell like a Nike like how do you know because people probably hear that and they're like that's so Out Of Reach I don't even know how to do that um quick ad break let me tell you about a business I invested in it's called boring marketing.com so a few years ago I met this group of people that were some of the best SEO experts in the world they were behind getting some of the biggest companies found on Google and the secret sauce is they've got a set of Technology an AI that could help you outrank your competition so for my own businesses I wanted that I didn't want to have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I didn't want to depend on ads to drive customers to my businesses I wanted to rank high in Google that's why I like SEO and that's why I use boring marketing.com and that's why I invested in it there's so so confident in their approach that they offer a 30-day Sprint with 100% money back guarantee who does that nowadays so check it out highly recommend boring marketing.com you know I think I mean look there are two reasons that I have done been able to do anything that I've done in my career and it's two superpowers that I have and the first is networking I meet people constantly I am never too old or too networked to meet more people or really engage in those networks and um you know I think that there is an art to networking that is not standing around at um a cocktail party being awkward but building relationships and building relationships with people without um an intended thing you want out of it um and I think that in maintaining those relationships over a long time and being there and showing up and being genuinely interested and you know building relationships and n works when you don't need to frankly um and then tapping them and making asks of them when you do need to and um you know I think every piece of that are things that people tend to fail on um you know they don't make networks when they don't need them and then they if they have them they're squeamish about making asks of them whereas like we all you know we love when people we care about ask us for things because it makes us feel good and makes us feel like we can ask them a favor in the future so I think um that a huge one and I think if you start especially for people in their early 20s start building your network now and it doesn't have to be with the CEO of a company it can be with someone who's a peer because y'all are all going to come up together and then those people are going to wind up being the people who are decision makers in the future um you just don't know who's going to turn into what job and what you're going to need from someone and like case in point with this idea maybe like right now I'm me you know if I'm in my early 20s thinking I want to work at a startup maybe I don't think my friend who is going to school to be a superintendent would necessarily be a great contact but lo and behold here's my startup idea I need to get into schools like anyone can be a great contact for you because you don't know who they know and you don't know what they're going to be and you don't know what you're going to wind up building um so I think that's number one and I think if you've been doing your job in tra Network then I bet you know someone who knows someone senior at Nike I guarantee you could find someone senior at Nike or a connection to them in my network um number two the second thing that I always was really good at it I don't think I realized till later in my career how powerful it was and why is Story I mean one of the best books about story ever written is Lisa kon's wired for story and it basically breaks down the Neuroscience of story and how we have been wired since caveman days to respond to story in a way that we are are by a ically wired to our heart to race blood to rush for to our thighs because we know we're going to have to run away um you know think about how often like the you know the downside of this is when people have anxiety and they're like oh my God I know that it's not rational and it's like yeah it's not rational it's because like your brain is telling your body a story of what's going to happen to you if you sat on stage in front of thousands of eyeballs looking at you and have to give a keynote um so I think that story is the most powerful tool I think it's the reason that most women who raise large amounts of venture capital do not come from a math background but come from a media background because it is like the great leveler so I think those two things right you find the right contact and then you put together the right story um how is this going to make how is this going to transform Nike how what heartstring are you pulling what you know you mentioned getting a kid in the video I mean I absolutely do that there was a brilliant marketing campaign for this nonprofit that um I think does uh water it it helps provide water and they went to this rather than saying this is a huge number of people who go without water and isn't you know isn't it staggering there's this many people on the Earth who don't have fresh water no one cares we don't care about numbers we just don't we have too much [ __ ] in our own life right but they to they showed one boy and and and as a result in this one Village like the bulk of kids would not make it to their sixth birthday because of water so they took this one boy in this Village and they when he was five years old took him around the world completing his bucket list because he was gonna die at six statistically and it is the most moving three minutes you will ever watch and even if you've seen it even if you know the ending you will still cry you can't not because it is so designed to grab you in this evolutionary way that we all that we all do and so it's like you do the equivalent of that and like of course Nike's gonna say yes also like you build like a marketing campaign with them where they can talk about what they're doing for girls it makes everyone at the company feel good um maybe the what you know maybe it's like an like the equivalent of the ernston young entrepreneur of the Year award does Nike do the national Gala of all of these amazing tiny little 10 and 12 year old badasses who've built these things and do they you know hold it in New York and give the number one winner like an internship I mean come on there is so much media they get out of that there's so much feel-good and like how much would it cost like a couple million dollars how many seats could you get with a couple million dollars they could make a massive massive difference this conversation is reminding me about like the first time I ever went to New York City as like an 18-year-old I'm from Canada and when I was in some of these meetings as like a kid basically and I heard people talk like you were talking it it it it shattered you know it shattered my world like it made me realize that thinking big and mindset is such an important part of making things happen um you know we in our minds we're always kind of like a lot of us um are like yeah it would be nice to get it I don't know if I can actually close it I don't know if I can actually get their email I don't know if I can actually but you know you're right when you actually like lay it out and you're like okay it's really just story and people and it's interest of that right I mean it's like uh you know every day what can you do that will be a favor to the Future you who's going to be in this position and need to sell Nike who can you meet what can you learn what can you put in place I I cannot tell you the numbers with both of my startups I was building the numbers of future uh favors to the Future me that I had no idea I was doing in my 20 or 30 20s or 30s that were company changing moments in you know my 30s or 40s before we move on to the next idea because I need to hear your next idea because you're a Legend um can you give one quick story of someone who you met maybe ear you know in your early 20s or in your 20s that ended up being like you would have never expected that person would be so valuable in your career I mean I have a hilarious one which is uh Mark Zuckerberg like I when I was at business week I first called Mark Zuckerberg when Facebook had just closed the Peter teal round of funding and he had just moved to Palo Alto and I called the company and he answered the phone like that's how long ago it was now he had already raised money from from Peter he was in the valley but you can't imagine at that moment how much even when David Z did the $500 million Greylock route I made a bet with another CEO um over a fancy din dinner anywhere in the world because he insisted not only the bet wasn't even will Facebook go public and be worth 500 million which seemed unbelievable to everyone the BET was will they be out of business by this time last year next year like people were so burned um because this is the other thing we're hardwired for is pattern Rec nition and people were so burned from the dotom bubble and they were so burned by things like Friendster no one believed in this company and um so I started you know building a relationship with Mark and like covering him as a journalist and getting interested when he was 19 and then you know within a couple years I was one of the only two journalists in the world who had access to him yeah cuz he trusted you yeah cuz and and he also knew it's like I thought there was something interesting about him when no one else did I thought he was a remarkable person when no one else did and again it's like Network it's all relationships like we don't like it was I was just finishing um uh Indra no the uh former CEO of Pepsi was just finishing her autobiography this or her Memoir this morning and she says at the end like so many amazing things happen when you were the CEO of a multi-billion dollar company and I knew and I when I left my Friendship Circle was gonna shrink because those people as nice as they were weren't interested in me they were interested in what I could do for them and so people never underestimate when you're someone who believed in them before the entire world wanted a piece of them um so I mean that's an obvious one and my first book which Mark was which was about the rise of Web 2.0 and Mark was one of a handful of people that I spent hundreds of hours uh shadowing um you know I mean I that was my Advance on that book was one of the it was like the second biggest advance in Business Week history at that point and allowed me to buy a house in San Francisco that I still have to this day so that one phone call paid a lot of dividends okay last last question before we move on to the uh the next startup idea biggest thing you learned from Mark Zuckerberg Zuckerberg shadowing him for hundreds of hours well I mean this is unfortunately this is kind of something everyone knows about him now but um I think if it's every biggest thing that nonobvious thing that you learned well so let me give you the Twist on it because I do think this is the key to what makes him so unique so the fact that he is you know he talks a lot about this like every year there's a big thing he wants to learn right and he like throws himself into it and I know a lot of CEOs who like talk a big game about always wanting to be learning or whatever and growth mindsets have become super popular a after that but I think think the piece that markk does that other people don't always see from the outside is this extreme humility and amazing self-awareness so he knows when he doesn't know something and he doesn't just go in to learn it he gives himself or he used to and I I don't I'm not close to him anymore but he would really put himself in a position of extreme humility and he had no ego in the fact of oh I don't know this thing I have to posture like I know it he'd be like I don't know this thing and it's vital and um and I learned this firsthand because at one point I was like why does this person giving me so much access because really at the beginning he was like why do we need press like there's no one is in Facebook's audience who's reading business week like he was pretty skeptical of the whole thing and he didn't talk to other journalists and there came a point where I was just like why am I getting so much access this is so bizarre and um and so I asked him that question and he said uh he said said because I've noticed when I'm talking to you I go in not thinking I'm going to say things and then I suddenly start telling you things and you're so much better at people than I am and so as you're asking me questions and I'm telling you things you need for your job I'm trying to figure out how you're doing that wow isn't that amazing so amazing I love that okay so part of what I'm doing now post uh chairman me um I I do not have another venture funded startup in me and I also don't want to become a VC because I'm too opinionated and too controversial and I couldn't back someone who was a sociopath which is kind of required in that that field so um like all people in my position who can't do either of those things anymore um I've become a consultant and the thing that I have found people want to pay me an absolute absolute Fortune to do for them and this is not a pitch because my time is completely booked is help them figure out what is the book that they should write that only they can write that the world would want who's the best agent for them what is the process like how do you build your marketing channels in anticipation of this um I absolutely love doing this because writing books has been super life-changing for me and it is an amazing thing to have this tiny piece of your soul in the library of Congress forever it's just it's something that hasn't been disintermediated and it takes four years and it's like I talked to all of these tech people and they're like can't we shortcut this and it's like you really can't you really can't so every time no matter who you are no matter gender where you live anywhere people walk in a bookstore they see a book they loved meant something to them I don't care if it's twilight or good to great they all do the same thing which is they pick it up and they hold it to their heart and they tell someone they're with about why it meant so much to them there's nothing else that has that impact still but here's the thing you read a good de great you read a wired for Story by Lisa cron which I me mentioned earlier you read a Tim Ferris book you feel like as you're reading it okay I got it I'm gonna do all this stuff it's going to unlock every problem in my life all problems will be solved everything's going to be great you fin the book and maybe maybe you remember remember one or two things from that book maybe you apply them to your life maybe you do it for a short period and then forget but it's actually really hard to apply a framework whether it's a wellness framework um something like Atomic habits or you know something that is more substantive like a business book a career book it's really hard to consistently remember what was in that book book that you read and keep applying it to your life and no one has the time to reread a book because there's always so many books coming out and so you will just forget and I've talked to so many people where they're like oh my God I totally forgot about the Hedgehog strategy and good to great I need to go back and reread that book what do they do I think there's an amazing opportunity for AI here to build coachable AI Bots based on authors and I am so skeptical about Ai and so many things but I think the detail and the rigor and the framework and the word count of a book I think if they had lectures speaking gigs online newsletters you know the more things that speak to that worldview the better I think it's a rare case where you would extend someone's influence and not in any way cannibalize the underlying product I still don't think it's a shortcut because I know a lot of people who are like instead of a book can I do this and it's like I still think there's why a book is hard is it's the the thought process it's the interrogation it's figuring out what have you not thought for it's the research of where does this framework fit in the world who else has researched this I don't I think that's what you can't shortcut because that's also all filtered through your life experience and your Genius as the as the author I think AI cannot shortcut that um but I think what it can do is it can extend you so for instance um Lisa who I've mentioned four times now if she were Beetle Juice she would have appeared um she is like a story coach to the stars and when my partner uh Paul Carr was gonna write his first novel he' published many non-fiction books but writing a novel is totally different he redwire for story and was like oh my God this is genius I'm completely sold but I don't really understand how to apply this to what I'm doing I don't understand when am I doing this right when am I being specific enough when am I putting enough Blood on the page all the things that she talks about that make compelling story and so he reached out to her and was like do you do coaching and she's like I do but I have a really long wait list now he was someone cancelled he you know made a compelling case he was able to like skip her weight her weight list they've spent four years working together on multiple novels he's now on his third novel um but he the book wasn't enough he needed that back and forth and I think a lot of people feel that way when they read Adam Grant's book when they read Tim Ferris is book when they read you know any of you know brne Brown books I think the ability for these people to leverage themselves even as like a daily reminder with doing nothing more than everything they've already written being put in into a nice ux so I totally buy the premise by the way like I especially buy the premise by the way there's so many people working on this this is not even a super new thing because so people have asked me about it but I think the way I'm thinking about it is somewhat different but anyway go ahead yeah yeah I think uh the Insight is correct 100% I think the Insight around people are buying books from their favorite authors or new authors and they it's an incredible experience and even the best books you know like the ones you mentioned you kind of lose you know you forget and you and you there needs to be a better way to get you in the habit now I always think about this is kind of old school of me but I always think about like who who's who builds the best community in the world or who or or one of them or or who's done a really good job at least of of spreading the gospel literally it's like religion like church and if you think about like the Bible like literally you know in Christianity for example every Sunday like you come you listen to you know what what what you're reading or Judaism uh every you know every every week you you learn about a section of the Bible and that piece that missing piece is what brings you back to actually reread the book make it a part of your um Zeitgeist and so I think that Insight is so right and the other Insight that you have which I think is really right is the why now around AI provides an ability to extend now the question I have is like how does what does the extension look like um yeah so I think what it's not is a newsletter because I think most authors um and there are many that do this really well and it's this is definitely like a core strategy I use when I'm helping an author build a multi-year strategy right you send a new newsletter and it's like hey remember this thing or like hey here's something you could try today and those are really interesting ways of continuing to like bring back those habits or Frameworks or you know Adam Grant might send a thing that's like hey here's a new piece of research that backs up what I wrote about and give and take and I think that's great but I think what you need is like a daily prompt like the equivalent of when I wake up in the morning you know I'm gonna look at my email I am G to see if anyone has texted me and then the next thing I do is I go do like the basic four daily New York Times puzzles and it's great because it is not a Time suck like there's really no archive on most of them and if there is I've already like done them so it doesn't matter but it's like I'm gonna spin maybe anywhere between five and 20 minutes I'm going to feel really great about myself I'm because I won't feel like I just do Doom scrolled I'll feel like I did something that made me feel smart and the app is like okay see you tomorrow it kind of kicks you out so like like Paul my partner has so many issues where he like has a smartphone then gets rid of it then has it then gets rid of it because he's like I get sucked in and it's a t time waste but the one app he always has is the New York Times game app because you really can't get sucked in um and so I think it's a similar thing I think you have your coach and you know every you can set the time you know if you're like a nursing mother maybe 2 a.m. is the right time for you you know what is the time you would naturally have that downtime and you get a prompt from your AI coach being like hey have you thought about this today or asks a question like let's see say it was um let's say it was something about being more in the moment and being more you know grateful maybe like that's what you want to work on like maybe you get a that's like um you know you need to put down your phone for the next hour or you know right now pick what hours you're gonna not be on your phone or uh you know um you know right now write down like five things that you're grateful for or you know let's say it's like a you know whatever something around Fitness like you know what is your plan that you can commit to for working out this week and by the way five minutes a day is totally appropriate because it's still putting you in a habit um you know it there's it it can be totally customized like I think if James Clear was doing this you know maybe you pick the different Atomic habits thing you want to do I remember when I was at um chairman me one of the things that I took was like you know in making like daily cold sales calls which is like no one thinks is fun I don't even think it's fun and I'm like I love sales um and it's like I had a spe specific time a specific day I would have like a specific like treat or beverage for that and I would like say out loud every day when I get home after dropping the kids at school I'm G to go sit in my Airstream with some mint tea and I am gonna do 10 sales calls and it's like so it's like I had that discipline for I don't know two weeks like what if James Clear was popping up in my phone saying have you done it how's the mint tea it's a great idea it's a great idea I think uh if I were if I was doing it if I was building an MVP here I think the way I would do it is first of all I'd be selling to these authors so i' I'd figure out you know what is the smallest thing that they'd pay for so I'd go i' reach out to the maybe not James clear to start but like B's and C's first get their feedback um then I would try to create an AI Avatar bot basically um and it doesn't need to be personalized from day one I think the way the to make it easier on yourself whoever ends up building this you could you could have it so that like on day one after you finish the book this happens on day seven this happens and everyone's kind of based on that in the future you could personalize it based on you know your goals and other things like that um and then and and I think with the of like AI avatars and stuff like that you can make something that looks like James CLE that talks like James CLE that feels like James clear that could be really exciting to people imagine having James clear as your coach like that's so cool yeah and really I mean when James Clear is coaching someone I bet he's saying the same things 80% of the time and I bet he would be thrilled to be able to extend himself and say the same things like another great person to do it would um Kim Scott it's like if you had a Kim Scott bot which Rhymes which is nice like what if they came in every day okay you had a great day didn't you yeah okay what conversation did you need to have that you you know wriggled out of because it felt too uncomfortable like what a good prompt for a CEO it's like oh my God you're so right I let myself off the hook for that I did it this is a reminder I need to go do that um and I you know I would I mean you know from the the Nike comment earlier I would start with James Clear I think the biggest authors are always looking for ways to leverage themselves and they're really likely to roll a dice on something like that um especially and I mean it has to be business authors it has to be tech people you know it has to be people who have like that following but like and the people who do multiple books like awesome put a QR code in the next book you know have a special edition that you could sell where the first you know thousand people get this you know get the beta into the Kim scottbot and after that you have to you uh you know have to be on a wait list or something you would drive so many bulk sales you would drive so many First Day sales which is like the the best bet of getting on the New York Times bestseller list if you said everyone who pre-orders gets to be gets the Kim Scott bought for free including in their Book price it only takes 10,000 books to get on the New York Times bestseller list that would have a meaningful meaningful difference in what a book does at Market totally and you can do a REV share like don't even charge James clear or whoever anything just be like I yeah nope and um because here's the it's like I would yeah you could do because you think about like the I mean like AI is a cost suck so you have to think about that but I bet the Publishers if you were driving sales would give you part of the royalties or would give you some amount of money like right now at the store when we do things like well there's a lot of places where we're we'll do like the only signed copies and so the Publishers will like ship books to that author in La they'll sign them and the publisher will pay for them to be shipped to us like Publishers have um discretionary marketing budgets for this kind of thing and so yeah I think probably the money could all come from the publisher um and you wouldn't have to charge the author but I will say like authors will 100% pay for it I mean most Business book authors I mean I know because I am paid to help Business book authors do a really good job like they invest in publicists they invest in people like me they invest in ghost writers they're giving a cut to their agent um you know most authors will buy copies of their own book that they're giving to um you know schools or they have in their office they give someone a copy um so most authors business authors are doing it because they want to give back because they want to leave Legacy because they want everything they've worked for in their career to kind of add up to a philosophy or something at the end of the day or because they're going to get a lot of other things out of it like you I mean I am Living testament to like I don't think I ever earned royalties on any of my books because I'm such a good salesperson I got massive advances but every one I wrote I got so many monetary career benefits whether it was speaking gigs whether it was board opportunities whether it was you know whatever whatever I mean you name it it is there's such a moat to getting a published book out there that even with self-publishing even with everything else that there's all these benefits down the line from having written a book so most of people who um you know who who take the time to write a book who are at that level it's not a monetary game for them and they don't want to leave they want they don't want they want regret minimization and if they've taken four years of their life to get this book into the world that represents what they think and what they know and what they've built in their career you think they're going to bulk at spending um a couple extra dollars or pennies per copy on a subsidized chatbot no because they're also going to think it's cool totally you g you you gave us the sauce these are two good ideas a Zuckerberg Story come on this is this is better than expectations Sarah where plus a cat a dog like you know if you're listening to this on audio you missed out because the you know the YouTube animal appearances were were iconic um Sarah where uh where where do you want to plug like what do you want to plug if anything you I'm so delighted that for the first time in my life I don't actually need anything from anyone nor do I have anything to plug but if you I can always come up with something so if you uh want to buy books not from Amazon you can go to best bookstore.com and buy them from us we also have an incredible newsletter I read about I don't know anywhere from three to 10 books a week so I always have amazing recommendations of both fiction and non-fiction books so check out best bookstore.com and sign up for our newsletter and we also if there's any CEOs listening one thing we do which I love is we we do corpor corporate Book Fairs so it's like the Scholastic Book Fair but like for your company and at conferences we'll do book uh popups and we've done that some for some of the largest uh software companies on the planet and you even people who are heads of huge companies when you show them a table of books and they can take anything they want and we'll even ship it home for free it's like $30 from your company is there's no other way for that to make someone look happier so those are my plugs more books and more hands did you know that there are 19 research studies that show if you read fiction you become more empathetic you can understand what other people need and desire you can get along with more different kinds of people there are so many studies that show that reading fiction especially for people anyone building a consumer product trying to sell to people trying to understand the empathy that you gain from that is absolutely a career Advantage so that is always my soapbox because there's so people are like I don't have time to read fiction I gotta slay and it's like you will slay as a result of reading fiction totally folks you're you're sleeping on fiction uh I'll include those links in the description so it's easier if if you if you miss that um go and do that and Sarah until next time this has been a lot of fun [Music]

1) Why directories are hot right now:
• More content online = higher need for curation
• People trust well-curated directories
• Less SEO competition than other niches

2) How to find directory ideas:
• Use Google Keyword Planner
• Look for high search volume, low competition keywords
• Find available domain names that match or are close to target keywords

3) Building your directory:
• Use no-code tools (like Unicorn Platform) for speed
• Start simple - focus on listing items, not features
• Use AI to generate initial content and structure

4) Promoting your new directory:
• Share on relevant Reddit threads (carefully!)
• List your directory in other directories
• Engage on social media, especially Twitter
• Focus on SEO after initial validation

5) SEO strategy for directories:
• Start with ~10 high-quality articles
• Use tools or AI to generate SEO-optimized content
• Focus on internal linking and site structure
• Add trending items quickly to capture search traffic

6) Monetization strategies:
• B2B sponsorships and featured listings
• Affiliate links (especially for high-ticket items)
• Sell anonymized data or insights
• Charge for premium listings or access
• Brand sponsorships for established directories

7) The power of directories for SaaS:
• Easier to win SEO traffic than direct SaaS marketing
• Use directories to funnel traffic to your main product
• Consider buying relevant directories for instant traffic

8) Realistic expectations:
• $5K MRR achievable as a side project
• Up to $20K MRR with focused effort
• Million-dollar potential exists (but rare)

9) Why start with directories:
• Lower failure rate than SaaS
• Faster dopamine hits (traffic, first sale)
• Great way to learn digital product development

Pro Tip: Don't fall in love with one idea. Launch multiple directories, see what sticks after 30 days, then double down on winners!

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
in this episode John Rush breaks down how you should start an online directory how to idate for an online directory how to build an online directory using Ai and how to grow an online directory using Ai and SEO and he just walks through the entire process people are making 5K 10K 15K 20K a month uh with these online directories they're super easy to create he thinks it's one of the lowest risk uh ways to start a startup I'll let you decide enjoy the [Music] episode we got John Rush the king of directories on the Pod you've heard it you've heard him here before but today is a special episode because what are we learning today John well we'll learn how to come up with ideas for directories how to validate them before you build them how to build them and how to work on SEO once you build them so basically all three important steps you have to build successful directories and why you should care about this is we're kind of entering this like Golden Era of directories we're starting to see them be more and more popular uh people want curation and directories provide that so if you're looking for your next startup idea directories is a great place to start and uh I'm excited to to get in with this I just like dive deep in directories I haven't done this with you I figured you might as well do it publicly yeah that's there smart that's 100% correct so uh just to add on that the Reon directors are so big now and they will be much bigger in the future is that as there's more content on the internet the quality of the content becomes more important and I think directors are soling this pretty well because people trust directories if it's a good directory they trust it that it's a Well curated content and it has some reviews ratings and the quality is high and the person running it understands the space and picks the right things there so I think people will be Outsourcing the decision making for for the content to the directories from Google because now they ask Google and that's uh that's becoming more and more relevant as we see that the top search results of the Google are mostly dominated by all the hacks all right well let's start with step one how do we find a directory idea that uh is worthwhile to go after yeah so there are many ways of doing it but the best way is to start based on keyword research so the keyword research is a way to see whether people search for certain keywords and certain phrases and even if you think that certain idea is great but often other people might not think so and you can figure out whether that's true or not by seeing what Google says about that and and Google has this tool called Keyword Planner that people usually use to plan their ads but you can also use that tool to see the traffic for directories not for director for keywords and I basically spend hours in that tool every day just throwing all random ideas into that tool and seeing whether there is traffic or not and I can show on a real example I have even an idea I want to test today and I will show you how I would test that idea actually right here on the P amazing amazing so while you're pulling that up today's episode uh it's going to be like a live cooking session like we're going to find an idea and we're going to go basically build this idea so if you're listening to this on audio might might be helpful to head to to to YouTube yeah so one thing we saw is that your podcast has been really great and it been it's been growing the startup ideas and the idea I got from this is that that's the hottest part of the whole startup Journey now is the ideas and I think the part people struggle the most with are the ideas and I think people search a lot for ideas on Google and to validate that I went to Google or I will go there now I don't some test before and and we come here and we say business ideas now you can remove the filter on us to see the whole world it's still in English so and now we're going to see whether people search for it and as you see a lot of people search for it business ideas is almost 1 million a month that's a lot and competition low uh this competition is is about the ads so people don't pay for the ads for this keyword but finding this domain name is pretty difficult because the next thing you have to think about about is like I have the keyword and I want to make directory and I want the domain name of my directory to match the keyword if there is a match then it's go like for example I had this directory called nextjs starters and it was exact match of the keyword exact match like letter to letter and I launched that and I open it back in three months and it has a lot of traffic just because it's it's perfect and it's do com in this case obviously this will be taken so I I go to GoDaddy and I see whether business ideas.com is taken and it's obviously taken so then I have the next group of uh keywords here I can s sort them and I can I can just take them one by one and test them small business ideas little business ideas online business ideas all of them and eventually uh just before the Pod I found one that was available which was the mean business ideas and I I bought it so the mini business ideas is a domain I will try why it's good so it's basically I will explain now how how the domain and the keyword works so the key part here is that the Google has made a change where in the old times Google would look at exact word match and now it it looks at the meaning more than the actual words and that's why you have this small business ideas here which is really high up here and basically can replay small with something else that's has the same meaning and if it's available you can take it and that's what I did so I tried tiny micro and then the mini was free so I bought mini business ideas for $9 I never buy expensive domains like it's always available just be more creative and find the one that's available so now I have the domain name main business ideas I have the the idea itself so the idea is the director of ideas that's pretty funny shh don't tell anyone but I've got 30 plus startup ideas that could make you millions and I'm giving them away for free these aren't just random guesses they're validated Concepts from entrepreneurs who' built hundred million plus business businesses I've compiled them into one simple database compiled from hundreds of conversations I've had on my podcast but the main thing is most of these ideas don't need a single investor some cost nothing to start I'm pretty much handing you a cheat sheet the idea bank is your startup shortcut just click below to get access your next cash flowing business is waiting for you and now I will go for the next step which is building the directory so there are many ways of building directories and the worst way of building directories is going into the code and I am a developer myself a lot of people think I'm a not a developer that's why I always promote no code but I've been coding for like 15 years and the reason I always say that you should start with no code is this when you do no code you start faster because you can use templates but that that's not the most important part the most important part is that once you launch you have to do marketing and marketing goes around marketing Pages marketing experiments AB tests and all those things and when you and also the blog and and and prog programmatic SEO and all those things are usually out of the box on most modern CMS or web Builders because they have thought about it that's why they built the whole systems and when you do that with nextjs or you hardcode that with PHP you don't really think about the future and maybe in the present you may find certain template too or boiler plate for that but then you'll have a lot of problems in the future when you have to do the other marketing work because everything has to be done manually and for example if you want to find somebody on appwork who will write certain pages for you and publish them now you can't do that because it's all in code so you will get some Google doc and you will convert that into code so it's all huge hustle and that's why it's even if you know how to write code and you're great at that it's 100% better to go with no code any tool but I obviously go with my own tool the Unicorn platform and let me switch the tab to the other tab now all right so here we are it's a unicorn platform like simple website builder that I pivoted into into directory Builder I would say because most directories or most websites built on unicorn now are directories and that's interesting and so we go here and we say create and we find the directories so here are the templates and people always try to over complicate things so I have this Discord group called directory makers and a guy asked me today like I want to make a directory for lawyers and I want to have this and this and this like 20 features and I say at the first launch of your directory the only thing that's important is the items like if you put the out the ratings and everything it will be empty because there will be no ratings there will be no users so all those features they don't make sense for new director so the only thing that makes sense for a new directory is a simple page with a name and items and everything else should come later in the month or even a year so that's why I always start with very simple directory first so usually it's um for example this one so this is probably the simplest one here so I pick this all right and I can actually simplify my work so I can ask AI to generate oh the directory for me and I say directory of meanie mini business which by the way is insane I had no idea you can do this oh really that's why I do things really fast like people always ask me what's your routine I'm like I use AI for everything but I I do moderate everything right so I understand the quality and I add it but I always use AI to start off Min I is for people who want to start a small site project St student in the hackers and another founder all right let's see so now it will basically help me to come up with the with simple things like a menu and the structure the text the subtitle like basically you could do this all by yourself too but why not to save time if you can yeah so it's suggest me to basically have uh the directory here and then to have uh featured ideas here which is pretty cool because this is uh so in the directory everything has to be taken into the into the prism of SEO so basically the more text you have the more items you have the more pages you have the more chance to score an SEO for those pages and and for example in this case if you have featured ideas uh there's High chance that you can score for SEO compared to just the ideas because ideas will be uh smaller items and featured ideas you can probably spend time and create longer Pages all right so it's pretty much almost done the work and okay now wa few more seconds where it's making the futter for me I guess all right so it's making this also FAQ so FAQ is pretty important yeah now it's done FAQ is really important too because in FAQ every Title Here is a possible question people put in Google that's why the way you usually do with this is is pretty straightforward so you go to Google and you try to search for something so you write how do I and then it suggests you all the other options that other people search for and that makes it obvious what exactly people search for and that's how you can basically for free understand what people search for then you put them here uh into this FAQ and you answer those questions and then there's a chance you can get traffic for this so I will I will show that which makes so much sense if you think about it right it's yeah it's so basic and obvious but you'll be surprised that almost Nobody Does it um some things look too easy and people don't try it because it's they kind of expect things to be complicated and then being valuable and if something is easy to do it feels like it's not valuable because everyone would be doing it so uh how to start yeah so here you see so how to start a business with no money how to start business as a teenager that's interesting I would never think of this how to start a business as a teenager and and that's very good keyword right because it's uh it's probably not served well because it's not obvious and you could cover that so now I do this research and I write down all these questions and then I go back to my uh page where I will cover them right so I go here and and I say I ask AI uh item for how to start business as a tager so I say work for AI and then now it says how to start the business as a teenager and now it puts the text so that's it so now I basically have a pretty high chance uh to score on this keywords and of course if I want to go further I will make a page that will have this title and full description but I usually don't recommend making pages right away because it takes more time to make a page than to make a fake item that's why start with this and then watch the queries in the search console and you will see whether you have any traffic for this keyword and if you have any traffic for this keyword then go ahead and make a page for that then you'll win more traffic so basically my whole approach with director is this you have to be doing as little as possible to validate all the assumptions and then the assumption that wins going to take more of your time and you invest proper human time into that and you make it really good because obviously AI is not as good as humans but it it's it's pretty good for these experiments but then you make it Greater with your own hands yeah so this is my article my my website and just to save time I will switch to the website I just made because it's pretty much the same but with the data yeah how I just made it before the the call so this is my directory the small business ideas and uh I have all the ideas here and and my goal is to have I know maybe 10 or 100 Sol ideas here and I looked at this keywords so I put small little size startup so every keyword you see here has been validated for traffic either directly or through indirect words and same for all the St in the FAQ so every question I have here is coming from from the method I just used so that's pretty much it and and here I have like feature business ideas so it all takes if it takes you more than one evening then you're doing it wrong because if it takes more than one evening you need to redo your method otherwise you're kind of riding on a small car on a on a slow car and you will never get really far with that so you have to make sure that you're moving fast because there's a chance that everything I've done will fail there's really high chance and maybe tomorrow or after a week I will figure out that this will not work that's why I usually bet for five six 10 ideas and I test them all the same time so that I remove the chance to be disappointed when one one idea fails that's that's pretty good approach I would say like don't do Just One Directory because it will be disappointing and you have to wait quite a lot for SEO to get in and to validate certain assumptions but if you have 10 of them then it's faster so now the next thing I do is once I built the directory I have to promote it somewhere so I I do few things so the first thing I do I go to Reddit and I search I just search in Google small bonus ideas Reddit when I do that I will see all the Reddit articles about that and then I go into those articles and I reply with my URL just have to be careful to not be banned and to not be banned you have to reply on articles where people actually ask for URLs and there are articles like that where people ask do you know places to find the ideas and then you put your url nobody going to hate you for that and there a lot of Articles like that so for this particular thing I found over 100 articles there're not it took me time you have to search with different kind of queries and then you don't have to just go into every article and reply right away you just make a plan to make three replies a day or one or two just to not be blocked or banned by by the Reddit engine itself because it has some rules for URLs too besides the subreddits so that's number one thing I do and that brings some traffic and then the number two thing I do is I put my directory into other directories and that's probably the second best way to start on marketing because uh directories are big and that's why the other directories might bring traffic to your directory but it has to be relevant so you have to find directories which are relevant but again you Google for them and usually find them and then the third thing I do is I go to social media and I start searching for the same question and then when I find the question there I reply with my directory there which works sometimes really well if if your directory actually helps to the original question I had that when fireship had this what was that he had this viral tweet about self Hoster software on Twitter and I replied with my hosted software directory and it was the most viewed and like reply there and since his post was like a million views mine got like 30 or 40K views it was really good and and the interesting thing that many people don't know is that Google they don't say so but they do this I I know for sure they look at backlinks from social media and if there is a good tweet with a lot of views and there is your link there it's so valuable and in that particular case it was like fifth or or 50th time I proved that so right after that tweet was going viral with my link there the next day I had traffic from Google growing for everything I have for all the blogs for all the items so this is way better backlink than a backlink from websites actually now these days so that's the third thing I do social media and I spend some time every day uh on that like probably every morning there are tools for that to spy for keywords but I rather do it myself because search is pretty good on Twitter and it's it's same kind of experience but more native and then the fourth thing I do is the SEO and that's probably the most important part and I do it after the first four steps because first four steps help me to validate my idea because if I posted somewhere and no clicks it means that it doesn't click with people right so people sew it but they don't click it it means it's a bad idea or the domain name is bad I have to change something there's no reason to push it further but if I have some traffic and it looks fine then I go for SEO because that's that's the key way of growing the directories and I will show you what I do with SEO so I have built a tool for that too but there are a lot of ways of doing SEO and I will walk through all of them but start with with the way I do it myself yeah so I go here and so I put my directory here and basically what it does is that it scrapes my directory it it it will now try to understand everything that's written on it it will try to do some research so it will basically do all the actions I do usually myself and that's how we build this agent so I just took all the actions I do and I program them into the agent and in a minute it will come up with some ideas on what what what can I do with the with SEO for this uh directory and while it's doing it there are other ways of doing it so one way of doing it is to use clothing or chity and generate content there but I would rather recommend using tools for that because SEO is more than just a Content it's a lot about in internal linking it's a lot about uh the structure the keyword research and all those things so in this case it figured out the content of my page and then it found uh the keywords and it came up with uh with ideas so these are pretty good like 10 locost business ideas for 2025 uh and it evaluates the possible traffic it can get for that based on the keywords and I can just go further and here I have the done for 10 articles so don't start with alarm articles some people just go crazy and you know publish hundreds of them if your site is fresh and the domain rating is low if you publish a lot of Articles Google will just never coll them because it will look like spam for Google that's why the first month you should have maximum 50 pages or 50 articles on on your website and then second month you can do more so I usually go for 10 artic on the first month all right I will approve this one so now it's working on this article so it's um it's looking for the keywords evaluating their traffic the complexity and then know working on a outline so it does pretty good job and one way to learn SEO is to watch what saay or bot does and repeat it manually if if someone wants to do it with their own hands because it does it pretty well it does pretty well with all the steps and all the actions yeah so now we will create the Articles and will publish them back to my website and quick ad break let me tell you about a business I invested in it's called boring marketing.com so a few years ago I met this group of people that were some of the best SEO experts in the world they were behind getting some of the biggest companies found on Google and the secret sauce is they've got a set of technology and AI that could help you outrank your competition so for my own businesses I wanted that I didn't want to have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I didn't want to depend on ads to drive customers to my businesses I wanted to rank high in Google that's why I like SEO and that's why I use boring marketing.com and that's why I invested in it they're so confident in their approach that they offer a 30-day spring with 100% money back guarantee who does that nowadays so check it out highly recommend boring marketing.com and that's it so from that moment I quit working on this directory completely so it all takes me usually first day to build and promote it on Reddit and social media and then the other day for SEO and more promotion and then I just stopped doing anything with that and I go for the next directory or I go for other idea and then I come back in 30 days and I look at the traffic and I see whether there is traffic or no traffic and sometimes there is no traffic and the thing is that if there's no traffic from my experience if there's no traffic it's really hard to fix that so I I never managed to make a directory have no traffic in the month and then do something so that it actually gets the traffic it's very difficult because if there's no traffic then something is wrong fundamentally maybe the domain name is wrong maybe uh the keyword look easy but in fact it is not that's why my recommendation is to never fall in love with the idea for a directory but rather make maybe five bats and then in 30 days look at the one that does the best and then put more time into that otherwise you'll be trying to you know push the dying horse and will just never work and in thir days uh I find the directory that does the best among all I did and then I do the next phase and the next phase is the data and that part is even more important because at the beginning you just selling the idea and people click that just to validate that they really care they have the pain but you don't Focus that much yet on whether your directory is actually good because if you focus on everything at once it's is difficult to be good at anything right so that's where the first 30 days I focus only on validation of potential SEO traffic and the interest from people but after a month I go full into the data and a lot of people who build directories fail here like must fail here because they don't put enough effort into making the data great and here's what happens if somebody opens your directory and they know the topic they understand it they are probably experts they can quickly see whether your data is high quality whe whether you understand the topic yourself and you're not someone who just used chity to come up with the items right and if that expert who sees your direct sees that the value of the content is high the quality is high they really respect that and they they really want to share with their With Their audience and that happened with all my good directories so they all have this moment where an influencer or few shareed With Their audience because they think it's really good and they will never think it's good if it's actually not good because they understand the data really well if they come to uh let's say I made this directory it was um llm models and then first I had I just hired a guy to fill it out with data and then I open it and I see that it's missing mistell there's no mistal there and this this is the example where if an expert comes in and they see you don't have mistell in your directory they will quickly realize that you don't know the topic you would never miss the most important open source project back at the time right and so if if the data is great uh the influencers might share it with their audience and from there your job pretty much ends because now it just turns into the organic system that people share if somebody shared then other people also want to share it like people work in a collective mind right and the only thing you have to do from there is to make sure the data is great you keep running your SEO activities like I run the agent and others can do other things but then the key focus is making sure that you check the data you check the space every week or month and you make sure that if there is really hot item appearing like new item that everybody talks about on Twitter you have to add it there you have to add into to your directory and you have to do it fast because if you do it fast there's a chance you will actually get the traffic from Google from people who search for that new hot item right on your directory and that's why say there there's very little work to do but you have to have put attention into the space almost every day so I have a lot of directories I don't really do stuff but I scroll Twitter every day and once I see that oh this item is relevant for this directory I just bring it in and that's kind of the next way the next wave of growth comes from being early to list hot items on your directory and Google will find nothing else on internet to supply to the user who is searching for that and Google will will show your item your page for that yeah okay so that's that's the whole path well it's the whole path so what you've just first of all that's thank you for for going through that but what you've just explained is how to come up with an idea for a directory how to create content for the directory how to build the website for the directory how to uh how to grow the directory and how to iterate with the directory one of my questions is great now I'm getting 50,000 unique visitors a month on this directory how are people monetizing directories uh and what what have you learned around the best ways to monetize directories if there is a best way yeah yeah so there are multiple ways depending on your audience so if your directory is B2B it's easier to monetize it because obviously uh you can go to businesses who have the same audience as your directory and you can pitch them in the banner spot or the sponsor options that's what I always did I had directories of all gpts and I just sent an email to all GPT owners saying that do you guys want to be featured on top of this directory because we have 30k items you just one of 30k do you want to be the number one on the top and then a lot of people said yes so that's one way the other way is the affiliate links and that way works pretty good if the items you have on your directory cost a lot so if you have items costing $10 then you'll make a little money on that because you need a lot of clicks but if you have items for 500 or few k then there is good money to be made there for example I have a directory for next GS boiler plates and I have affiliate links to all the boiler plates and they all cost quite a lot and it brings quite a good money good income so I would not exclude one way or the other I would say do the first one do the second one like do the sponsoring do the affiliate links and then the third option is uh is to sell the data be careful to not sell the data as a is because obviously you can't sell people private data but you can sell the the anonymized data or you can sell the insights and that's possibly bringing good income if you find somebody who needs that and usually you have to sell it to the corporates and you have to pitch that to the bigger companies where they are interested in in in the percentage in the distributions and things like that and the the most obvious way to monetize directory is to have a pay wall to list for example in this case um it's probably harder for business ideas because why would someone pay to list their business idea but for example if you're making list of n n like search for nanes and then every Nanny would pay quite good amount to be listed there if you have traffic and if you have the buyers and the same the buyers so that's number four payable for listings charge 500 or $50 for listings and then the number five is charge for Access for those who are most interested in the case of directory of nannies if you are interested in hiring a nanny you would probably pay good amount to get access to the whole database so you show top five or you show nanis without their contact data without their photos and then to unlock that contact data you have to pay and then you get access to the whole directory either you you get access for life or you get access for a month and then you can charge them for for that every month and the sixth is you find uh the brand sponsors that's what I do now uh so once your directories are pretty big you can find big companies big corporates who don't need the traffic who just need the brand promotion like we have Dev hun for example and it's really big it's the biggest after produ hunt and and now it's very easy to get big Brands like Clerk or like super base and others to want to be there to be affiliated with it because that's where developers hang out and they're willing to pay just to be affiliated with the product like so that you write like it's sponsored by super base and it's not for the clicks it's it's for their brand there and they're willing to pay for that every month or every week so we have very good deals now with with a lot of the players like that for ongoing sponsorship and and that's the best one because a it's ongoing usually they will pay forever because your traffic just keeps growing it just gets better for them and and also it doesn't destroy your directory because the Banners are slightly annoying for users because they will be shown and you want people to click on them so you will you will make them different color and that annoys some people but the sponsor links are usually smaller and they don't annoy people that much so those are the six ways and then the last way is or there two more but they are available for those who have other projects so if you have SAS project like I do and the main reason I started with directories was that I realized one really interesting thing it is much harder to win SEO traffic for a SAS tool than for a directory so instead of trying to win SE traffic directly for my SAS tool which has some random brand name that has nothing to do with the keyword that's why it's hard and I rather make director following the SEO driven approach I win traffic on directories and they channel the traffic from directories into the SAS tools and that turned out to be the best idea I ever had in marketing because now almost all my traffic goes not to my products but to directories and then to the products and also directories are competing for the keywords that nobody want to pay for for SAS you compete with VCB companies who are paying a lot for the keywords but nobody wants to pay for directory keywords because there's no money there and there no VCB directory that that wants to compete with you so that's the good way to monetize directory indirectly basically it's your free traffic which you would otherwise pay for and and the the last one is you can sell directories and you can sell them exactly to the people who have SAS tools who have the same audience as your directory and they would buy it just to channel the traffic and I did that I sold all I sold all gbts do go to cheap. a and they bought it because it has exactly the same audience and and it was really useful for them I think there's probably the best Airy on the market right now for marketing for a SAS company is to buy a directory and channeled the traffic it is way better than newsletter ads or all other ways because directors are pretty cheap if you look at their traffic let's say there's a directory with 100K views a month and you can buy it and in a year you get a million views and in that million views you can Channel at least 3% so it's like 30k 30k clicks a year and you will pay for the directory maybe 20K and if you pay 20K so it's less than a dollar per click less than a dollar what are the multiples for directories approximately like what are people paying for a directory there's no system at all it just depends on the audience because you you can't have multiples based on Revenue because re revenue is usually not that important the traffic itself also like some traffic is more expensive than the others I think from what I seen the actual Deals they go from 2K they start at 2K so you can find and buy a director for 2K which is which has traffic so it will definitely pay the the investment back and then the average directories go for 20K in average so small ones go for 2 to 5K and then 15 to 20K the average ones and then the bigger ones go to 100K and I think that's where it stops I never seen a directory being sold for over 100k and where where are people finding like if you if someone wants to go and buy a directory do is there a Marketplace that people can go to or um is this like reaching out to to Founders who who are selling directories well I just bought the domain called sell directories.com yesterday so I will launch the the marketplace that's hilarious right now I see them mostly on small marketplaces like not the ac.com because aire.com doesn't let directors in because they don't have revenue and they require their revenue but then there are these smaller marketplaces for smaller rep sites and I see directories there often for example one I seen the directories the most on called Micron iio I think it's a small one and they had like 10 directories under 10k there some sold some still being sold so but I think the best way to actually buy director is to go to similar web and research the traffic research the audience research the countries and then reach out to them and offer to buy I I do that and because if somebody put their directory for sale very often they want to sell it for quite a lot but if you surprise a Founder with a offer for a directory they might just sell it right away for the offer you made and you can have a better deal I think that's what I do right now last question and I know you don't brag or really share mrr that that much but as much as you're willing to share if someone you know what I like about directories is you can do it yourself or even a like micro or tiny team um what sort of scale could some of these businesses get to how big could some of these directories get to if someone to start one of these I think the the 5K is is probably where you can get without being lucky or being too smart like in in my case I would say the average directory I have is there it's on 5K uh and I know that if I put more time I can bring it to maybe 15 to 20K I think 20K is probably the limit for the the right now on the market unless you want to go fulltime into that and that's your main project but I don't see director as main projects so I only see them as side projects and I think as a side project where you have either I have my main projects but other people have main jobs for for that kind of case I think people can expect 5K Mr on that and then uh eventually get to the 10K but I wouldn't hope for a lot more than that so I would look at directories as a as a way to fund your life if you don't live in us because that's good money outside of us or I think directories are really good way to start building soft not software but digital products because starting with SAS is is the is the worst idea because you will fail Almost 100% And then you'll probably feel bad about that and never start again and go back to a job but with directories it's really hard to fail I don't think anyone can fail if they launch enough directories and if they spend you know six months on on those directories because in SAS failure means that you don't have growing revenues but in directories if you get to stable 5K visits a month for a B2B directory you will sell four or five ads and you will make three 4K a month on that and and that it will stay that way and even if you do nothing it will just grow because you have SEO as your channel and SEO tends to grow even if you do nothing if it's a directory because directories are in non-competitive keywords so that's why my recommendation start with a directory as your first attempt to build interet business and you will have more fun because you will get the doamin faster so B traffic and maybe the first sponsor all those things it will get faster compared to SAS and then you decide either you go full I see I I know people who go with directories uh full in for example starter story is a directory too right it's a directory of starter stories and he's making our a million and uh prod hunt was the directory of ideas first there was no voting system at all it was just a list of products he would just look around the internet and put in and send into newsletter every day right so there's a way to grow into millions but also the risk of failing completely is pretty low too yep well I think that's a beautiful place to end um John where where could people find find out more about you and get to know you better on the internet Twitter is the best place is John Rush X or my website John rush. me and I have this directory guide I I launched where where I walk through all these steps of Ting building growing selling monetizing so that's probably something people should look it into if they want to learn the directory World beautiful beautiful well man this has been a this has been a gift you gave people a gift I think directories are criminally underrated and uh I appreciate you coming back on uh the show if people liked it you gotta like it on YouTube I guess right and you gotta you know comment and and and build John up you know he came he shared some Secrets uh let's get this let's let's you know spread the love and and uh And subscribe and I'll and I'll see you all on the next pod yeah thanks for having me later John thanks for coming on you're the man appreciate you [Music]

1) Finding Chrome extension ideas:
• GitHub issue mining
• Chrome Web Store analysis
• Product Hunt research
• Reddit pain point tracking
• API changelog monitoring
Pro tip: Look for popular extensions you can "AI-ify" 

2) Why Chrome extensions are a great starting point:
• Perfect for MVPs
• Can evolve into full SaaS products
• Doesn't require large teams
• Huge developer tools market (Superbase raised $80M Series C!)

3) Building a Chrome extension with AI:
Micky walked us through creating a HTML/CSS scraper extension using Claude AI. Key steps:
• Prompt AI for code structure
• Create necessary files (manifest.json, popup.html, etc.)
• Load extension in developer mode
• Iteratively improve with AI prompts

4) Lessons learned:
• Some sites (like YouTube) block scraping due to security policies
• Images may not always render if hosted on separate CDNs
• AI can help optimize code and implement best practices

5) Publishing to Chrome Web Store:

• Create compelling icons
• Write a strong description
• Pay $5 registration fee
• Submit for review
Low barrier to entry = huge opportunity for aspiring founders!

6)  Key takeaway:
START BUILDING! 
•  Make it your mission to become a Chrome extension factory. Create one every few weeks, even with a full-time job.
•  The ROI from building to potentially monetizing is incredibly high for extensions.

7) Next steps:
• Pick an idea from the list in point #1
• Use AI tools like Claude or ChatGPT to help code
• Test and iterate
• Publish to Chrome Web Store
• Repeat and build your skills!

this episode is going to make you want to start a Chrome extension that does $10,000 to $100,000 a month of Revenue we went through a framework for how to come up with Chrome extension ideas and how to use AI to actually build these ideas I know you're thinking it's a lot of work to go and create a Chrome extension actually less work than you think and we show you exactly how to do it enjoy this episode [Music] we got my man Mickey back he was on the show video got hundreds of thousands of views I think or at least 100 thousand views um where you talked about curser AI for beginners so welcome back well again thank you for having me the the reception was great I I again truly appreciate the opportunity and I didn't even know we hit 100K that's amazing yeah oh yeah um but but this video is going to get a million views and the reason why this video is going to get a million views is because we're going to talk about how to come up with ideas for Chrome extensions and how to actually build your very own Chrome extension um that you could you know put out there in the Chrome App Store you know eventually charge money for it um or don't you know or just build something that you think is really cool that you want hundreds of thousands T and millions of people to use the Chrome the Chrome Store is a huge opportunity in so many ways um and I don't think there's enough Founders kind of experimenting in that zone so um I wanted to start off this call let's get right into it I I was brainstorming I was like hey what are some ways to come up with ideas for Chrome extensions so and I wanted to get your feedback on this so one is you can do GitHub issue mining on unresolved problems so um not many people know this but you can actually go into GitHub I mean the developers know this but non-developers don't know that you can actually go into GitHub and just kind of look at different issues that different projects have um and when you see like unresolved problems you can be like okay I can go build a Chrome extension there or I can build a SAS business there too but you know starting off with a Chrome extension I find sometimes a Chrome extension is a a great MVP minimal viable product and then you can always take your Chrome extension and then go build a SAS business out of that um a great example of that is vid IQ vid IQ was a a Chrome extension for YouTube creators one of the most popular I think hundreds of thousands if not millions of creators use it and then they pivoted not pivoted they evolved into a full-on SAS business so what do you think of number one yeah no I you know I I agree with you in a sense where I think a Chrome extension is a great um MVP to start with and there are a lot of GitHub issues uh like a lot of projects um especially open source projects there's a lot of issues that you know if you kind of see a repetitive thing like that could in it of itself be an opportunity I'll give you an example there's a library called uh tanack query um and I'm not too sure what their monetization process looks like but they solved one of the biggest issues in react land which was Data fetching um and there was a way that everybody did data fetching before they came around and it always caused issues but they saw that problem they solved it it's so good that even react and the docs recommend you use their package it's not built-in react but they tell you to use there so I definitely think it's a a great like place to Source um information see what problems um uh developers are struggling with and I think the developer Market is huge I I don't know if you know this but super base I think raised the series C $80 million solving developer problems does pay totally agreed um I actually didn't know about Tu base raising that much so I mean I think people are people are seeing the value in developer tools it's also great because it doesn't require you to have really big teams you can actually just create something and just let you know people use it so that's another reason why I like developer tools the second the second way is this is just sounds like like so basic but there's like a moment in time right now to do this is just go into the Google Chrome Store Chrome app store Google Chrome Store um and you can just go and you know look at the different extensions and you can kind of just you know scroll through it and of course there's now a lot of AI uh AI apps but you can actually go through and say like um okay in well-being let's say how do I take some of the most popular apps I usually like to go by highest rated and like make it ai ai ified so it's just a fun you know and of course like some of them aren't going to make sense um and and you want to focus ones that are kind of bigger um but thinking about how can I add AI to one of these top top apps is just a way to come up with ideas that makes sense AI I might actually do that myself I had a feeling you might I think I had a feeling you you you like that one uh especially because with AI reverse engineering like an already existing Chrome extension is not going to be hard um and adding AI to it especially with all the documentations like I'm speaking as a developer so yes it's it's easier for me but even as a non-developer if you have enough Grit to go through it it's it's 100% possible and and we're going to see how easy it is to build a Chrome extension with the AI sh don't tell anyone but I've got 30 plus startup ideas that could make you millions and I'm giving them away for free these aren't just random guesses they're validated Concepts from entrepreneurs whove built 100 million dollar plus businesses I've compiled them into one simple database compiled from hundreds of conversations I've had on my podcast but the main thing is most of these ideas don't need a single investor some cost nothing to start I'm pretty much handing you a cheat sheet the idea bank is your startup shortcut just click below to get access your next cash flowing business is waiting for you yeah exactly uh product hunt uh sometimes what you know I like doing is go on a product hunt search Chrome extension and you could see all you know popular products you know you can hear you can go into a category actually right here um well here it's just a list of Chrome extensions sorted with reviews and you can go into them and learn about what people like about it what people don't like about it it um so this is something I like doing is just going through product hunt seeing uh you know what people think about certain um Chrome extensions and you'll learn a lot and it's just like there's like infinite here there's literally infinite here um the other idea what you can do with product Hunt is you know look at SAS products and basically say here's a cool SAS product product how can I make a Chrome extension out of this ass product again these are just prompts to come up so that it helps you come up with ideas um hundreds if not thousands of ideas um we've talked a lot about Reddit on on this show on the startup ideas podcast um one of the things I like to do is to track uh pain points so you can set a IFTTT if this than that alert which is a service uh many people know about it um but basically you set up an alert for I wish Chrome could dot dot dot for Reddit you get a notification saying I wish Chrome could do XYZ boom startup idea yeah I did watch your one video where you go through and like people love to complain on Reddit so that is a great place to look they really do they really do this is genius you know we we talked a little bit about this but Chrome web store review analysis so you can just you can do kind of what we were doing with product hunt and you can kind of review what you know on the Chrome Store what people are saying about certain certain apps because there is ratings although I find that the ratings aren't as good as um product hunt because the people who go to product hunt are like tech people people so they're they're able to give like either you get a lot of like this is amazing good good post or it's like this is horrible for these reasons you actually care about the onear reviews you don't care about the festar reviews um and then you can use you know something like gbt if if you know if you end up wanting to create a Chrome extension Factory which I think some people on this video might end up wanting to do you can actually uh use tools like GPT to summarize the onar reviews fix the flaws I'm going to go through these very quickly and if people want comment if you want a separate video on on coming up with these ideas and going deeper on it I do you're like you're like I comment I comment right now before the video's out yeah that's funny I put this one in for you because again like thinking about developers API change log monitoring first to Market with new Integrations you know I I think that could be interesting YouTube tutorial common scraping what are people struggling with this is similar to uh Reddit paino tracking but if you look at tutorials specifically and like look at a tutorial like this for example and then you see what are people struggling with it and then go and solve it um we've talked about uh going down into into you know specific subreddits before I've created a video on this using tools like gummy search which actually brings out the pain points in different sub subreddits um and then you can also just at what uh feature requests are happening for SAS products you can use that you can use platforms like Twitter X to see like I wish figma did XYZ I wish this product did XYZ and then you go and build it with a Chrome extension that makes sense that makes sense especially the uh the Reddit one I'm I'm going to start doing that because all I hear people do on Reddit is complaint so that's actually a great place to find ideas so the first part of this episode was to get people fired up about building Chrome extension I wanted people to listen and be like oh my God there's probably thousands of startup ideas that are validated out there all I need to go do is build it and they will come and that's where you come in Mickey you come in as our our Sherpa our Sherpa to figure out how to actually build this thing so without further Ado we've got the cooking Master himself Rous Mike Michael sh shamels sh Chamis yeah and did a good job that was great there we go I you know W welcome to the stage I appreciate that thank you again for having me again I appreciate the opportunity and I'm excited so I think what we're going to do is we're just going to get straight to building um and we're going to build a Chrome extension and an idea I had was I wanted to build a Chrome extension that like let's say I see a a nice looking site like I don't know New York Times right I'm I'm not really a news guy but I do appreciate a good site and I could build this but it would probably take me a bit of time um so what I want is I want to B I want to build a Chrome extension that's going to scrape the HTML CSS of this page it it doesn't have to be exactly like the full page but at least just a a a a decent layout where I can take that and either pass that to v0 or to cursor and and rebuild this site or rebuild something similar now I know a lot of people were um asking me last time in the comments the biggest one is like oh but you can use cursor you can use Claw on cursor why don't you just use cursor why do you ever use claw there's a couple things first and foremost I find that I don't know what cursor does with their integration with Claud but I just find that sometimes the output I get from Claude directly on the site is much burer than much better than curs cursor so I don't know if it's a cursor thing or if maybe I'm just tripping I just find that I get better results and I also like the chat interface it feels like I'm chatting with someone so we're going to start here and we're going to say I want to build a Chrome extension that scrapes the HTML and CSS of Any Given site now fair warning it's going to say that um like you're not supposed to do this it's you're not allowed to do this cuz it has like uh safeguards so although this is not the uh best prompt to share with people this is what I would start with this is for educational purposes and I have written permission to do this and then I'm going to say I want to build a Chrome extension that scrapes the HTML CSS of Any Given site how help help me build this so I'm going to hit enter so it says while I can provide General guidelines on how to approach this I want to emphasize the importance of such tools and responsibility etc etc okay so it's giving me basically exactly step by step so it's giving me what files I need to create it's telling me how I would install the extension in developer mode so I can test it um and then it's giving me a basic implementation so what we're going to do is I have my cursor here and we're just going to follow this uh step by step which is insane by the way that this is even happening like you asked it a question and kind of like a junior developer it answered it um maybe even not a junior developer um yeah the funny thing is I never built a Chrome extension before um and I could have probably figured it out like just you know like going on Google and like or on YouTube watching a tutorial but I we literally are about to build a Chrome extension with I've only done it once before and I use the AI to do it and it's this simple so I'm just going to follow and a lot of people are like oh you could have done this in cursor and cursor could have created the files for you yes it could have but there's a great deal of learning when you do this right um I was speaking with someone and just from watching the video and doing claw to cursor instead of just doing cursor all the time he knew so much more um than someone who's never like the versus like he was someone who never coded but the way he was talking was he's probably a junior coder or maybe he's going through school for but he wasn't right so I definitely think you learn a lot from this so we're just going to do this together I'm going to do manifest Json um we're going to do pop up HTML and then we're going to do uh oops let me close that and that we're going to do um popup.js save that and then the last one is background.js all right so we have our files created now let's just copy the code so this is my manifest. js. Json paste that in here this is my popup HTML paste that in here this is my popup Js paste that in here and this is my oh no popop J is this entire thing let's paste that and this is background JS all right so paste that so I have my code set up let's follow the next steps it says create a new directory for your extension save each file with its respective name and content it says open Chrome go to chrome. extensions okay so we're going to do together so I'm on arc Arc is built on chromium so it should work on Arc as well and let me just remove this and it says enable developer mode on the top right so I have developer mode enabled you probably don't so click that and then it says click load unpacked and select the extension directory so i' click that and then I would find the folder which is YouTube tutorial right here so select that okay and this popped up and the way you can confirm the name is if you go to manifest Json I'll zoom in so people can see this is called HTML CSS scraper that's what this is called as well okay perfect so let's go here and let's test it I don't know if it's going to get it right the first time um but let's try anyway so I have a bunch of extensions give me one second is it this while you're while you're bringing that up I just want to say one quick thing that I think is really smart so you're using Arc browser and you have two screens kind of next to each other which just makes your workflow way quicker 100% I I could not live without this browser um just the way it has things set up and like I even have like if I show my actual browser like I have like different tabs like it's just like an organizational uh like Legend So 100% recommend and it just helps to have things side side by side um but let me get this extension going I think it's this one is that I don't have my classes it's this one right here okay so we have our extension live it's not the best looking it's right here so it says there's a button that scrape this page let's click it okay nothing happened fantastic so what we're going to do is I'm going to pop open on cursor right now and I'm going to say make its so that when I click let me look at what the button was again uh button is scrape this page when I click scrape this page that it actually scrapes the page and gives me the HTML and CSS that I can copy and I'm going to add at the codebase so it looks at the entire codebase to do this so let's hit enter this is how you know I use cursor a lot it says slow request I've already maxed on my request for the month that's what we want people to do that means that you're you're using it a lot no I'm I'm I'm Max using it Okay so we've got some changes let's just accept and let's save this and in order to reload the app I'm pretty sure all I have to do is click that it's reloaded let's go back here let's click on my extension okay so now if I click scrape this page I guess some HTML and some CSS which is great but let's make sure this actually works so we're going to go to a site called I think it's called Uh real time HTML all right so I wanted so that when I copy when I scrape this code right this page right here which we're going to do click scrape this page I copy this to click clipboard and if I paste it here it should work but it doesn't right and this is what I'm going to do I'm going to go back to Cur I know why it works um it it's not working because the way it's giving me the HTML CSS is not renderable but this is what I'm going to do the HTML and CSS does not render can you make it so that if I just paste the code that you give me it will run on any HT tml um editor slash renderer um I might have okay I'm going to cancel this the reason why I'm going to cancel this is I forgot to include add code base I'm going to hit enter again is it making sense so far Crystal Clear that's why I love having you on because you're you explain it so simply beautiful I I want to make sure that it's cuzz one I try is not I don't want to come off as a smart guy and like oh he's so smart but no one understands anything all right so I got some changes um I just hit save I don't even know if the changes are good but we'll just trust the AI let's fire the extension okay made some updates we scraped it I'm going to click copy to clipboard let's paste it here and okay so we see that it's giv me a sample meaning the way it's rendering the the way it's uh giving me the HTML is good now let's look at the output it gave me it says let's create a simple script JS file that will work with regular web environment these changes accomplish the following the HTML file now includes a basic styling okay to use Simple copy both all right so basically what it does is it created a version that's renderable I'm going to tell it this works but now I want you to scrape the website the extension is on and make it so that the HTML and CSS you get is renderable renderable like this example quick ad break let me tell you about a business I invested in it's called boring marketing.com so a few years ago I met this group of people that were some of the best SEO experts in the world they were behind getting some of the biggest companies found on Google and the secret sauce is they've got a set of technology and AI that could help you outrank your competition so for my own businesses I wanted that I didn't want to have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I didn't want to depend on ads to drive customers to my businesses I wanted to rank high in Google that's why I like SEO and that's why I use boring marketing.com and that's why I invested in it they're so confident in their approach that they offer a 30-day Sprint with 100% money back guarantee who does that nowadays so check it out highly recommend boring marketing.com and uh I'm I'm purposely taking the longer route because I can give it one prompt that will like make me like give me all the right like do the right thing that I need but that's coming from a developer mind I'm I'm trying to prompt it like someone who's not a developer just to show that it's not that hard just some things you have to push through so we're going to hit accept go back here oh I forgot to reload my extension we're going to reload the extension I'm going to hit this we're going to click scrape page let's copy to clipboard let's paste it here oh my goodness hello New York Times ah this is great I'll be honest I thought it was going to take a couple prompts yeah wow wow so I mean there you have it right it it just like a little back and forth a couple a bit of testing and like I noticed that there's this HTML up top so I'm just going to remove this right here and this is not bad it's not bad right like so again I mean the news is bad but the actual HTML CSS is beautiful 100% 100% I only use the New York Times cuz I don't even know why I don't even watch the news like that but again a couple prompts and and and this is why I'm I'm glad you started off with the Chrome extension idea I really think before people jump into web apps which is a whole different ball game again um it's it's it's not a like I'm not to scare people like you know it it'll be doable but it's not a simple game there's a lot you have to consider but with a Chrome extension the ROI from you building it to you potentially making some money off of it especially with the ideas you shared are just so much higher so if I were people if anyone's watching this I would build 10 of these like all the ideas that you had for a site I'm 99.9% sure can be a Chrome extension and again I I I honestly thought we'd get it maybe at the 10th or 15th prompt the fact that we got it this early is blowing my mind so I think you know you made a really good point which I think is make it almost like make it your mission to be a Chrome extension Factory you know even if you have a full-time job um you've seen you seen now firsthand how easy it is to create um so be that factory try to create maybe one every few weeks learn you know get a notebook and write down all the things that that you're learning um why not yeah and let's say you wanted to uh like push this to the Chrome Store right I've never done that I don't know how to do that so I'll just ask Claude I want to now push this to the Google Chrome Store how do I do it give me a step byep plan right and then all right ensure the code is complete thoroughly tested create a compelling icon 16 x 16 408x 48 128x 128 description and then look it tells you create a developer account sign in pay the onetime registration fee $5 zip all your extension files like so like again you can go from Chrome extension to this is on the Chrome Store pretty quickly I would say the only barrier of Entry is the $5 and that that's pretty low barrier of Entry so um I would I would honestly stay here especially for my non uh developers I would spend a lot of time just developing Chrome extensions and I wouldn't even do it right off cursor I would build it on claer you know chat gbt if you want to um and I would just copy the files over build that like knowledge base like where again as someone who's building Chrome extensions you know that you need a popup HTML you need a popup.js you need a script file you need a manifest Json and the more you do this the more you start to enter that developer mind and so when you make that shift to web apps which again are not simple it will be a lot easier from you watch the first video we did to jumping into web apps that have ai payments a database integration authorization authentication it's a whole different ball game but I think this middle step is so necessary especially for those who have great ideas like the ones you shared or get the great ideas that you shared so someone is listening to this and is and is probably thinking okay cool you built that but it's it's ugly 100% it is and simply what we're going to do is we're going to go to our cursor and be like uh let me open composer and I'll say this works great job but this is ugly let's make it cuter um and more fun wait before you before you okay I want to say one thing because I not only do I want it to make it cute and more fun I also wanted to implement best practices when it comes to Chrome extension design nice so we'll do this works um thank you now please review the code base and make sure I'm following best practices so we'll do the best practices first and then we'll make it nice and cute but for all the maybe people who know like basic HTML if you notice like this is HTML so you can style these buttons however you want um all right so it's adding meta tag and okay so it changed up the popup JS it looks like it made this function more optimized okay this all looks good to me uh meta tag here and then added a permissions here so we're going to hit accept and then we're going to reload this and we're going to actually why don't we do a more risky site cuz they have blockers and there's so much animation and I wouldn't be surprised if this came out ugly but let's let's take the risk here and I'm going to paste this okay yeah see because they have a lot of images this is going to come off weird let me see let me do what's another site that we could scrape um let's do YouTube so YouTube let's go uh where are my extensions at HTML CSS scraper scrape this page copy to clipboard let's go [Music] here okay wait hold on wait did I I scraped this page on accident give me one second let me go back to YouTube scrape this scrape this page copy and then clear this and then paste why is it giving me a duplicate uh okay so we have a bug hold on so let me go on YouTube I'm on YouTube right now close this and then hit HTML CSS okay scrape this page I'm going to copy this or I'll just copy this code and then paste this here why is it doing that I don't know if you know what it's doing but it's basically scraping the editor itself right okay so let's actually this makes it even better okay we have a problem let me go back to New York Times let's see uh scrape this page if it does the same thing then I know what the issue is okay so New York Times works and then let's do maybe a different site x.com let's do x.com here copy and then paste uh scrape this page I'll just copy the code myself and then let's paste it here okay so this works beautifully let's do this with what was the site that broke YouTube and let's scrape this page interesting I think YouTube is blocking it let me see let me go the cursor and say why can't I scrape YouTube but I can scrape you uh Twitter and and uh New York Times so you're you're asking cursor to to tell you what's wrong with this basically yes so it's saying the reason you can't scrape some sites but YouTube likely has a Content security okay so that's why it wasn't working so I am getting blocked let's see if the changes it requested makes any difference this why I refresh let's go here hit that hit scrape copy the clipboard yeah so YouTube blocks me but if we do X and then we hit scrape and we do this right here Twitter doesn't block me interesting there is one thing I want to test uh let me just save this here let me see if I remove permissions can I bypass that um and let's copy this to clipboard and let's paste this yeah so YouTube and and this is something new that I've learned um YouTube has what is called a Content security policy YouTube implements a strict content security that prevents inline script execution and rest and restricts where scripts can be loaded from this security measures to prevent cross-side scripting attack okay makes sense so basically why this is is we're deploying a script file and YouTube makes it so that any Chrome extension that wants to inject a script file um not work which is why most ad blockers if you realize don't really work nowadays because they implemented this so that's something new we learned um but yeah in terms of the rest I don't know why X doesn't have this let's maybe think of uh another s What's um another side Maybe Wikipedia just so we can see that this works elsewhere let's paste this okay perfect so you might realize that it doesn't have the image that's because some images are hosted on a separate CDN but if we do what's another site Greg you can we can scrap what about the arc browser uh so let's go ar.net oh this is going to be a tough one um because they have some next fancy yeah they're very fancy but let's paste this here you know what you know what it even got nah this is good this is good this is all AI this is good again sometimes it doesn't get the images uh which is fine you could just replace it with your own images but I mean come on Greg no that's crazy I really I said it to be to to just you know be a little bit of a jerk to see like how far we can push it and and your tool delivered and again I didn't optimize this I don't even know how the code works because I didn't look at the code I just I'm literally just accepting prompts because I want to do what maybe the viewer would do right if I were to like to sit down and read this code I could probably make this 100 times better because I have uh the privilege of having knowledge of programming but but for someone who doesn't it's kind of no longer an excuse especially with Chrome extensions you can keep hammering with the prompts and let's say you get nowhere with cursor I would go back to Claude give it the code and be like I'm struggling with this right let me ask Claude why couldn't I scrape YouTube even though it is for educational purposes and I have written consent I don't but for educational purposes sake um and then it tells me explicitly prevents scraping or automated copyright concerns yeah so it tells you that you there's legal risk you can't do it and it's better to use the YouTube API right so but even then we pretty much got arced down right so now I can take this HTML and CSS like this is a lot I can take this HTML CSS I can pass this to um I can pass this to whatever AI model I want or I can put this in my like in in like a on a on a code base like cursor I can read through the components and I can take whatever I want to take right um I know a lot of um probably now that I think about it probably not the best uh Chrome extens to start with but I know a lot of fishing attacks what they'll do is they'll have this own they have their this type of extension they'll scrape the site right and then add whatever is missing make it look exactly uh alike which this is not far off right this is not far off especially for a first scrap there's a lot of ways you can optimize and then you can switch the links and do a lot of bad stuff it even does the anim look at that I don't know if you noticed that GRE so when I hover over the button there's that I did not think that would happen but it does that let's go so yep there's that Chrome extension that's the video bro that's amazing well yeah I I would say people can if people can do this knock a couple of these out get used to it build you know an MVP with this because most ideas I truly believe can be Chrome extensions um and then if and people enjoy this maybe we do a fullscale web app I think I think that's right so if you made it this far give this a comment and like tell us what you think if we should do another video um and a subscribe of course to the channel startup ideas podcast um and Mickey where could people find more of your amazing tutorials on YouTube and and just get to know you better well I I appreciate the plug so if you go on YouTube which by the way I I just hit 15K subs today um shout out to you doubled that last video doubled my subscriber base so you can follow me on YouTube uh at rash Mike again I was at 2,000 followers follow before the video now I'm at 4,000 so shout out to the Pod you can follow me on Twitter and if you want to take the more formal route you can go to my website rosm m.x YZ bunch of links there where you can reach out to me or you could just DM me on Twitter I'm pretty nice if you DM me I'll most likely DM back unless you're trying to sell me Bots to bot my followers then I won't respond but yeah again thank you so much G I really appreciate uh the opportunity as always and it's uh thank you so much for your time and thanks everyone for listening we can't can't wait to see the Chrome extensions that you build [Music]

Title: The blueprint for a $340k/mo premium dating app
Published: 2024-10-16 16:45:00 UTC
Description:
Join me as I chat with Anu Atluru, startup builder, angel investor, and writer, as we dive deep into how to build and scale premium dating apps, and Anu shares her thoughts on how to leverage status to position and growth hack your startup. 

Episode Timestamps: 
00:00 Intro
01:14  Startup Idea 1: Premium Dating App for Niche Markets
20:38 Startup Idea 2: AI Girlfriends/Boyfriends for Niche Demographics 
27:11 Startup Idea 3: "Riz-maxing" app
30:42 Startup Idea 4: Report cards for life
35:02  Pricing strategy shift
38:57  Content format discussion

1) The League 2.0: Dating app for modern status symbols 

- Original League app sold for $30M+ to Match Group

a) Charged up to $2,499/month (!) for premium memberships
b) New version could filter by:

- YC founders
- Follower counts
- Who follows you

Key insight: Status markers have evolved beyond just education/job

2) Why now for League 2.0? 
- Cheaper than ever to launch dating apps

a) More distribution channels to hack growth
b) People desperate for new ways to find partners
c) Premium/niche dating apps are HOT

Example: Lox Club for Jewish singles crushing it

3) Controversial idea alert: AI girlfriends/boyfriends for niche demographics 
- Huge financial opportunity (but ethically questionable)
- Google Trends shows massive spike in interest
- Could target specific ethnicities, religions, etc.

Opportunity for brave founders, but proceed with caution!

4) "Riz-maxing" app: Charisma coach in your pocket 
- AI listens to your convos & scores social skills
- Gives feedback on awkwardness, charisma, etc.
- People crave honest social feedback

Think: Looksmaxxing app, but for personality

5) Report cards for life: Huge untapped opportunity 
- We're conditioned to want feedback from school days
- Adults still crave knowing how they measure up
- Combine with personality tests, IQ tests, etc.

People LOVE data about themselves!

6) Pricing strategy shift: Death of monthly subscriptions? 
- One-time payments
- Lifetime subscriptions
- Annual plans
- Pay-what-you-want models

Monthly feels like a "situationship" - users want commitment or freedom!

7) Content creation pro tip: Iterate on format until you find your groove 
- Don't get stuck on what you "should" do
- Experiment with:

a) Live vs. async
b) Solo vs. group
c) Short-form vs. long-form
d) Audio vs. video

Find your emotional center & natural aptitude!

8) Challenge: Create more novel content formats! 
Ideas:
- Tech/culture Daily Show
- Startup Cribs (MTV-style home tours)
- Live, unscripted breakdowns
Push to extremes - avoid the crowded middle!

I just brainstormed with one of the smartest people I know about 20 plus dating app ideas it was a live brainstorm she had this Insight I opened up a Google doc all of a sudden one idea three ideas seven ideas this is a playbook for how to come up with 20 plus dating app ideas one of the most proven ways to make money on the internet think you'll enjoy this episode start [Music] lovely to have you here you are probably you're probably one of my favorite follows on Twitter because you're always putting out creative ideas so I had to have you for the startup podcast it was only right I appreciate the sentiment um it's always nice to hear positive things about Twitter and not like terrible things about Twitter um and obviously you're a great follow I mean these days you're doing a lot of interesting stuff won't like give away the hacks of what I've observed that you're doing um but yeah always like Curious what you're thinking about love your letter love when my tweets show up in your letter so a lot of a lot of crossover very cool so let's start with ideas okay let's start with ideas all right so I always have like a bunch of ideas so I kind of like paired down a few today that I think probably relate to things that people know that I think about as opposed to like the completely off-the-wall things and maybe that like anybody could really like take a crack at versus like things that would be hard to do so okay start with a fun one which is basically like you know the league the dating app I do was started like 10 plus years ago at this point so I mean I don't think everything has to be like super novel I kind of think that someone should just like make another the league okay for for people who don't know what the league is maybe explain what it is okay so the league is basically it's like a dating app and it I think it was started around 2012 or 2013 and the premise is like okay if you're a woman who's kind of like ambitious and you want to get a significant other who is similarly ambitious and also wants to be with a ambitious accomplished partner like where can you actually find that I think the kind of filter underlying the premise when it started was a bit around like okay if I go to an Ivy League school or have like a ivy league esque job like I want to meet people who are similarly you know pedigreed in a sense so that was like the original premise and obviously like whenever one of these networks gets bigger and bigger it gets a bit more diluted they start kind of like expanding the criteria and like this actually was pretty successful and then they ultimately actually sold a match group I think like a couple of years ago and they did some really Innovative stuff with pricing too which is kind of another tangent but they started like charging like hundreds of dollars which was kind of unknown for for dating apps and actually were successful with it so hundreds of dollars a month I think they tested that if I'm not mistaken like I don't want to misquote it so I should probably research it but I think that's one of the reason that match was particularly interested in them as well because they started doing really Innovative stuff with pricing and like it's a little bit like this is in a sense like you know people are price and sensitive for some of these types of products okay this is crazy so I just Googled how much does The League membership cost you'll pay anywhere from $99 a week to $24 999 that's $2,499 a month for membership of the league yep wow so you could buy a pelaton forever or you could get a you know a membership for a month to the leak that's crazy yeah I think uh one of the from what I remember one of the interesting things that the league did was they did connect with your LinkedIn yeah I think they like I don't really know what the interface was like I I actually never used it but I do think they were like instead of going for socials linking they were going for like LinkedIn and you know now they've obvious obviously expanded a bit more but I I don't know if that's like an important part of it to be honest but I think what's interesting if I were to think about a 2.0 now is like and you talk about the sum too or we all I think anybody who's spending time online is like what are the new status markers or like how has status markers evolved and so I don't think it's like as simple as like I had an IV League education anymore or I have this like job at this like consulting firm or Investment Bank I think that's kind of opened up a bit so you could do like interesting things with like honestly you could make probably like a dating app just for people who are YC Founders like you know YC would obviously never do that but like somebody who's in it could probably try to do it and like that's obviously like one like status filter in the tech startup Community now um obviously there's like Rya which I think is like a bit more General like celebrity or adjacent to celebrity I don't think it's like specific enough on what they're actually trying to filter for so I think like a lot of people could actually do this in a bunch of different like modern High status niches I guess so because I have you here and because I know you know a lot about status symbols and internet status symbols oh boy yeah it's coming this is coming can you list four five six seven 8 nine 10 status symbols that are more modern internet culture types data symbols and the reason I say this is because I think people can actually go and create the league for ins they could um well you can do like the hard organizational filters which is like okay I why see as an example you could go like bigger orgs or smaller orgs like I think like the Theo Fellowship would be too small probably because probably like only like 100 people or something in there I don't know but I think there's organizations like that so you could do it that way where you're looking for something that's already defined um or you could obviously do like platforms so you know you have some number of hundreds of thousands of followers on Twitter or you know you're you're trying to get to that on YouTube so I think you could also do like all right obvious status symbol these days is like what's your follower account like on Instagram or Tik Tok or YouTube or Twitter and you know it's like kind of funny I feel like these days people are like I have a combined 250,000 followers across all platforms so like I don't know there's some interesting ways to think about it that way I think those are probably like the ones that would be easiest to filter for but to be honest I think there's like you know a lot more things where you could be somewhat subjective about your criteria which is just like what influence level do you have or like what circles are you in like even like looking at the who else follows this person would be like such an interesting metric to figure out like how much clout they essentially have or how much status they essentially have even if they only have like 5K followers or 10K followers so I mean I'm not going to list like 10 or 20 that are strictly visible online but you kind of get the gist of like where you could actually parse it out and find those Lanes shh don't tell anyone but I've got 30 plus startup ideas that could make you millions and I'm giving them away for free these aren't just random guesses they're validated Concepts from entrepreneurs who built 100 million ion Dollar Plus businesses I've compiled them into one simple database compiled from hundreds of conversations I've had on my podcast but the main thing is most of these ideas don't need a single investor some cost nothing to start I'm pretty much handing you a cheat sheet the idea bank is your startup shortcut just click below to get access your next cash flowing business is waiting for you I want to try something new I've never done this on the show ever and I don't know why I want to you're making me want to do it right now okay but I am going to share my screen you have to tell me what you think your like top one or two status status symbols are that you're seeing these days too yeah we'll jam on that so what I want to do here is I want to create like a mini one pager for this idea so basically I I buy your Insight so your in what is the Insight um and by the way if you're listening to this on audio like check it out on video I'll try to on YouTube I'll try to explain it I'll try to say what I'm typing out so the Insight is basically the league was dope there was something that was working with the league they ended up selling uh for Millions I don't know if we know the 30ish 30 I think yeah yeah I'm pretty sure they didn't raise a lot of money yeah I don't think so I mean I know for sure they raised like a seed at the beginning and I'm sure they did like another round but um you know I'm sure they also got a bunch of equity in match when they sold their Insight at the time I think was go Niche Go [Music] premium and I really do think that LinkedIn connect was an interesting filter yeah ended up charging what did we say like 20 like hundreds a month up to a couple of thousand a month hundreds a month up to go $24.99 a month so completely Zapped the business model so this is really interesting so like if your match group and you have a competitor charging this amount of money per month you might want to acquire this because there whenever whenever you completely change the business model that um that's interesting to someone who does Acquisitions yeah I'm pretty sure they like started testing some version of this like on Tinder or you know whatever their other apps are like somewhat soon after this okay interesting yeah so then it's like okay so here's the idea I can't write here we go here's the idea so what other okay what is a list of status symbols that exists today in 2024 and Beyond YC you mentioned I think it's interesting um it's so one reason why I say that and why I think it's interesting it's like okay obviously with a lot of these products part of the game is like how can you actually like get people to be talking about it like you could argue that maybe if it's super high status luxury like you know Velvet Rope stuff you actually don't want a lot of people talking about it but I don't know I kind of think the name of the game these days is you kind of do want it to have some you know hanger appeal or whatnot so like I think the more specific you make it and the more like remarkable in the sense that people want to talk about it you make it like the more interesting your early traction will be I wouldn't necessarily say like in the long term just YC is an amazing like you know dating app but I think there's something something to thinking about like not just like okay this is a like dating app for pedigree people like that's like okay cool you know but it doesn't like quite have the same hook totally okay so I think there there there might be you know these are things that might work right like when you're creating an idea dock like the idea you know what you really want to say is just like I think these are hypotheses this might work it might not work this this is the Insight you know so I I do I do think that that's it's worth it's worth putting in there and it's like a TBD you know in the future we'll we'll go explore you had a really really really good Insight which is people who how did you describe it people who follow oh like yeah I think so there's like status where it's like I can wear the status myself or their status like who's in who am I in the room with right and so you're like looking at the people who I'm in the room with and implicitly thinking I have high status so online you know that'll be like who's follow who else is following me on Twitter if you know like you're following me on Twitter or Paul Graham's following me on Twitter or like Elon Musk is following me on Twitter it's like okay even if I only have like tens of thousands of followers maybe I actually am a high status or accomplished like upand cominging person that is worthy of being included in some pool yeah that would be and you maybe you can play like a make a game of that too you know it's like I only want to date people who you know Elon M follows or something like that yeah this is already sounding like super like super like game the system like I'm looking what is it like the trust fund 65 like blue eyes Finance honestly you probably make an app like for that if you actually wanted to um but at the same time I don't know there's like something between this being crazy and something like also to say that there is a lot of pragmatism in like some of these things that people are actually like subconsciously if not consciously caring about so yes I think that's right I think that's right um what other you know I'm married by the way so I don't know I've been I'm not on the dating scene either but like I don't know enough people are especially like if you're doing anything in Social or if you're online it's just like you can't avoid being kind of like slapped in the face with This and like loneliness and dating and how to meet people so I think it's interesting like it's like a giant social experiment so I mean minim amount of followers like that was supposed to be Rya in the beginning um whereas like you needed a certain amount of followers basically and you connected with your Instagram like what was what was Rya Rya was basically the league but for like more celebrity yeah esque like more la like Hollywood adjacent yeah I would say and obviously I feel like a lot of people have been trying to get onto it and maybe have succeeded or maybe have not succeeded um yeah Ian you could do levels you could do like you know 10K followers I feel like was a thing for a while and then it's like 100k followers and you know now it's probably like a million depending on how you slice it totally um why now why why should this business be created now well it's easier it's easier than ever to create software so it's basically cheap to launch a dating app whereas it used to cost a couple million bucks yeah cheap to launch like so many distribution channels you can try to hack to get users like although that's you know they talk about retention of those users but in general I think there's like a lot more ways to try to get people to use your products um and I think like you know like probably the top in the top five topics for people between like ages 18 and like 40 is like how to find a partner so I think people are like okay like all the Legacy like wave of dating apps that have been around for the last like 10 to 20 years are feeling like increasingly like desperate and inefficient so I think people are looking for new things I think like the we want to do it completely on like offline IRL thing is cool but I don't think like 100% practical I do think there's going to continue to be like you know an in at least doing both things like looking on apps or online and then also doing a lot of the IRL stuff yeah I think that's I think that's right I think that's right so here here's like here's this is what I start with by the way when I come up with an idea it's literally this what would you add to it or or change change up about it as a married man [Music] um have you seen this I'm in okay now I can locks Club I have not so locks Club is interesting it's basically Rya or the league but for Jewish people okay so more of a high-end um more of like a high-end version like a premium version and I believe they also launched uh recently one for Asians so they're basically owned by the same company parent that's cool yeah I think that's pretty smart yeah and is it like in person online both I think it's I think it's online but they I think they must do a lot of events yeah but I think just going premium like looking at basically going through so going back to our our document it's like what's the Insight here it's like go through match.com and I IAC which is a a huge multi-billion conglomerate yeah that owns a lot of in dating apps um ic's portfolio and just create premium versions of what you see on their website so if we pull up match.com portfolio match group okay you see did you see my screen yep it's like a through z literally A through Z Asian people meet baby boomer people meet black people meet Catholic people meet divorc people meet India meet Italian people meet J people meet etc etc you get the idea oh my god do you see this veggie people meet I don't know honestly that's probably like I don't know how I feel about the name like we can talk about names I think names are pretty important but I think it's actually a pretty good idea to be honest just go through this and just build premium versions of this charge like do the do the league pricing and and C so and just cash flow don't raise money yeah I think that's the big thing now too which is like a lot of the bigger ones they obviously like went the like raise a bunch of venture money route and so they're kind of like locked into that path for the most most part so you can like start again and obviously choose a path that is more sustainable and more profitable earlier on and then you like don't even really have to get that big to actually make it a good business for yourselfa still sell it to somebody later totally and the beauty about some of these businesses is they know how much they'll pay per user uh per per you know multiple Revenue so it's like when you're ready to sell this business it's not oh my God I got to go like run this crazy process it's like no you're doing 2 million air R they pay 8X whatever I'm making this up um and you just call them up you meet them in their office in New York you get an offer you you take it and you that's it yeah and there's like always buyers I feel like because the base for the existing products is going to continue to turn out they're going to become irrelevant but like this is a perennial thing and I don't think the online or digital version of it's going to go away so I don't even feel like it's like it's it's not super like seasonal or trendy in anyway it's just like I kind of feel like it's like a little bit like you know restaurants are cool for like 2 or three years and then they're like you kind of need a new one to try and like maybe this is a little bit longer than two to three years because like to build up the network and then have the network effects it's like valuable for longer but I do feel like it's probably not that much more than like five or 10 years you know so I Like It Cool this idea I think it's a good one to me like we have a thing on the show is it a is it a sip or a spit and uh sip means good and spit means not good and it's a huge it's it's a sip this is like it's validated it's worked um I think the timing is good um the other idea okay can I can I make this idea even crazier yeah of course you don't make you're people are going to hate this one but I it's an opportunity for someone to do okay you just go through like that list that we sh showed uh on on Match.com and instead of creating a dating app which is is a bit more complex you have to create liquidity right Network effects right and you you know you target locally first it's just a bit more complex in terms of the user profiles up I'm GNA I think the idea is you create uh don't give away all my thoughts but okay good it's basically like ai ai girlfriends and boyfriends but in those niches so oh boy okay yeah I know I know I had to say it I to say it's okay it'll probably happen if it's like I mean I don't know can't you just like use a generic app and make a character but I guess it's like I guess like wanting a therapist that like fits your you know preferences similarly yeah I think uh quick ad break let me tell you about a business I invested in it's called boring marketing.com so a few years ago I met this group of people that were some of the best SEO experts in the world they were behind getting some of the biggest companies found on Google and the secret sauce is they've got a set of technology and AI that could help you outrank your competition so for my own businesses I wanted that I didn't want to have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I didn't want to depend on ads to drive customers to my businesses I wanted to rank high in Google that's why I like SEO and that's why I use boring marketing.com and that's why I invested in it they're so confident in their approach that they offer a 30-day Sprint with 100% money back guarantee who does that nowadays so check it out highly recommend boring marketing.com let's just use locks Club as an example or or the Jewish Niche it's like if you're if if we believe that AI girlfriends and AI boyfriends are going to be a thing and we don't have to believe it like I can pull it up on Google Trends right now I believe that it is going to be an economic thing I'm not sure Me by that well I believe that people are going to use it and a lot of money is going to be made with it I don't know if it's going to be like a human Improvement right engine I I agree with you I agree and and that's why maybe you you know people listening like don't like don't work on it you know you don't have to I I wouldn't I would personally wouldn't want to work on this but I do I do think that there's a Hu huge financial opportunity yeah to go and make millions of dollars doing this do I want to do it absolutely not here's the Google Trends data for AI boyfriend and it's you know charts don't are not nicer than this what is this tool you're using Glimpse yeah I use Glimpse it's just it's like a layer on top of I'm not affiliated or anything like that it's just a layer on top of Google Trends that adds like a few more like related Trends or what are people talking about on different channels um it also just has these like topics related topics and it gets you in these like I'll just like click into you know oh what I know what character AI is but let's say I didn't I'd click into character Ai and then and then it would bring me in this rabbit hole and it just allows me to get really smart about a topic that uh I'm trying to learn about nice um and I'm always like surprised when I mean I'm not surprised but I don't think like my approach to ever making things is like look at the trends and the search and like you know like it's like that's super diligent which will definitely lead to outcomes but I think it's like it's kind of the opposite of getting inspiration from something you're observing or thinking or feeling or involved in and I think for better or worse I struggle to be inspired Enough by data that I find alone yeah well I think uh it's you know you have amazing insights like you go in the world you get these insights and I think a lot of people get these insights um wouldn't it be cool if there was a league 2.0 I'm sure a lot of people think about things like that whenever I come up with an Insight my next step is I I start writing it down like I showed on the one pager I just get all my ideas out as quick as possible and then I I you know I'll look in Trends I'll I'll look at Reddit I'll look at Social to validate my my what I what I'm trying to build here because uh the way I think about is I don't want to waste like a year of my life or of course or hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars uh building something and this this is really helpful so Point here AI boyfriend trending AI girlfriend I don't even need to to type it I know it's going to be um what are you suggesting are you suggesting it's going to be even more popular that's the tone of your I think it's gonna be as as popular all right fair enough I I actually think it might who knows let's check I think it's going to be I think it's going to be as popular what what's the discourse the discourse is that it's probably supposed to be more popular because there's this like commentary that there's a lot of men spending time on the internet um so I can't I actually don't have the paid Glimpse tool but I mean it looks pretty they're both spiking they're both spiking they're both similar they're both similar um myout out to shout out to I think it's Amanda Bradford who made the Le yes she is shout out to Mana she's awesome yeah yeah she is awesome so um point is AI girlfriends AI boyfriends for Italians Indians Jewish people huge opportunity we don't want to do it but someone could do it somebody could do it I'm sure they will'll do it yeah um and please don't shout me out when you do yeah me either um um okay so is that a wrap on the league 2.0 that's a wrap on that let's do one more idea that's it one more idea my God okay all right that was like 30 30 minute idea okay all right I'll run through a couple quickly okay so this is since we're on the AI topic this is like a really small idea okay so I don't think we need to dive into this one that much but do you know this app looks maxing that whole like looks maxing I that's not the name of the app I think it was like umax or something like that that happened for a while like covered you Max on the show okay so you definitely know it like I'm like there's probably a version you could do with AI That's like like RIS maxing or like Charisma maxing which is like the product would be that instead of like you taking a picture of yourself it would be like the AI is listening to conversations that you have which I know it's like we've been talking about that for like friend companionship apps and stuff like that but this is more like as if it was like looking at your text but it's actually listening to your conversation and then it'll like score you on all these different like dimensions of social competence basically and it'll like it'll say like are are you being awkward are like were you being charismatic like you reacted like this odd way and like I haven't figured out what are all the different metrics but basically like I feel like people want social feedback a lot but they don't always get the honest feedback and I wouldn't say this is a durable product to be honest but I do think it's like the type of product that could have a moment around this like you know Charisma or social skills awareness rating like Trifecta which I think does play well as far as like people sharing stuff like this and is would it be like something like a a pendant where you you wear it and it's listening or what are you thinking not I mean I think that's like a whole another it's not like this is not in my opinion serious enough to like Merit a hardware product that goes along with it I think it's more just like oh it's like an app maybe you can like make it background listen like for some certain conversations obviously like all privacy disclosures like that's not part of this ideation process but I think it's just like okay let's say I was even having an interview or something or I was like meeting somebody new for a date I could be like how did I perform on this date like which obviously the date is not going to tell you how you performed so I I'm a little like not sure if it's again the human Improvement scale I don't know how it would rate this idea but I do feel like it could work if you if you made it the right way so I think there are people who are interested in like experiments that they think could work for short periods of time so this would be one of those I mean maybe maybe it is helpful in the human Improvement because the alternative is nothing or the alternative is you know anonymous apps like that are very hurtful to people you know people put up you know these polls and they get sometimes really really stuff I think it's helpful like short term but I guess my comment is like I do think like social interaction is the thing that will long-term help you actually improve upon those things so it's not like you can just constantly be getting a report C card on every conversation you're having in the me like oh I'm going to like look in the mirror and get better at this thing so maybe it's like good for some social awareness I don't know if it's good for like actually putting that into action long term so yeah I do like the Insight around report cards for Riz basically that's the idea yeah um I think report cards for XYZ in general is like a huge opportunity um people people constantly want to know are they doing good are they doing bad you know we we spend the first 21 years of Our Lives if we go to university 18 years of Our Lives let's say going to school getting Rapport cards did you do good did you do bad and then yes we do have performance reviews at work and stuff like that but I think people love report cards I like to know how they're do people like report cards they like like astrology esque things they like personality test oriented things they kind of like IQ test oriented things I feel like there's probably like some like cool horizontal here that's like related to all these like it's somewhere between a game and like some tangible information yeah I like it and if you're let's say you had this Insight I know you don't go to like dat look at data and Trends but like where do you go from here from idea to actually taking it to the next level well it's probably not like I don't know my answer would be just make the thing which is not an answer that invol a lot of other like research and stuff like that or validation necessarily but I also don't think it would be that hard to make I mean obviously you need to have like some ability to like build the thing but I don't know I think that most of it is just like building the interface that you actually want people to see so like most of it is thinking through what we're talking about which is like what is a report card going to look like what are like the five or six or 10 dimensions on which I'm going to give feedback and then maybe it would be thinking about like what are the use cases so maybe you'd make it easier for someone to use this by saying oh this is for an interview this is for a date this is for like a party this is you know like give them use cases so they don't feel like this is not normal for them to use it for a particular situation and then I think you could easily then like give examples of someone using it for each of those use cases and what that report card looked like and then create a bunch of content on the basis of of all those use cases and obviously that requires a lot of iteration but then you know put it on Tik Tok put it on reals probably like however you can get it out there and if you can make these like compelling little vignettes basically I think that's probably how I would think about actually getting people to use it and then obviously you you probably want to make it a like low price one time paid app if you want to make some money off of it how low price what are you thinking top know like less than five bucks yeah I think by the way like under $5 apps and stuff like that like there's a huge I think so too it's like a game you know it's just like a game basically you have to like obviously you got to like hook people to want to use it at least for a couple times but totally yeah so that's it's not the type of thing that I generally would spend my time doing but I think there are a lot of people who are really good at this and like really enjoy doing this and would be better than me at doing this and like you said I think there's like a lot of versions of this that could be done before we end do you have a question for me do I have a question for you yeah yeah um well you tell me all the secretive stuff that you're working on right now that you don't want to tell tell anybody that you're working on why I mean that's that's the question I would ask you if we weren't recording the the podcast that's okay no that's I like that that's the perfect you know um I can answer I can answer here's how I'll answer it okay so we've been building audiences and communities in a bunch of different verticals and I practice what I preach you know I really really do I am trying to figure out how which tools can I build for these individual audiences that ideally I can get some SAS level multiple for some of these businesses and and and and just be in the work of people uh be in the daily lives of people um you know I don't love monthly recurring Revenue in the I have a whole thing on this by the way yeah I mean I mean I love multi recurring Revenue no for yourself but I don't love it like to to actually ask a user to do this exactly okay so so yeah expand on that tell tell me more I just I think this like I think the subscription fatigue thing is real like and I think that is Prim merely about monthly subscriptions I think that like I kind I think I made some tweet about this or whatever like I usually like say one sentence things about things that I'm like thinking a lot more about and then later we'll probably write something longer about or do something with but I said something like monthly subscriptions are like situation ships basically and like a lot of users that are signing up for monthly subscriptions are just like okay I want to try this thing I don't really know if I want to commit to it like either they're trying to kind of do a free trial and cancel it right away or they're like don't end up doing that and later they're like oh man I didn't mean to like actually be subscribed like it's just like really irritating I think for people and they're kind of in a limbo state so I do kind of feel like things are going to be pushing towards like either obviously free people love free but I think like one-time payments which I think you've talked about before like is like a very appealing option I think lifetime like subscriptions which basically is a onetime payment is like another way to Market that which is very appealing I think annual subscriptions are fine too like I would love to not even have a monthly option like if I were like selling something on a subscription basis I'd be like it's annual or nothing basically and I think a lot of people are going to start doing that more I think there's also this like pay what you want Trend that's been happening as well and I think it's like all from the root of the fact that monthly subscriptions are just like don't feel good to users anymore and you want people to like still be uncommitted entirely or committed entirely in some way and then obviously ideally you want them to feel like they got a lot more value than they actually paid so yeah I have this like any product that I'm pricing I would not be at all interested in doing a monthly subscription like if I could avoid it and I think that's a bit of like a an unfair Advantage is if you create a product and you just shift the business model you know people are doing subscription you're now pay what you want now there's certain businesses that of course there's monthly costs so it might not make sense for every business and that's fine but I I do think you know going back to prioritizing tools I'm kind of like what are tools that I can prioritize that I don't have to do monthly recurring because I think that they're more interesting to people so that's my is there an example of that it doesn't have to be a tool you're making but like what do you think would be a tool that would fit that business model pricing model I mean Ben Ben tosel from Ben's bites yeah he I just want to pull it up real quick so he has a AI tutorial learn AI basically community and and content course thing he could have easily charged I don't know 50 bucks a month but I'm pretty sure it's like one time payment um yeah it's $250 one time that sounds sass right it's not exactly software is it more like content or it's it's content it is content so it's not SAS yeah um I don't have a SAS one on top of my head but they do exist someone in the comment section throw some throw some some of those um but they they're out there and they're coming more and more every day yeah um selfishly I have like I want people to make a lot more interesting content like than just new podcasts like yours is at least like a new format but I feel like most people are just doing like let's try to recreate the all-in podcast or let's try to like so you've been doing a lot more live stuff or you were which is very cool I think live is actually still very underdone like in particular for growing channels like and then obviously you can start doing a lot more asynchronous content as well um but I want people like do more novel formats and that could either be like towards live and like much more unscripted which I think you're doing or it can be like more produced and like more High Fidelity to some extent which I don't think people are really touching because it requires a lot I don't know kind of like requires you to like put your heart on the sleeve a little bit more and like put your taste on the line like if you're doing something that's like more produced I feel like people feel more like they're trying and so like it feels like bad if people don't like it but like I really want somebody to do like The Daily Show but for like Tech SL culture you know like Tech meets cultur I me like the B real like spot on SNL that like they did I feel like that's like you could do a bajillion of those like if you created your own or I don't know just like I think there's like so many even like um like architectural digest like home tours you could totally take that and do it but but like where startup Founders live or like you know I don't know if investors or like Founders who are actually rich would want to like show you that they have money if they were willing to that would be cool but I just feel like there's so many different spins that like you could do with different parts of like the culture that are still very resonant and it doesn't just need to be like you know a group async podcast basically yes yeah so I think really smart growth tactic and insight which is live is pretty untapped um obviously it's tapped in some niches like gaming and stuff like that but there's whatever it is you're doing whatever it is you're working on think about exploring new novel formats live is is is really interesting um and there's kind there is like a way that you can like I was doing lives before I did a bunch of lives um where people would come on to my show and I'd be like tell me your business and let me like break it down for you and really fun and I'm G to I I I will do do that again um but my point is it it isn't easy to get started but once I started doing it like four or five times I I you know it got a lot easier so don't give up in the first time um one of the big things too which you kind of probably figured out is like I feel like people latch onto a format they think they should do and then that format probably does not fit their emotional Center or like their natural aptitude like whether it's video or audio or async or live or like short form or long form or group or individual like whatever the combinations are and like I think you need to iterate a lot more on that to find where your emotional like Center actually is yes and pro like presumably I think like live and unscripted and like a little more of that I think through observation ended up fitting you better than previous iterations of things you had been doing which you could do but I don't think probably was emotionally the right fit for you and I think people make like they don't spend enough time iterating on formats to find the thing that they're actually better at and can do more sustainably and then like I think people stay too much in the like middle of the bell curve which is like okay what are people generally doing and I think most of the time you should push to some extreme like okay everybody's doing group like aing okay I should do like live and like try to solo stream or do one on or like some interesting format or I should like go more produced higher Fidelity like less often like I think that's also good too like to try those things where like people haven't really done a lot yet couldn't agree more if you go back to old episodes of this podcast I'm in the first episode please don't because they you can see how unhappy I am you can see that I'm just trying to make it work and sometimes you have to do that yeah because because on the other side of it could be something amazing but you know the podcast it was called where it happens it was like highly produced which is like not my vibe at all yeah um you know I literally just pulled out like a Google doc and we just started like jamming like that to me was like that's fun to me um so I think asking yourself like what what would this look like if it were to be fun in terms of content creation is a really important question that people don't ask themselves enough yeah I agree I feel like for the most part should be fun you know we don't need to like go do a tear down of Paul Graham's like latest essay or whatever founder mode not that one you didn't know he put out another essay like yesterday or the day before yeah it's like when to I don't even know what it's called something like when to do what you love or something like that so yeah you know there's like some meme about it it's like the bell curve and it's like oh like do what you love on this end and do what you love on this end and in the middle it's like basically like figure out what works you know or something like that so totally I think that applies to this too you know it's not like an unheard Insight but I think it's probably like pretty consistent it's a great place to end uh thank you for spending time with us today where could people follow your thoughts on the internet they can follow me where you spend a lot of time on Twitter um and I write long form essays like on my blog or whatever you want to call it it's at working theories t h e o r Ys misspelled intentionally. comom um but I mean yeah just go to my Twitter you can like find my website and all my links and yeah my DMs are open we'll put the links in the YouTube description cool and uh thanks for having me on this was fun um I didn't get to the back half of my ideas doc so you know for another time but if anybody ends up doing like the leag 2.0 and derivatives thereof I'm sure we would be curious to know 100% um let's make that comment section on YouTube thriving thanks again for coming on and I'll see you later okay thanks for having me Greg

Title: Vercel's VP of Product on how to use v0 to build your own ideas (Step-by-Step Guide)
Published: 2024-10-15 17:02:21 UTC
Description:
In this episode, I am joined by Lee Robinson, VP of Product at Vercel, where we dive deep into the frameworks and strategies on how to best use v0. Lee shares his unique insights into how to use and set up v0 to make the experience of building on top of v0 as easy and seamless as possible. Learn how to use v0 like a pro!

Episode Timestamps: 
00:00 Intro
00:50  Overview of v0
03:12 Tips for using v0 effectively
13:29 Importance of web design knowledge
16:06 Building with ShadCNUI and Custom Components 
20:27  Integrating Backend Functionality with v0
26:23  Final Thoughts 

1) Start with screenshots 
- Speeds up the design process
- Helps V0 understand your vision
- Can use inspiration from sites like godly.website
Pro tip: Upload & paste images directly into V0 for better results

2) Iterate, iterate, iterate 
- Don't expect perfection on the first try
- Keep refining your prompts
- Example: "Make it have warmer grays", "Use a nice sans serif font"
Lee went through 12+ versions to get his Spotify-like UI just right

3) Leverage Tailwind CSS knowledge 
- V0 thinks in Tailwind
- Use specific Tailwind classes in your prompts
- Example: "Make it size-4" for precise control

4) Make it responsive 
- Simply ask: "Make the table mobile responsive"
- If issues arise, describe the problem: "I can't see the table of songs because the image is so large"
V0 can quickly adapt designs for different screen sizes

5) Break it into components 
- Ask V0 to refactor your code into reusable components
- Makes it easier to maintain and scale your project
- Example: "Let's break this out into components"

6) Use V0 to learn web design basics 
- Ask questions like: "I'm a novice at web design. What can I try to make things look better?"
- V0 can explain concepts like serif vs. sans-serif fonts

7) Implement backend logic 
- V0 can help with database schemas, ORMs, and API integration
- Ask for help with specific frameworks or languages
- Example: "Help me take this Postgres schema and give me the ORM for it"

8) Fine-tune animations and interactions 
- V0 can suggest ways to improve UX
- Example: "Can we make the sheet open up faster and make it have a better easing animation?"

9) Use V0 for inspiration 
- Start with a vague idea and let V0 suggest designs
- Example: "Build a page where I can post a link, hit a button, and it'll send it to Slack"

10) Embrace AI as an augmentation tool 
- Don't see it as a replacement, but as a knowledgeable partner
- Experiment with V0 and other AI tools to unlock your building potential
"You can build whatever you want. You have all of the power now with these tools." - Lee Robinson

super excited to have Lee here Lee is the VP product of versel everyone who listens to the startup ideas podcast you know what versel is you know a lot of the products that they come up with today I wanted to talk to him about uh really just how do you get the most out of vzer and uh he's been kind enough to be like yeah I'll tell you how to get the most out of vzer so thanks for coming on Le yeah thank you for having me I've been watching a few of the recent episodes and uh I'm in good company so let's to be fun absolutely you're you're one of us you're an IDE you're an idea person so hey ideas guys we're we're the future now right we're the new Builders finally [Music] finally cool so where do you want to start um maybe just set a little bit of context um for folks who are tuning in and maybe they've heard of Rell but they haven't heard of VZ let's quickly talk about that and then we can do a demo get into how to use it and all that other stuff so VZ is a product that we've been building at for sale you can kind of think about it like your AI assistant specifically for web development you know there's I think in the future there's going to be tons of hyp specific AI tools for everything that you need to do and the part that we're really focused on you know selfishly for our own needs we want to use it to build our own things is the web it's working with JavaScript it's working with HTML uh CSS all these new Frameworks all these new tools and libraries that the Frameworks integrate with we're trying to make it just as easy as possible to get high quality stuff out of that and ultimately high quality products because at the end of the day this is all just ones and zeros for the products we're trying to build and you know ultimately make money from so that's really what we're doing with vzer and um yeah I'd love to walk through some of the things I've built with it talk a little bit about how I think about getting the most out of it and and you know maybe pick up some tips and tricks along the way that sounds perfect yeah I've done some vzer videos but to be honest it's been just trying my best to get the most out of it um so it'll be really interesting to to hear it from you um because you just you know coming from for sell coming from bzero um you have a more intimate relationship with the product and and I I've learned that I I just interviewed omj the COO repet and him showing repet I was like that was really cool cuz I saw repet in a completely new way MH but I need to see vzero in a completely new way so thank let's uh yeah if you want to share your screen we can get into it yeah let me do that I'll share my I pulled up some vzer um chats that I have and I'll walk through a couple of them with varying degrees of uh UI completeness the first thing I will say is like you can of of course use vzer to make great uis but you can also do it to do backend work and you'll see as I kind of dig into this more I'm not just making it look nice I'm also starting to add interactivity so my first tip which is probably obvious but starting with screenshots is actually super helpful so I wanted to build something similar to Spotify but way more information dense just a nicer looking UI and some of this is you know your own opinion your own taste and what you think the thing should look like so I had an opinion going in there's kind of kind of two different creative modes to go in for me it's like one I have an opinion two I don't really know just let the AI paint things for me and then I'll kind of see what I'm working with just to kind of quickly pop over to this one I didn't really know what I wanted build a page where I can post a link hit a button and it'll send it to slack like I wanted to build this little thing that integrated with zapier I didn't really know what I wanted the U UI to look like I didn't really know what I wanted the code to look like I just said this is kind of a thing I want to do just build it and let me get back to what I was trying to do and it gave me this it was basically a oneshot it gave me this component I was like cool I took it um you know put it into my app put it into my code base and was kind of done with it um but going back to here I was more so I had an idea about this music player I wanted to kind of iterate on it so started with a screenshot and it tells me a little bit more about what it's doing the first version I'm on V12 here first version was not that great it was okay like it's got the shape of what I needed to do but it's not um it doesn't have the design sense that I wanted when I got to of course this V12 version that's quite a bit better um so if I scroll down here you can see some of the things that I actually asked it make it have warmer Grays use a Sanda font um and if you say from Google front from Google fonts with next font uh it knows exactly how to import that it might figure it out automatically but I just do that intentionally make the UI have a tighter information density so it's like okay I'll update some of these things I'll change some of the colors then I said oh the time playing bar should be longer the search input should have an actual input in it add more realistic fake data for the songs so now let's see we're already like decently closer to what I wanted like I'm looking at these rows and they're still not really as tight as I wanted this thing on the right is kind of confusing but it's okay so I keep going I say less vertical spacing between the rows each row should have the album art to the left of it um make the default value of the search input electric the playlist name should be aligned with playlist make the image it the album image Art smaller and you'll notice one tip here that I start doing is VZ thinks in Tailwind so if you've ever used Tailwind CSS before you can just tell it kind of explicitly the Tailwind class that you're looking for versus letting it you know try to figure out figure it out on its own so I said make it size four just make it that exact value um so now it's it's looking a little bit better and some of this I'm I'm getting its ideas on what it thinks the UI should look like and it wanted to put the artist name underneath the song name but I didn't really like that so I'm like let's put the artist names in a column versus Under the title um use this as a placeholder image for all of the albums use electronic music for all of the placeholder data so you can upload and paste in images and then it can use images or other files in the actual designs shh don't tell anyone but I've got 30 plus startup ideas that could would make you millions and I'm giving them away for free these aren't just random guesses they're validated Concepts from entrepreneurs who built hundred million plus businesses I've compil them into one simple database compiled from hundreds of conversations I've had on my podcast but the main thing is most of these ideas don't need a single investment some cost nothing to start I'm pretty much handing you a cheat sheet the idea bank is your startup shortcut just click below to get access your next cash flowing business is waiting for you so now like it once you start adding images you can really start making things look a lot better and you realize how much of web design is just topography and imagery so that's also huge huge piece of making it look nicer uh make the playing track a little less wide you notice I'm not I'm using just kind of normal language like talking to it how I would talk to my designer like hm that now playing bar is pretty wide like I would probably make that less don't make sure that the the lines don't break into two lines um make the width of the column smaller and then again this is where if you have some pre-existing web design CSS knowledge you can really steer the assistant in the right direction like I already know there's this CSS property called tabular nums which is going to make sure that all of the numbers are vertically aligned um so I said please use that um and that helps me get to something that I think is looking pretty good this one's fun make the table mobile responsive so I was here and I think what I was looking at was I went like this and of course not responsive so so I just said make it responsive and uh I think it did a pretty decent job of like something but it wasn't really great yet so I said I can't see the table of songs because the image is so large can you fix it and now now we're talking so now it's like something that's a little bit better you notice there's this air like I think it was struggling to import this scroll item thing but I can probably fix that later but now we're at a point where like it's mobile responsive it's a little bit better and I got this is pretty much all of here I ended up forking it which I can do in the top right and I started going a little bit further I said let's break this out into components and let's start trying to add some logic to it so I took it from here and I think I also said let's make the colors a bit darker I liked this version but I wanted to experiment and see what darker uh Grays would look like and I think I liked this a bit better so I just kept going kept going in here adjust the color scheme to be darker than the original but not full black uh and so on and so forth so I'll pause here in case you have questions on on this one so some people listening to this like some are Engineers who might not be great designers some are founders who maybe not be great designers and I've noticed that you have the touch around steering vzer in the right way like you have a a foundation it sounds like of saying the right words or understanding is this you know what's the difference between a sarant and a sanant my question to you is before you even touch vzer is it required to kind of learn a little bit about how web design works and if so like what what sort of advice do you give to folks yeah I think if you have pre-existing knowledge of some of these things you'll be able to fly faster but it is not a requirement and I think as with most like development learning categories sometimes you just don't know the right questions to ask and I think one thing that any of these AI assistants can be very powerful at is helping give you some questions to ask so you might ask vzer I am a novice at design I don't really know how to make my design look better but it's just lacking something like what do I have to do to make it look a little bit better and we could even just go in and I don't know let's see what it says like I'm uh I'm a novice at web design I don't know what I'm doing what can I try to make things look a little better any common practices or patterns PS and I'm really curious to see what it says and I can kind of gut check that with my understanding of web design which I'm not a designer but I have some opinions on The Taste we'll see what this says um consistent color scheme stick to two to three main colors yep that's one of the things that vzer is going to do by default is use Tailwind which inherently uses a design system it has a grid of colors that are going to allow you to kind of stick to some of those best practices uh and Implement white space padding in margins give the elements room to breathe sure readable fonts use sansera fonts for better readability so maybe I would say what is a sansera font and what are the differences I again get that cued as a followup some of the other things in here are what consistent um the layout is aligned and organized it's responsive includes images it's focused on essential information and some of that stuff's good what other things in here use high quality images I mean that's an obvious thing but it actually makes a huge difference um you realize just so much of the web if you go look at like Apple's websites the majority of it is really high quality photography so Sans serap fonts you have also sarap fonts and this is kind of a cool cool visualization of the different letters I like to think of the Sarah font as like reading an old timey book cool yeah so I think you know what you're saying is sometimes in order to go fast you need to go slow you know you you have to like you can ask some of these questions learn and then sort of go back and and just develop taste through the process of learning um you know it's Pro the reality is it's probably going to be better to learn I mean I do think that like it's helpful to you know follow interesting people on Twitter you know designers on Twitter and you know get a book here and there on this stuff but I think that you know prompting vzer as a as a way to learn especially while you're in the product seems Seems like it makes sense okay what's this yeah check out um godly. website I know there's a bunch of sites like this but it's basically design inspo so you can go in here and filter by startups and just get a bunch of really beautiful looking websites you know click in evervolt which is a super awesome website definitely check them out just got some cool stuff you can see other similar things I look through here all the time just to get inspiration and again because you can start with screenshots you can start with these not with the intention to copy any of these designs but to at least get some of the bones right like sometimes you don't even know how to get the right layout or the right elements like you don't know how to think in give me a three column grid that has two like that's not the language you're familiar with but you are familiar with I don't know let's go to like pricing pages is there a pricing page on here pricing no um let's see there's another one I use also patterns have you heard of that one oh yeah yeah that that's a great one like uh let's see like this one's pretty cool this might be a pattern that you want but you didn't really know how to put it into words and you might be able to build something like this like large section at the top and then a five column grid below it with scrollable areas that makes sense totally yeah um start up idea by the way someone needs to do Godly website but with like here's the here's like potential prompts that you can do for zero um I think that would be really really valuable yeah I mean one thing just to build off that um VZ is built on top of this system called Shad CN UI that allows you to build your own component library and the idea with VZ is you should be able to take the code that it generates and it's not throwaway code we're trying to give you real react components that use the same technology you would build for your production website anyway so you don't have to re architect the whole thing later and what Shad CN UI does is it gives you kind of some of these UI patterns like this is a real component for a mail app a dashboard app cards tasks uh AI model playground chat forms music player you can take this and basically Fork it and put it in vzer and get started building something from here and then when you want to make it look unique you can customize the you can change the colors the spacing and now you have something that kind of looks like your brand this is all the foundation in which vzer is built on and it speaks this same language so you can even say like give me a component for the um date picker for example and it's going to know about this this widget I like it maybe um another one that's interesting to show um VZ has the concept of projects so I have a project for a music player where I've asked some follow-up questions to it um another one that I started building was this kind of SAS landing page I'm trying to see which one was the first one I started with I think maybe it was this one I forked I started with the pricing page and then I ended up forking the colors and the font and the general Vibe for the landing page I was like let's make the homepage version of this keep the same navbar but we want to give it some this like SAS template so let's highlight some things let's make a CTA that says deploy your own um and I think I'll just see what we got on this first version this looked pretty basic so I said let's not use cards let's make it very minimal no white backgrounds we kind of want to go vertically and use maybe a list of it items so that's a little bit better I said I just said try a different style like I don't really like it just try something else and then it gave me this and I was like okay I think we're a little bit closer um instead of an image in the hero do an animated terminal with this sequence of events for the bottom CTA make it on the right hand side a CTA that's bigger set of images I'm like okay and now we have this terminal but it's kind of slow on the animation I'm like okay so use a mono font monospace that's another type of font that again if you're not sure you can just learn more about it um make it animate faster make a copy to a clipboard button um add another step in the terminal this is closer sometimes I talk to it like I'm talking to a pair programmer it's closer but uh for the middle section make it a white background and it needs to take up the full width uh and that's kind of where I landed here um which is pretty decent this is still the actual landing page that I used for this SAS template that I had and once I got here um I wanted to Fork this for other pages in my project and I ended up building the kind of logged in dashboard view I said let's make a general page where you can manage your subscription in a card and then update the user info like the name and email make the general tab have an active background State and it gives me something that looks like the basic crud create read update delete actions you would take in kind of an admin portal for your SAS app and the cool thing is not only is it giving me this UI for styling it I then went from here and asked it to actually Implement these things so this activity log I can't remember if I did it in here said uh let's make it look more like a settings page make the notifications page say Activity um which by the way make it more like a settings page if you don't like one thing I've learned is if you don't know if you or even if you forget what a settings page looks like go to your favorite apps check what their setting Pages look like and either screenshot the them or just tell vzero hey it doesn't feel normal right and like looking at the code for what it gave me here on the first one it it it kind of embedded this mock or fake data for the activity logs and the nice thing is then I put this into my app I can then basically Swap this out with an API call so I could either ask it I can give it an external API and it can fetch it for me inside of VZ or I can say here's the schema for my database I can add it as a source in my application or in my project so it knows about it give it some guidelines and it'll know exactly how to hook this up to real data uh as well and sometimes if I haven't got to that point yet I said hey help me take this postgress schema that I have and give me the OM for it so whether I'm using drizzle or Prisma if you're in the JavaScript typescript land or if you're in you know rails or laravel or like other languages you can ask questions about how to get the you know the relevant code based on your database structure you might not even know what the SQL code looks like you can just say I need a table for users and emails and the users and emails are probably related in some way and it can help you design the backend for your application as well yeah I feel like not enough people talk about that it's it's really underrated for me because this this is the next step after this right like you get this and you say okay now I need to actually make it an app so help me think through the back end of it help me think through how I structure my schema little things too like quick ad break let me tell you about a business I invested in it's called boring marketing.com so a few years ago I met this group of people that were some of the best SEO experts in the world they were behind getting some of the biggest companies found on Google and the secret sauce is they've got a set of technology and AI that could help you outrank your competition so for my own businesses I wanted that I didn't want to have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I didn't want to depend on ads to drive customers to my businesses I wanted to rank high in Google that's why I like SEO and that's why I use boring marketing.com and that's why I invested in it they're so confident in their approach that they offer a 30-day Sprint with 100% money back guarantee who does that nowadays so check it out highly recommend boring marketing.com help me design it in a way that it's really fast and it's probably going to suggest something like you might consider using indexes on your database so that for common actions it's going to be faster to query those things and it will give you the you know the proper om schema for your application that's going to have some of those things um let's see if there's other ones in here um here's here's another one that I worked on that could be interesting um again started with an image I said use a monospace font uh make it tight information density wise I guess that's a common pattern for me use neutral Grays um and I went through 22 different versions here so the first version was way different oh actually I remember now I started from an older version that I built which looked like apple mail and eventually after I got this back because I was like maybe I'll build Apple mail but it will be all monospace it's going to look like some kind of cool you know hacker email client and I was like nah like let's make it look like superhuman instead because superhuman is just a beautifully designed uh email app so I sent in a screenshot of that and the first version he gave back was actually super good I saw this and I was like holy this is very close to what I was wanting and I was basically from here I realized there was actually something here that I could build so this seeing this was what actually got me excited to make this into a real app so I asked a bunch of things here like make action items hover on selection um ended up you know going through a bunch of different variations here which we can walk through all of these if you want um things like can we make the sheet open up faster and make it have a better easing animation so if you don't know anything about animations again you could ask how why does this animation feel slow and it's going to tell you well the way it's doing this is through Tailwind animations so we can override it and give it we can make it a faster duration and we can use this uh cubic bezier easing function I would have never figured this out like I would have never went in here and customized my cubic bezier function but vzer knows how to do that which is nice totally yeah Le you're not you're not that type of guy no I am not I'm not the uh design expert but I like to think that I have an opinion and taste about what a good product looks like and in today's day and age with these tools like in a lot of ways that can be an extremely extremely value quality because I kind of know what I want to build and I just need somebody to help me get there and when I reflect back on when I learned how to program and I was furiously Googling and stack overflowing things like if I had tools like this that would help me build whatever I could think of man that would be wonderful so I'm just so excited for people who are building products right now it's never been a better time I think this is a good place to end but what's what's something you want to leave people with you know is there is there one thing that you know this is this is an audience of Builders right they've got ideas they're building they're playing with these tools uh they want to they want to produce the best possible prototypes and products they possibly can uh one thing you want to leave them with I think there's a lot of discourse right now around whether AI tools are helpful or harmful for the development ecosystem right because I think a lot of people see this as is this replacing work that I would be doing and maybe they're apprehensive of actually learning and using some of these tools and my kind of plea to everyone is just suspend disbelief a little bit and whether it's V zero or any other AI tool just give it a shot and see what it feels like because you might rethink your relationship with how you build applications and realize these are definitely not replacing anything that we're doing they're augmenting it in a way that is like I had that knowledgeable super senior engineer next to me that I could ask questions whenever I had issues and would help give me kind of some of these best practices along the way to build better products and once you get that mindset you realize right now more than any other time in history there's you can build whatever you want you have all of the power now with these tools you can say I want to build an IOS app and you know GPT or any of these other tools can help you build anything they knows everything about Swift it knows everything about cotlin and Android so um definitely give it a shot um give these new AI tools a shot and I think you might find it pretty interesting I love it Lee where could uh people get to know you better because I feel like you're underrated you are you were criminally underrated actually I'm gonna say that well thank you and yeah where could people find out more about you and and and and you know where where do people play with vzer totally uh vz. deev if you want to try this out there's a free tier uh for me ler.com I make YouTube videos I write sometimes I tweet a lot so go check out my Twitter if you want to see a stream of Consciousness and uh yeah that's me beautiful and if you're listening to this like and comment for Lee uh I'd love to have him back I feel like uh we've got a lot to learn so um let's uh let's give him a warm startup ideas podcast welcome and uh I'll see you around Lee yeah thanks for having me on of course Peace [Music]

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
the goal for any entrepreneur starting out is to make 100 to 200k a year after that everything is upside and gravy but that gives you the Launchpad with which to launch the good businesses the old way of creating startups was you know technical founder and maybe maybe a designer maybe a business guy now I think today you kind of need idea Galler guy and a funnel guy or gal whenever you see that that's like a l it's like a lottery ticket I almost don't want to air this episode I want to just I want to edit that out and I'm gonna build this in Canada right now [Music] start Andrew Wilkinson on the startup ideas pod and I'm doing this new thing Andrew where when I start the Pod I ask you know if you listen to the entire pod what are you going to get out of this pod man I hope there's someone like driving their car and they pull over and get excited about an idea or something I I love um like I like listening to the my first million episodes where people are brainstorming and like Steph Smith or someone will go on and she just drops some cool idea that's hits me uh so hopefully one of these ideas hits somebody and I've been doing this show I've done like 100 plus episodes and I will say the document you sent over with startup ideas is by far the most thorough document I have gotten back really I'm I'm shocked and appalled to hear that because I did it in like three or four minutes and and that's that's why I wanted to have you back on on the Pod um and let's get right into it yeah man awesome um so H how do you want to go about doing this we can go start to bottom top to bottom sure okay so um I've been deep diving on this because I have a big yard and I spend a lot of money on landscaping and I don't really know what they do and so I started digging in and I realized that I was spending like thousands of dollars a month on lawn care because I've got like I've got a big backyard and a big front yard you've been to my house it's it's quite um large but not necessarily complicated or anything and so I think just because it's big I'm like a sucker like the the the Landscaping guy comes to your house and if you have a big house and you have a gate he's like you know what I'm GNA give this guy the rich guy charge and so uh I realized that I can basically buy a robot lawn mower so for people that aren't familiar it's basically like a Roomba except it mows your lawn and so you just put this thing outside and you geofence your lawn and you kind of tell it what to do and every day or a couple days it'll go and mow and so um because you only mow your lawn like once a week or so um you can actually have one and it can do multiple yards and all that kind of stuff and so I just thought that was really interesting because the return on investment for this versus something like solar is crazy if you get solar panels you're looking at like a 10 to 20 year payback depending on where in the world you live and a robot mower can pay itself off in like six to 12 months pretty much which is pretty crazy um and if you think about it a Roomba kind of sucks because a house is a highly variable environment so I've had roombas for 20 years every couple years I get excited I go and buy one and over and over again I have the same experience and the experience is my kids drop toys or there's cables or it gets stuck underneath something and it just doesn't work that well whereas a yard there's really nothing in your yard and so you can basically let these things go wild um 247 so I think robot vacuums as a uh opportunity category is really interesting um and I think that uh if I was to do anything I would probably build a robot vacuum uh lawnmower review website so I would do the best deep dive wire cutter style reviews of the robot lawnmowers focus on SEO and then do affiliate or something like that um other opportunities I think that um you could certainly buy a dealership or something like that that could be interesting the idea that I actually had was to start a lawnmowing company or buy a lawnmowing company that has a ton of customers and instead of having laborers go do the work you just pre-program everyone's yard and you literally just show up on Monday for example you drop the little drone and it goes and cuts their yard and then you pick it up at the end of the day and you just do that for a whole bunch of different people and so if you think about it a landscaping business it's a hard crappy business because um you know the margins are okay you kind of have a 15 to 30% margin but it's a lot of Blue Collar work and highly seasonal and if you think about it with this you could have like 10 robot mowers and just every day you go to 10 different houses and drop them off and pick them up at the end of the day and you make all the money basically pure profit other than the cost of maintenance on the mower so um kind of a random fun one it is random it got me thinking this is sort of a tangent but it got me thinking I'm not sure if this is a trend but uh in my house in Canada there's seven houses there and the the snow there's a lot of snow there there's a ton of snow uh obviously and the guy who was clearing the snow just was raising his prices raising his prices raising his prices to to the point there you know people got upset so one of the guys on my street was like I've got a pickup truck I'm just going to go buy one of those plows and I'm going to knock on the seven houses and we'll just this will be uh I'll do it and and we'll just it I'll do it just for the street so I think that there's so okay so for your robot idea I'm wondering like the you know the quickest way to start it maybe it's you do something like that where you're like I'm doing robot um mowing just for the Eight houses on my street shh don't tell anyone but I've got 30 plus startup ideas that could make you millions and I'm giving them away for for free these aren't just random guesses they're validated Concepts from entrepreneurs who built $100 million plus businesses I've compiled them into one simple database compiled from hundreds of conversations I've had on my podcast but the main thing is most of these ideas don't need a single investor some cost nothing to start I'm pretty much handing you a cheat sheet the idea bank is your startup shortcut just click below to get access your next cash flowing business is waiting for you totally I think you could probably do it as a neighborhood um I think if you have money what I would do is I'd go and buy a small landscaping company that has like 20 or 30 customers and I would just start very gently experimenting so it's like you know you take one house you see does the owner notice does the owner do the math does the owner go and buy their own robot mower because these mowers are5 to $7,000 and so not that many people are going to go and buy it um now they might try and get a discount I think it depends on the person but there's a certain class of person it that just goes if the mowing is good I don't give a [ __ ] I just want to pay an amount and I want it to just get handled um so yeah I think it's kind of interesting it doesn't worry you at all that it's like such a physical business so like when I when I hear this business I'm like wow on one hand this is really interesting like this could be a money printer but on the other hand software is so much like I understand it so much more so how do you think about that well I think it's a Launchpad business I I think um the the digital version of it where you do lawnmower reviews or whatever I think is relatively scalable it's probably like a business you can make like 300K to a million dollars a year but the physical stuff is much more for the scrappy person who doesn't know where to start and is willing to spend 5K or something on a startup business that can make them 100 to 200k a year I always think the goal for any entrepreneur starting out is to make 100 to 200k a year after that everything is upside and gravy but that gives you the Launchpad with which to launch the good businesses so you need the the mediocre business first um usually and I think you know if someone can start an affiliate website for this that's better than having a physical mowing company but the physical mowing company is so easy to get going with in my opinion so I don't know I think it's like those kind of businesses appeal to me because they're simple and they're not going anywhere and there's no like SEO rug pull that can really happen but um but I hear you it's not highly scalable and then just curious like do you you know affiliate businesses like how do you think about them do you like them um curious in tiny do you own a couple well I remember I was talking to one um one guy who's got a huge newsletter and he said with one mention of athletic greens I can make $50,000 and I was like oh my God that's kind of crazy and I think affiliate has a bad reputation because um you know affiliate marketing is kind of like hey I'll go out and I'll make some cheesy ad and you'll click it because you want penis pills or something like that and then I'll get a commission that's like affiliate marketing OG version when I think about affiliate marketing I just think of it as capturing the money The Advertiser would otherwise make so let's say that I have a you know let's say I have a newsletter with 100,000 subscribers and I'm charging $5,000 for an ad we know the ad Advertiser is making $20,000 off that ad or $110,000 off that that ad if they're smarter and I think it's just capturing more of that than what you get paid upfront and you're taking a little more risk so that's the way I think about affiliate I don't think that um affiliate if you're if you have a newsletter it all comes down to like how much of a moe do you have around your audience so like if you're on Twitter You Know You're vulnerable to the algorithm but it's free to post um you know but if you have a newsletter it's direct to the consumer and you basically can keep pounding that as you know as long as you want so I think if you're dependent on it and it's SEO vulnerable or algorithm vulnerable then yeah it's a bad business but if you have this audience you've built for free like you or me it's kind of like I I see no downside as long as you're not doing something that's horrible like I've put um I recommend stuff on my my newsletter and like if it's an Amazon link I'm like yeah why not you know I want to get paid for that sure totally yeah I mean PE you would put the link there anyways it's it's so why not I actually probably know the person you're talking about with the athletic green do yeah um and that person makes 40 to $60,000 a month on athletic green commissions it's crazy so athletic greens and I I I I feel bad even saying the word athletic greens because we are not getting paid for this um but athletic greens uh I believe was doing 30% of affiliate um lifetime commissions so that means if you become on a subscription I don't know what it cost but let's say $100 a month and you you know you're going to get paid $30 a month until that customer turns it's crazy and and if you think about it it's um I don't even know that athletic greens is a great product or anything like that but I think that it's too big to fail in that there's too many people making too much money from it that they all want it to keep going you know like sahill or or huberman or any of these people that do this that talk about ag1 they want it to persist right because they're going to make so much money from it and I don't think it's like bad for you by any means but I think odds are it's like their margin on it is probably like 90% And so they have a lot of money to play with for affiliate and they can differentiate by getting these huge influential people to talk about it as a result it's actually a really interesting strategy if you think about it because the greens products have been around forever like that's not a new idea it's just someone came out and was like let's apply this business model to that yeah 100% so that's the Creator affiliate piece and then there's the directory affiliate piece so I've been incre I've been increasingly obsessed with creating directories like curated directories and then just plugging an affiliate deals um and the reason why is in a world where there's so much information out there people now want curation that's one and then number two um with programmatic SEO IE you know looking at what people are searching for and creating landing pages at scale um there's a huge opportunity right now um to to basically create a bunch of directories so my I'm curious what you think but you know if I was just starting out right now one of the things I would do is say is create one directory a month in different topics where this lawnmowing idea could be one topic did you see um what Sam par did with accounting firms Sam's Sam's list yes I don't know how it's worked out for him but I thought that was really smart um I do wonder about the longevity of that like I don't use Google anymore like for everything I go on perplexity or chat GPT now and so if you build an affiliate directory they're just going to scrape that and then it'll inform the results and you'll never get your links in or credit or anything like that so I don't really know if it's a good long-term strategy I mean how do you think about something like that is that like I guess You' just link the directory on your socials or something like that and if you have a proprietary link then it's fine yeah well I'm not of the belief that SEO is going to die like the you know I think SEO is going to evolve if I was building this what I would do is is I think there's a moment in time right now where there's just Arbitrage with respect to SEO and AI tool so I'd go I'd build it as much as possible and then I would try to convert 8% 6% 10% of these people to to email basically um that way worst case scenario you're not like reliant on you know if the world switches to perplexity the whole world then you're not reliant on um you know the the search traffic although I do think that eventually um these perplexities are going to give credit to where they're getting information from yeah I mean I wouldn't be too concerned about it especially because it is that Launchpad kind of business right it's like you really need this to work for a couple years it's going to cost you zero and you can make hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars and that's fine um I'm curious when you start these directories who is doing your follow through execution because my problem is always like I have the idea and I have the social funnel like I I have similar audience to you and stuff but I think you're doing a far better job of figuring out how to actually monetize it and track the funnel and stuff who's doing that for you are you doing that yourself or do you have a team I have a a business partner his name is Jordan and Jordan is your quintessential funnel guy so you know you wake up in the morning and you're excited about ideas he wakes up in the morning and he's excited about how do I how do I squeeze this funnel and I think that uh the the old way of creating startups was you know technical founder and maybe maybe a designer maybe a business guy now I think today you kind of need idea Galler guy and a funnel guy or gal totally so I basically come up with an idea give it to Jordan um you know now I'm using I don't know if you've used v0 but I use versel v0 which is basically a tool to use AI to wireframe out the ideas so I wireframe out the ideas um and he he really takes those ideas and then he dispatches it to a group of people I will say ideas die unless they unless they you need an owner basically for an idea um and so that's something I've learned is unless I have like one GM or one person on this idea the idea loses steam despite the funnel uh funnel Guy totally um let's move uh let's move to the to the next idea okay so um Apple watch just released this thing where it will diagnose you with sleep apnea for people that don't know sleep apnea is a disorder where while you're sleeping you're basically kind of are snoring and your throat gets a little closed and you basically have this you stop breathing briefly and so it's like sometimes your you know if your partner's in bed with you they might hear you like gasping or stopping breathing or whatever but a lot of people just don't know they have it in fact 80 to 90% of people who have sleep apnea are undiagnosed um now a lot of people wear Apple watches and it'll just automatically one day pop up a little alert and say dude you have sleep apnea and people are going to be like what the hell is sleep apnea and what do I do and so I think there's a big opportunity for this um I think that there's going to be a lot of beneficiaries specifically sleep apnea clinics so there's these very rigorous processes you have to go through in order to get what's called a CPAP machine a CPAP machine is this thing that you wear over your mouth or over your nose and it pushes air down your throat basically to keep your away clear and in order to get one uh you have to go through this process of like getting formally diagnosed and talking to your doctor and getting a prescription and stuff and so these guys have a strangle hold on um on the hardware so you have a distributorship for like ResMed or one of these guys uh they charge like $2,000 for the machine so I I think one opportunity is simply just going out and buying a whole bunch of sleep sleep apnea clinics and just betting on the macro you just say look I think more and more people will get diagnosed and we're going to sell a lot more Hardware um another way to do this would be to invest in the companies uh to do something similar we talked about a site where you review these uh different Hardwares and stuff the other thing that's interesting is a lot of people don't want to wear these CPAP machines I mean for good reason you look like Bane from Batman uh you have this huge ridiculous thing on your face and you know imagine like you're going home with a girl you just met and you have to put on your CPAP machine like no one wants to do that and so so I think there's going to be more and more people popping up with alternative treatments so there's these like oral devices that you can get these appliances and I think that if somebody did a really good job of D toc on that I'm sure there's already providers out there already but I think things like that will do very well the other idea I had is potentially to spin up an app that uses Apple's data from your Apple watch to monitor your sleep apnea uh in more depth or something or coach you through it um and then the other idea I had was maybe doing a financing business that relates to buying the hardware I'm sure that these places all offer financing but maybe there's some kind of like you know you advertise you know to people that you know have sleep apnea as the financer of choice or whatever for these devices um yeah I like this one a lot I'm I'm wondering you know okay why do I like it a lot is new technology comes out Apple watch le apnea detect feature and most people look at it and they're like cool but not enough people look at it and be like okay what does this change and what business ideas can I can I come up with yeah I think that uh the same could be said for blood glucose another bet would be to say you know in the next five years Apple will probably have a blood glucose sensor and that people will start monitoring things like that in their health more and more and more and these are going to be big super cycle Trends um so I think yeah literally like one tiny tweak to the Apple watch is enough for you know millions or hundreds of millions of people to suddenly start thinking about a new health Trend that they weren't previously aware of I mean I've been wearing a continuous glucose monitor from Dexcom for probably seven years so I'm aware of blood sugar and it's quite shocking when you start monitoring your blood sugar all these Foods you think are healthy that actually aren't and I think that's a huge potential Trend harder to profit on than the sleep apnea one but um yeah there's lots of stuff like that quick ad break let me tell you about a business I invested in it's called boring marketing.com so a few years ago I met this group of people that were some of the best SEO experts in the world they were behind getting some of the biggest companies found on Google and the secret sauce is they've got a set of technology and AI that could help you outrank your competition so for my my own businesses I wanted that I didn't want to have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I didn't want to depend on ads to drive customers to my businesses I wanted to rank high in Google that's why I like SEO and that's why I use boring marketing.com and that's why I invested in it they're so confident in their approach that they offer a 30-day Sprint with 100% money back guarantee who does that nowadays so check it out highly recommend boring marketing.com so I don't know if you've been using lo as like a ideas partner but I have recently and while you were talking I just wanted to prompt it I'll share my screen show you what I what I prompted it why do you use clo instead of and instead of chat GPT because I'm French Canadian and is you know sure yeah no uh it's it's honestly 30% better like every answer you're get is 30% better um so the thing the thing is chat GPT was better and then clo recently caught up now chat GPT is getting better but right now as we're recording this Cloe is where you want to be H so I asked it and for people who don't who don't who are not watching on YouTube I just said what are the illnesses like sleep apneia that are undiagnosed 80 to 90% of cases are undiagnosed and then it gives me a list hypertension type 2 diabetes celiac disease but when I was going through this I realized that you know the Apple watch is not going to you know be helpful for depression or might not be helpful for depression so I said you could identify I asked clo you could identifi sleep apnea with an Apple Watch what are other undiagnosed illnesses like this and then that's when it starts listing it off apib which is arterial fib fation many smart watches including the Apple watch can detect irregular heart rhythms that indicate apib and then these you know very interesting and I think millions of people have that hypertension uh diabetes Stress and Anxiety like how cool is this well I think it's crazy like I just went through um ADHD diagnosis and it's not rocket science yeah right it's all stuff that could have been done with AI like they basically um they put you through like a a memory test and some cognitive testing they sit with you for an hour and they you know basically just go go through a checklist and ask you a bunch of questions they go through like a process of like you know you tick boxes based on like symptoms and all that kind of stuff and I think there's something really crappy about the fact that in order to get diagnosed with a disorder with which really impacts a lot of people it could be anxiety depression ADHD you name it you have to spend thousands of dollars or have insurance or whatever I think my diagnosis was like $2,000 and I I recently saw a friend of mine is creating a startup to do this to basically diagnose you go through like a you just say like something is wrong with me like I don't know what what it is but like something's wrong with me and just do a mental health assessment and it uses AI to basically say like hey here's an entire picture of your mental health and here's all the ways that you could potentially tackle it and I think that's really freaking cool um and I think ADHD in general actually is a huge opportunity area I think more and more people are recognizing it and it is widely undiagnosed they estimate between 10 and 20% of people have it so I think that's another interesting one too I think you're right I think you're right let's keep rolling let's go to idea number three so my next one this one is very uh very half-baked but I think that computer vision was something that was kind of like you know always 5 to 10 years away like I would see some cool startup come out in Silicon Valley and they would say oh you know you can install these sensors in your building or in your Supermarket or whatever and it'll do all this crazy stuff um but it was always this thing where it was like you got to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars it's not accessible to normal people um and a lot of people don't know this but we own like four or five restaurants we own a deli and a bunch of other stuff and in that Deli there's a few things I would really love to understand so one like basically what I want to do is like put a webcam like a simple webcam or even just take an old iPhone and just like put it up in a corner with a power cable or something like that and I would love to see like a heat map of like okay where are people going where are they buying where are they lingering what are they skipping and then I also love the idea of anonymized facial recognition so the idea of saying this many people coming through the door are repeat customers the repeat customers all come at 8: a.m. the new customers come on this day at this time and I think that it would be really really interesting and then the other thing that would be cool is to see where do people get confused or mixed up where you know they walk back and forth in certain places um and I just to me I feel like the technology is finally here to do this and I think it could be done very very cheaply and I'm sure someone has done this in an Enterprise situation I I guarantee this exists what I want is for the you know the small business owner to be able to access this to install an app on your iPhone and just Mount your iPhone somewhere did you see that demo of that guy and he he had those Rayband sunglasses with the hidden camera and he was walking around New York and when he walked up to people it would use facial recognition and tell them who they were and what they did and do you see that no I didn't see that oh dude it's the craziest thing so he's in a subway station and he's wearing these glasses and he would walk up to people and he'd go oh my God are you Greg Eisenberg you're from the startup ideas podcast and the people would be like oh like thank you yes I am and they'd be friendly because they think they know this guy but they don't it's just whispered in his ear what who this person is and what they do and all this stuff and so he's literally going up to people and like random people and at the subway terminal there's always interesting people someone's like a great philanthropist and then another guy is working on like some important political thing and he starts conversations with all of them and so it's this kind of vaguely terrifying Tech demo but at the same time I was like how cool is this that you could basically meet all these Fascinating People Like do you ever go to like a nice hotel and you look around and you're like all these people can afford to spend like23 th000 a night for a room I bet there's tons of interesting business people here but I'll never know who they are that's really really cool yeah I I could see a world where you walk into your favorite store and it knows that you like listening to Drake and it's like cue the Drake song Craig walking in totally um that's really cool I uh when I was uh I was head of product strategy at wework and not many people know this but wew work at one of the best AI ml teams in in technology and one of the most interesting use cases that we had I don't think we end ended up uh really productizing it but it was this idea that using uh every wwor has cameras and how can you identify if there's smoke how can you you know smoke that can turn into a fire how can you identify if someone has a gun that walks in how can you identify if someone has a knife and to me that was like forget like uh the co-working business like that piece of technology was the most interesting piece of technology that we work ever had that's so cool I've actually read recently about something like this but it was in like a they were replacing the security guards in like you know sketchy high schools with this kind of technology and stuff I mean th this stuff is like so pen Opticon where I struggle with it because on one hand I think it's so cool and on the other hand it's like absolute power corrupts absolutely and like whose hands is this stuff in like I guess my question would be like how would you feel if you walked into my Deli and you found out I'm using like facial tracking technology even if it's anonymized like I just think this is one of these things that our generation might be uncomfortable with but our kids probably won't think twice about but it is kind of creepy when you think about it it is creepy I feel like on digital products we all kind of know it's happening but in the physical world it it takes it to the next level I think there I think there will be some backlash I mean how cool would it be if like you walk into my Deli and the like guy behind the counter gets a little notification and it's like oh Greg loves salami whatever and he's like Greg so great to see you I've got you know do you want salami again right like think of how good you would feel but it would be maybe a bit creepy if it was done poorly someone in the comment section is gonna be like bro when I walk into my Deli my guy gives me some salami when I walk and I don't need some AI to help me do it yeah totally uh okay another one um I'm huge on this so when Chris and I were running the business day today like when we were running our agency we were absolute Maniacs about negotiation so anything that we bought from office furniture to vendor contracts to software to even the coffee beans that we bought in bulk for the staff we negotiated everything we would go get multiple quotes we'd pit them against each other we would negotiate on payment terms all sorts stuff and we saved an insane amount of money doing that and I realized before that I would just kind of be like well the price is the price and then Chris was a big Haggler and got me to read a bunch of books I realized no the price is not the price most people um if you ask them will give you a big huge discount and so um what I found over time though was as our company got bigger I had to delegate negotiation and no one wants to do negotiation an employee does not care to do negotiation first of all it's really awkward it's really really uncomfortable two it slows everything down you know if you just want to choose the desk you want to buy and just buy it and to get the deal takes like three weeks sometimes so it's time and uh and then incentive why do they care right it's like why is it worth it for them to spend all this time and money to save a couple thousand dollars to you that's a couple thousand of profit to them what does that mean it's like maybe another couple dollars on their bonus or something something like that and so I have been it's kind of been driving me crazy and I've tried to train people over and over again I've been like hey read like this negotiation book or use like you know use this GPT bot or whatever but nobody ever does it and so we actually started a company called Tech Source about six months ago and we started another one even three or four years ago which we sold to ramp actually um which is so why we like recreated this business basically but what it does is it negotiates software on your behalf so Amazon S3 any enterprise software HubSpot ripling you know you name it anything that you use they will basically evaluate what what you're using how many seats you have and then they'll go negotiate and do the procurement on your half and the savings are insane like we've saved people like 60 70% across some of their largest um vendors so I'm obsessed with this idea but for everything so if I want to buy a house I want to literally be like hey that's the house I want you call the guy and you save me as much for every you're gonna I'm going to give you 20% of everything you save under a certain amount if the asking price is a million bucks and you get it for 800k I'll give you 25% of the savings and I think that is a very interesting business idea it really works best obviously with big purchases houses cars that kind of stuff but doing an acquisition of a a car or a host it's not a lot of work you could probably do the actual negotiation in a few hours and so I think this is a great business for somebody who a loves to negotiate and then B would want to train up a Salesforce to do this and that could be as simple as going to the Philippines or Latin America and just getting these people to read a couple books and Hyper incentivizing them and aligning them and giving them an llm so like as they're going through it they just like type the email respon resp in and they like rewrite the email accordingly or something um but yeah I love this idea and I want to be a customer of whoever does it yeah I think this is also one of those ideas that um make sense right now because so many companies are trying to reduce costs right now so you're swimming you know swimming Downstream here you're not swimming Upstream so and and I agree with you there's so many different verticals that you can take this in so yeah I like it yeah I think especially people um they don't think enough about these big purchases you know they'll say like well you know the asking price on that house was X and you know it had previously sold for y and I think that just there's no price Discovery right at the end of the day anyone who sold a house like I've sold houses where the listing price is like a hope and a dream and then there's been other times where it's completely firm and I'm not willing to go under but if someone asked the right question of me they would pretty quickly learn how much flexibility I have on pricing and stuff um so yeah I think that's a that's a really cool one um the other one that I have I've got let's see I've got two more so the next one um I looked into this recently because I'm getting older and as you get older your sperm quality gets worse and they actually show that um older fathers have uglier children so the older you get the uglier and less symmetrical your kids faces will be not for sure there's lots of good-looking people uh who have good-look kids even when they're old um but so you know your risk of complications and autism and all sorts of other stuff go up and so I think this is something that a lot of people should be doing and very few people I know are and I think the reason that people don't do sperm freezing is a you know no one really talks about it um two it's not something that's marketed to you you know I've never seen an ad for sperm freezing and then three it's an awkward process I don't want to go to some weird weird clinic and go and have to like uh jerk off in a weird room with like I like I don't know it just seems very awkward and I think that if someone made it easy where I could impulse purchase it so let's say that I go I see an ad for it or some Instagram influencer talks about it I click a link and they literally just ship you a package with dry ice and you do it at home and then ship it back like I think that could be really successful um this is a hard business to execute on because you need licensing and you need a facility and all sorts of other stuff but I think whoever does it could do really really well just checking the uh Google Trends data on on sperm freezing and you can just see that it's you know it's going up like there's more and more interest in sperm freezing and you're right I've never I've never once seen an ad for any of this um so I think there's an opportunity to build like a real brand here oh it looks like there is there are a couple companies doing this though it's interesting Legacy is one and then there's like but when I Google when I Google sperm freezing the number one Google search result is joh no ad which is like that's crazy you love to see it that is how is there no ad you love to see it that that alone I'm like that's crazy that there's no one advertising on literally same with me in my area literally I Googled sperm freezing and there's no ad that's like a huge opportunity whenever you see that that's like a it's like a lottery ticket I almost don't want to air this episode and I want to I want to edit that out and I'm gonna build this in Canada right now that's crazy I wonder I'm gonna ask uh chat gbt because I'm not French Canadian what um what uh what would be required to start a sperm testing facility or sorry sperm Banking and while you're doing that I got a couple names for sperm freezing we can do like ice cold sperm.com there's a lot of really great name possibilities for that let's see okay so SP banks are regulated in Canada they're regulated they have to be screened strict procedures me look up startup costs but also just doing lead gen even you know just buy the keywords sell the leads yeah totally totally well it's like there's that company it's I think it's called Legacy it looks like there's one Legacy at home maybe we just go buy that company before this goes live yeah like this looks great but yeah it does not okay oh interesting analysis so it looks like they have okay so they have a home sperm testing they have home sperm Improvement and they have home sperm freezing give legacy.com let's see if they've raised money so they raised money in July actually so pretty recently interesting and they raised it from like Silicon Valley people or yeah I'm going to follow this guy on um AE and message him when do you know when you see an idea out there like you have an idea and then you you start you do some Googling and you're like oh man there's someone doing it when do you know to continue or to stop well I think what I like is to say um okay that guy's doing it in in the states why don't I just copy this exact thing in Canada right because like and and ultimately for me it comes down to two things one how hard is the idea to execute and how costly would I need to raise money for it or is this thing I could just bootstrap myself and how long to get validation but separately from that it's ultimately who's the CEO going to be because that's the big problem I always have is like I can have the world's best idea but I'm not going to be able to run it I've got tiny I've got all these other things going on so I need someone who can just take the Baton and run with it and then I can just like help promote it strategize all that kind of stuff um so that that's the that's the key thing uh okay it's looking like estimated startup costs of oh not too bad like well okay so it's like probably 20 or $30,000 a month to have all this stuff it's like a bit of a bit of a pain in the ass to start but it it's definitely interesting I wonder if you could go in lease space from an existing sperm bank and just say like hey like give us like a shelf to start and then we'll exactly yeah H interesting that actually I feel that's the move this is a good idea I actually think this is really interesting if anyone's listening to this and wants to start this business uh they should email me and Greg because we will fund you yes we will um okay um I think we got one last idea yeah so um basically uh I have you have you ever done like EO or YPO Forum I've never done it so I had a friend invite me to EO when I was 20 and I was just starting my company and I walk into the room and it's all these 40 to 50y old dudes who have like blue collar businesses or they're like investment managers or like you know they guys that wear suits like business people and I was immediately allergic to that because I was like you know a 20-year-old in a hoodie who's in TCT and none of these people were in TCH and my immediate thought was like well what can I learn from these guys like this is like so pointless and I kind of say as much to my friend and he says no no no dude trust me you should join this just make sure you do this thing called forum and I had no idea what that was but it turned out that EO Forum or YPO forum is a format where once a month you and five or six other entrepreneurs go into a conference room and you share everything that's going on in your life so personal family and business and so on day one of my first forum I walk in the room it's a guy who runs a mapping company someone who runs a popsicle company another guy ran a a puzzle company a woodworking shop and I forget there's a couple others and I'm just like man like this is like I'm not going to learn anything this doesn't make any sense fast forward 10 years later and there's some of my best friends actually 15 years later this was like 15 almost 20 years ago actually and one of them is the executive of my will so these are actually my most trusted confidants and what happened was over the course of time you know we all started out kind of nervous and we wouldn't share we just talk about our businesses we'd be cautious but over time like [ __ ] happens like people get divorced people deal with co-founder issues people can't make payroll they deal with like a psycho uh employee all this stuff happens and you become this like bonded Band of Brothers and I found that has a it's been like so helpful for me just for like making amazing friends but then B also like in business everything tastes like chicken and like talking about your problems is really rewarding as a group um and so I had this experience of like deeply forged friendships occur when you have this ritual where you do this monthly thing in a rhythm and you share and you're deep and personal and there's shared trust because one of the key things in forum is nothing leaves the room it's totally confidential and so I've been thinking a lot about that and I think it's kind of a gift to be in business and get to do that because we have this shared language if you and I met and we didn't have our businesses we it would be harder for us to get along I'm sure we'd find all sorts of stuff to talk about but when you're in business you just have this shared language and you can Bond and so I actually I had a friend who was struggling with alcoholism and I went to an AA meeting like maybe two years ago and I was like oh my God this is like Forum in an AA meeting you stand up there's a whole ritual you stand up everything's confidential you share these crazy stories of what's going on in your life or you tell stories or whatever and there's this feeling of like connectedness and like friendship and bonding and it's like it's like church or something like that and so I think that there's an opportunity to create more of these sorts of groups and I think sometimes they need to be around interests and sometimes they just need to be about friendship or group therapy because ultimately you're kind of doing group therapy and so um you know Sam par did like Hampton for entrepreneurs which is very similar to this I think it would be interesting to try and find other subgroups where you can convince five or six people to get together in a format and share and so the kind of grownup way people do this is like dinner parties and book groups I think something deeper than that would be interesting so it's like right now I've got this I've got my business forums I've got four different business forums that I do I do one a week but then I've also been meeting with this group of guys to talk about doing like a secular church and what I mean by that is not like starting a cult but just like having a weekly event that we do with a group of people and their families and trying to build that sense of community and so I don't know what is here I know there's something here but I I I think it's a very unformed idea but I think in this world where everything is going more and more online and churches exist less and less I think people are looking for this sense of community and there's a really great opportunity to do that not only to make money but also just to make great friends and do something positive this this gets me thinking of My Buddy started his name is Antonio nevs he started something in Los Angeles called man mornings and he used to get together with a group of guys that um they used to just like drink basically um and he he realized that the you know the best conversations and the most bonding happens with you know in the mornings around coffee and this is a guy who like I'm pretty sure he was like a moderator for Ted um and he's like a professional moderator professional speaker and um he doesn't try away that it's for men you know it's like men need to share their feelings and men need to and I really appreciate that I'm not saying you know yes it is like a boy club but you know that could happen for females it could happen for other people my point is I think that one of the reasons why it's your point one of the reasons why it's so successful and Tony is is doing so well with it is because yeah these people are looking for something more they want to share and they're becoming best friends in this like it's just a coffee or going for a walk it's beautiful totally I think it's um probably the most rewarding thing that I've done is building these Forum groups and seeing how inner connected I've created I've created all these webs of friends who they're all people I knew for the most part individually but now they're all friends and like it's crazy like I have groups where when everyone met they were all really nervous and now we all go on annual trips every year and like we're just super super connected like the really circle of trust and to have 20 or 30 people people that are deep trust is like a really unique thing in this day and age I feel like um there's definitely like an epidemic of loneliness where most people can't name you know two or three good friends that they have let alone 20 so yeah it's it's really powerful I don't know that it's a huge money maker I think like Sam and what he's doing with Hampton is because it's like high net worth CEOs um but I think you could probably find other niches where it would be profitable but mostly this is a how do you make your life awesome like I think about the concept I said this to Nick Gray I was like you know you most people think they want to be a billionaire what they actually want is to be a friend billionaire why do you want to be a billionaire because you've watched honorage you know you're like oh if I have a billion dollars or I'm famous then you know I'll be like Vinnie Chase driving around with my Entourage of Bros and it'll be good times and parties and girls and all this stuff and in reality that's not what happens people get rich and they get like sad and isolated and people treat them different ly and stuff and so they really want to be a friend billionaire and I think like Nick is doing interesting work in that area of how do you ensure that your life is vibrant you're constantly meeting new people you have deep friendships uh you're a magnet for interesting people like I think that is actually far more interesting than making money I couldn't agree more and the the funny part is though is that like Tony who started man mors who did it out of the goodness of his heart I wouldn't be surprised if that turns into like a really big business uh you know just because there's he's so passionate about it and people want it so badly not only not only that but the business it's not about like if you think about it you are building this network like people pay2 200 or $300,000 a year to go to Harvard or something like that and the reason they do that is not because the education in Harvard is so much better it is maybe a little bit better but mostly it's that you're going to school with all these super influential wealthy people that in the future will benefit you because they're going to hire you for a job or give you opportunities or something I think increasing your opportunity surface area by having a really interesting broad group of friends where you have high trust is amazing because that Tony guy maybe he makes no money on that business or this isn't even a business just something he does for fun but certainly if he ever starts a business in the future maybe one of his investors or earliest employees or co-founder comes from that group I just think bad things have never happened to me when I put myself out there well I mean you get trolls on Twitter and stuff but like generally bad things don't happen when you put yourself out there and you build a great group of friends and high trust and that kind of stuff it's a beautiful place to end Andrew tot Namaste thanks for coming on Namaste where could uh where could people get to know you better I will I will say I just read your book never enough and I loved it than so thank you I mean the best way to get to know me probably is to read my book uh it's kind of a memoir about building my business so if you want to understand me and how I tick and how I got to where I am that is the best way uh you can check it out at never enough.com and I also do a newsletter and a podcast where I really just kind of like talk to people I'm interested in and share products and stuff random stuff I'm interested in um and then if you have a business bus you want to sell uh you should go to tiny.com and you should email me and I'd love to buy your business if it's really good that's my primary thing that's what I I do for a living especially if it's a sperm freezing business yes yes sperm free highly profitable sperm freezing or sleep apnea business you know who to call all right thanks man I'll catch you later thanks dude byebye [Music] it's baby

Title: Essential AI Coding Fundamentals I wish I knew sooner (ChatGPT, Cursor AI, v0)
Published: 2024-10-11 18:00:04 UTC
Description:
In this episode, I am joined byJason Zhou, product manager & YouTuber, where we dive deep into AI coding  fundamentals. Jason shares his unique insights into how to use and set up AI to streamline to the process of building you next app. Learn how to use AI like a pro!

56:04 Conclusion: Structuring AI Coding for Success
57:53 Where to Find More Resources and Tutorials

1) The problem: Large language model coding is unpredictable. Tutorials make it look easy, but reality is different. Jason's solution? A structured workflow for more consistent results.

2) Step 1: Write detailed specs upfront
- Simulate how product teams work in reality
- Uncover uncertainties early
- Include project overview, core functionality, and implementation docs

3) Step 2: Use the right tools for the job
- Cursor for functionality
- V0 for UI touchups
- This order leads to more success than trying everything at once

4) Step 3: Develop reusable modular prompts
- Create a collection of standard functionalities (e.g., user auth, payment)
- Share these prompts within the community
- Speeds up development process significantly

5) Pro tip: When writing specs, think like a product manager AND an engineering manager. Use tools like ChatGPT to help fill in the gaps and create more detailed PRDs.

6) Debugging hack: When Cursor gives vague errors, ask it to "add debug info to the code". This gives you more context to communicate the issue effectively.

7) UI design strategy:
- Build functionality first
- Use V0 for UI improvements later
- Provide style examples (e.g., "similar to Vercel") for better results

8) Jason's secret weapon: Modular prompts for common features
- Example: Auth setup prompt that works across projects
- Saves time and ensures consistency

9) The future of AI coding?
- Aggregators for modular prompts
- New ways to integrate prompts into developer tools
- More streamlined workflows (like Bolt) to automate manual steps

10) Remember: This approach might feel more structured than expected, but compare it to traditional development - it's still a massive improvement!

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
Jason what are we going to learn this episode yeah uh so I think what I want to introduce today is like my workflow of AI [Music] coding yeah um awesome yeah so the part I want to share a little bit is that uh the how do you get the large langage model or AI coding flow uh streamline so that you can get a more predicable result so problem we really want to solve is that larger ler model based coding is probably the hardest Topic at the moment uh everyone is learning it uh but and everyone when you like look at tutorial online often you get a vibe that you can just prompt ask it to build something and just build the whole thing out for you uh but in reality I think once you start using it uh you realize the result is really un pedable um because the nature of large Lang model is kind of you hallucinate a little bit uh so every time you start trying you'll just get a bunch of arrows uh not exactly the uh smooth selling you will see from the tutorial that people add it a couple times um and uh so what I try to solve is like okay I've been try to explore is there any kind of workflow that we can try to get the AI coding a bit more consistent read out uh and uh this the kind of thing I want to showcase today uh it's actually fairly simple and straightforward like the one of the most first and most important thing is like I would spend a lot of time up front to actually write very clear and detailed specs um and uh I know many people already talk about it I know one of your previous podcast also mentioned like planning up up front is important but uh I don't think a lot of people talk about in details like how should you actually write a spec right what are steps you should take to get a spec that can communicate with C very well uh and the process I think eventually want to simulate is how like product team working r normally you have PM kind of right on the spec of the core functionality you don't want cover and then you would hand over to engineer manager to kind of spec out like individ tickets or the architecture of the uh project structure so it leaves much less ambiguity for later uh so we probably want to do something similar which I will showcase a uh example uh and benefit of that is like you start really getting uncover a lot of uncertainty UPF front and taking out the planning work a f cursor um a lot to get a more consistent result uh so this kind of one thing and second is like also be very clear about the role of different platform uh so there are different tools like cursor VZ uh replate uh but it's not very clear often when to use what and the best thing I found is like you kind of want to get cursor to just focus on functionality and uh don't even just don't even think about UI at the beginning and then you start using vzer to like touch up uh U UI interface bit by bit and this will get you like a lot more success and try to get to everything at once um and third thing I found is quite like uh interesting to think about is like how can you have reusable modular prompt um so uh they are already uh kind of things people try like uh cursor do directory where people share like the collection of cursor rules uh by found like cursor rules most of the time is actually not that useful um there it didn't like deliver too much B results what's really interesting is that there are actually features and functionalities are pretty standard uh if you try to spin up like 10 different star ideas uh you don't want to rebut like sign in user o uh it's always same same like payment so as a community can we have this kind of collection of those reusable modular prompt you can just give to cursor and it will spit out whole functionality for you I think that's really useful and I can showcase one like prompt I have been reused again again for like user o to show how this work um yeah this is this is really exciting and I'll explain why so writing clear and detailed specs is something I think is an art uh more than a science and it's something I don't know how to do really well so I look forward to figuring out how to do that two cursor first v0 second everyone does the opposite everyone does vzer first put your ideas out there get the wireframes and then go cursor so I look forward to figuring out uh why you say that um I'm I'm I'm interested in that and then the third like the reusable modular promps like I know I should be doing this I just don't know how I can leverage them where I could find them so this is this is the Hard video that people actually need to sit through um because it's way more fun to sit through a here's a 20 minute Co coding an IOS app using AI coding but it's way more hard to sit through here's what you actually need to do to transition from being a yeah I've used cursor before or I've used AI coding before to I'm now an AI coder yeah exactly uh and maybe that's because my kind of background my background is like product designer and product manager so like writing spec is kind of naturally it's the thing you kind of want to do uh there's a very big difference if you tell engineer team okay go build like a social media platform versus like here is the key features um and uh it's it's kind of similar thing and uh uh curse the cursor first and v0 second is also the thing because my background I normally kind of feel like I know what kind of product I want to build like prototyping is very easy um and uh it's pretty fast to do um but the hard part I also found is that if you keep it better open-ended uh often it doesn't give you what it want and once it have the structure to get a change to what you want is really really difficult um that's also kind of the reason um why is it um and uh and I think one thing probably to best way to do that is probably can take through example of how can we build a uh let's say application uh use this type of workflow uh but one thing too clear is that shh don't tell anyone but I've got 30 plus startup by ideas that could make you millions and I'm giving them away for free these aren't just random guesses they're validated Concepts from entrepreneurs who built hundred million plus businesses I've compiled them into one simple database compiled from hundreds of conversations I've had on my podcast but the main thing is most of these ideas don't need a single investor some cost nothing to start I'm pretty much handing you a cheat sheet the idea bank is your startup shortcut just click below to get access your next cash flowing business is waiting for you what this does I think from my experience really improve the success rate it didn't really promise that it will always get it right so or say if I get any curse for demo today so um one thing I want to actually uh since we're going to take through a uh case study uh I saw we can just RW some kind of interesting application uh and I know one of your video actually showcase a platform called gumy search which I really like I I think I heard about this platform from uh that video you made uh and I thought this pretty genius actually platform or utilize uh like application of large Lang model because it kind of use the best part of large L model that is really really good at which is like structure insights from unstructured data at very big scale um and I think if people use that one part is like when I try it out even though it's very interesting uh I need to pay $10 per day to gather it out so kind of cheap uh so I want to say okay let's maybe just repute this um and uh on the other hand I think this kind of model can probably also be used for other type of uh data as well I can totally imagine this similar interaction uh can be used for like Facebook group um Discord or other datas so it might be interestes startup have idea to try out to uh but anyway so I will showcase this example um first thing I will probably just try to create a uh Ripple so let's say t new so I also use start with uh GitHub so I have better version control uh and then I will open cursor of the project uh so the first thing I I actually want to do uh instead of like just you open the cursor and so hey build me this redit platform um I actually just start with a uh kind of draft spec um and uh the common structure are prob paste in a template the common structure is something look like this for me um so I will give it a little bit project overview uh about what's go uh and then break down the core functionality just like a normal product manager or designer do uh then there's a bunch of things that's actually very important to get it uh get it aligned one is that I would try to include some Doc docs about how to implement some key features uh so I know cursor have this functionality allowed to add uh insert uh the whole documentation but quite often I found it didn't work very well uh so what we want to do is actually I want to build some kind of proof concept early on um to making sure the core functionality is already very clearly sped out uh and later I also will try to in include like current file structure as well because quite often I found that uh one reason curs offer fail is because it has no idea about how the file project structured so it just create a file in wrong place wrong dependency so this will take out more uncertainty from the process and in the end I were adding some kind additional requirements so this is a part where uh depends on what type of project you're creating like if you're creating web app there just a bunch of things curs always get it wrong uh or or can can miss like uh you need to making sure uh like use use client or you want to making sure the file is creating in the right place making sure you use environment varibles things like that uh so I think eventually we can probably have set of like those additional common P for different type of project you created uh and for web application um like this is the ones that I often just use I was saving my noteb uh and uh when I create a web app I would just paste it in but it's IOS app you can probably have a different set of things uh like where should you create the purest and files uh when you use like API call making sure um you're sing the right way environment variable making sure you have aor handling things like that uh so let's firstly with the project overview um so project overview can be pretty simple um for this specific project I would probably just putting something like you are building a rad analytics plat form where users can get analytics of different subus where they can see top content and see the um category appro and as simple as that um but what's very important next is the core functionality so this is where your start like spit out what are the like M have feature for for the product um so if your product manager is probably pretty familiar uh it basically in this case I would say it has to be able to see a list of available Subarus and probably add a new Subarus uh you we need to build a a subit page to Showcase two tabs like top host and SS because from my use of gy search I found the most valuable part is like this categorization um so I will do that and then uh we need a way to fetch R post data in the top post as well as analysis uh of the RIT post data uh putting them into different seams uh so this kind of like a early spec uh and uh in here I kind of just try to keep it open like you don't need to um force yourself to write down every single detail but it should be clear enough to communicate what uh what is like goal of this project and the core functionalities um and this should give you good enough starting point um the next is that I want to start uh adding some docs um so this is where I will try to build some pral concept of the core functionalities so in our case we probably have two big Parts one is that we need to figure out a way to GA the uh subus posts uh we figure out which package to use and what's the code and second is that we also want to use open AI public structure output functionality to uh like GA the categorization of the posts uh and to do that normally we're go to like different place to do some research about package I want to use so for example for the first day the uh redit data I can go to chbt and say I'm building a next uh JS project and needs to Fat RIT data which package should I use to implement then you will probably get an understanding about uh what kind of packages they can use uh this is probably particularly useful for let's say uh things that already exist before like for R probably already exists before but for using you or do some Google search and once I understand the package in this case is snow wrap uh I can just go to mpm uh which is like package management to find that specific package um and in here you can either load the whole doc but I normally try to take a look at the examples to understand like how this work so here I always say like there are multiple different ways I can authenticate uh either through the refresh token or the username and password um so what did you can do next is that I want to start building some kind of pro concept uh so I can open uh this is the time like first time I start open uh cursor composer so I can add that uh documentation I already added here so it's right here snow wrap so I would say that um help me help me build a simple type script uh script to fatch subreddit posts from past 24 hours from a specific uh subedit let's say Doc uh including uh like post title uh link content score uh number of comments and I want to use a username and password uh as for us uh and also making sure you use Dov for credentials CU I don't I want to expose M um and then it rest start try to just create a very simple script hopefully uh to do this um and meanwhile um while we're doing this we actually need to get some credential for the uh Reddit as well so I think you need to go to Reddit perf uh slapps to create app uh this also part of the reason why you do this kind of research up front is useful because then you can like kind of get understanding of where to go uh to prepare everything so I can put a analytics and script the r our URL I just put Local Host for now and create app um and if I go back to here uh you can say okay this time it tried to create a script but didn't create a file for me for rethm but that's all good um we were just uh uh includeed script and I will create a Reddit dots pasting here uh and I also create a EMV file uh and uh I will need to put in the credential that we got here as well as secret and I'll put my username I just take out to put my password here okay once it's finished uh then I can go back to the terminal let's try to testing out um so I will do uh MPX TS node uh Reddit dots okay so this is kind of reason why you want to do this early on because you were start getting those arrows but if you try to uh not using those ones those Arrow will show up later as well uh so I call this Arrow help me debug is that what you usually say just help me debug yeah help me because uh depends if it's simple issue I will just uh take help me fix it uh but otherwise I will also like try to find rot cause let's think step by step where like using Ching of Ching of soft prompt uh okay so I got this one let me try again uh all right still get more arrows go this Arrow help me help me fix this let sync step by step okay I think I know why I need to tag this update this file for me based on changes above while this is happening it's crazy cuz you're a product manager now you're an engineer right so it's like what is the role of the product manager if you know because the old way of becoming a product manager was you'd write specs hand the specs over see product but now it's you write specs and you build product yeah exactly I kind of think like this AI coding start uh enable everyone become kind of product manager um and that's really really cool CU I I saw what's really unlock is a bunch of people who are consumers that don't do this codes now but you suddenly have this ability um okay perfect now you can see that it returned the result of the Reddit post so now we know this code example is going to work um then we can um paste this into the doc so here I will say uh document documentation for how to fatch uh Reddit posts using uh snow uh W uh and I can say code example and one thing I probably also do is like uh try to reference a little bit um like in this title I will put for number three so it's very clear what's it four okay so we get this part done and the next part is a another code example probably for open AI uh and open a it's like a perfect example I guarantee the first time it will fail because it is using some old documentation um so we want probably use structure output uh to categorize post um so I can basically do something similar so for this I can add a new composer or add doc open and structure output uh so this time I will say uh probably just paste something in help me build a simple uh type script uh script using open AI uh structured output to categorize subreddit for each category here and I can probably paste in the uh all the category that we defined earlier actually didn't allow me to categorize things public so I would just type it out when people asking uh for tools and solutions pin and anger when people expressing pinpoints and frustrations advice request asking for advice and resources money talk uh when people talking about spending money uh an airm should return result in format like categories solution request true false ping anger true false advice request true Force money talk and true force uh okay so this should uh should be pretty clear in ter and I try to include those kind of uh results as well so I can communicate clearly what is the exped result that I can include in document too quick ad break let me tell you about a business I invested in it's called boring marketing.com so a few years ago I met this group of people that were some of the best SEO experts in the world they were behind getting some of the biggest companies found on Google and the secret sauce is they've got a set of technology and AI that could help you outrank your competition so for my own businesses I wanted that I didn't want to have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I didn't want to depend on ads to drive customers to my businesses I wanted to rank high in Google that's why I like SEO and that's why I use boring marketing.com and that's why I invested in it they're so confident in their approach that they offer a 30-day Sprint with 100% money back guarantee who does that nowadays so check it out highly recommend boring marketing.com and this just always blows my mind that you're able just to access the billions of dollars that was SP on creating open AI in an instant for whatever application software that you want to create yeah it's pretty crazy um have you saw sound like what's like most interesting uh kind of application you saw people building with cursor did you see some people start launching a business already um you know I've seen a lot I've also seen you know bolt repet cursor you know it's starting it's really starting to get crazy I just had the CEO of repet on the Pod oh yeah I saw that that's he was you know people are like he was telling a story of how the SE like a teacher goes and like go starts building using repet and repet agent and all of a sudden like raises $20 million quits his job it's just it's insane yeah that's crazy because there's just so so many creativities when the barrier lower um that's awesome uh okay so this is like perfect example so even though I provide document add documents um it will just ignore the documents and then start using some old model and also not really using the structure output uh so this is where I would like start prompting it further uh probably even remove the documents uh so say you are not following the best practice uh below are the code exam Le so I will go to the documentation um I probably try to find a specific example uh that they have before and then putting here uh and uh a few problems I noticed that they have is like you need to update uh based on example above which are press say users. package for defining data structure and use the GPT 40 model and uh move the category description to Z Model description itself and uh make the prompt more generic not tied to specific categories and don't specify the Json output structure uh because I want to make it like later if we want to add new category uh then it'll be easier I was going to ask you about that uh you know that makes sense so it's when you're when you're doing stuff like this it's it's it's good not just to only think about what you're building today but how you know what it could look like is what you're saying yeah exactly exactly because now otherwise it'll be really difficult to kind of maintain uh if everything just impr prompt like that um and that's where like you also by earlier doing those spec and uh research you can align this a little bit earlier and easier uh because when you have like 10 different task later for agent uh it's very hard to align individually okay now you can see that updated um or just accept it uh now let's try to round this so I do npxs note um subredit categorizer dots okay uh curse of demo is haunting me today um let me adding this call this arrow and when you get bugs do you do you get frustrated like do you get a bad feeling in your stomach how should one feel when when you get bugs uh uh it I think yeah that's why I I definitely feel didn't feel good uh and hopefully some of them goes away later uh with the with a newer and newer model um but yeah it's hard and and that's why initially I want to kind of break that down I learn kind of learn lesson like it just keep getting Circle for even very simple problem when you're looking to the actual fix um yeah that's that's that's very frustrated um yeah like for example in this case uh it made a change but you can't see that clearly the change here is wrong um so I will probably just uh but but because actually integrated a pretty good feature recently I don't know if you saw that check out and this will allow you to kind of review that a bit better so I can't this time I'm going to give you a bit more instruction so every time when that situation happen like I will kind of try different ways to Pro either promp it uh like get it Sy step by step or give it a bit more instruction or additional documentation so I got Arrow above uh please help me fix it based on the code example here so um just copy paste again help me fix it I love when they're like I apologize for the confusion yeah yeah very patient programmer that you don't ever got in the real life okay so yeah it is using the right one but I'm going to change the model here let's try again um all right still got an arrow please help me fix it let sync step by step hopefully this work work goes away later once we put together documentations true I've never seen someone say let's think step by step why did you why did you write that uh that's because uh like n in previous large Range model uh this's a very common technique called Ching of s uh so basically once you get uh you kind of get it to switch geers um so when they try to uh it's like system one and system two syncing uh in the in the book kind of syncs fast and slow when you try to get it to do just everything at once and it often fail uh but when it break down into small steps it tend to have better result and that's what we kind of try to simulate here uh so once it try to think step step by step instead of give you like 2 plus 2 equal four it will try to think okay how do I break down into different steps so that often will Le to better results that's why I will kind of try to promp it for some kind of harder problems uh okay so this time I can see that it get results um and if I just try change this to be let's say I'm happy uh with my current project uh but want to uh how can I get my dog happier and if I track this hopefully the uh okay so this is not correct um but happier uh and I'm looking for there we go I'm looking for let's say uh a part that to feed the dog yeah there we go while I'm away okay so solution request is true so this is working and uh we're going to do the same thing I just uh going to uh include this as a second power code so documentation for how to categorize Reddit post using open AI structured [Music] output uh and the code example expected uh response so here include the expected response as well so it's it will know how to um put together with other features uh and I will also reference this here okay so that's pretty pretty good stting point um what I'm going to do next is actually uh I'm going to like set up project and put the file structure and actually get 01 model to help me uh fill in all the gaps I have I might have missed uh and to do that the first thing actually I want to set up project so I'm going to use chassen to set up project copy it why do you why do you choose Shaden like what do you like about it uh it looks good quite like the style and uh because they have a lot of wait uh sorry give me one oh sorry and to delete this package Json first uh because there are other like component library but uh not as like clean good coverage yeah yeah uh okay so redit Antics do you see other kind of uh UI component people use quite a bit yeah yeah but I think from in our world at least I'm just seeing the vast majority of people using Chad um CDM yeah yeah yeah and also another I think me read is because uh you if you use v0 then CH here kind of came out of as a default one so it's easier to maintain as well okay so now we set a project uh inside this project I will set up a folder called instructions uh and this is where I will uh firstly copy paste the draft over uh and uh I will probably also create a.v. loal just paste over the credential that we put in before um and next thing is I actually want to communicate the file structure because quite often uh cursor just don't know where to create each file and that's caused a lot of problem so you can use a package called a tree which will give you uh like the file structure fairly easily but our just do three level two which means it will only go down uh two level down I probably give oh sorry before that probably I would want to add some um UI component from chassan as well I put button input dialogue uh tabs table sheet uh card probably this ones will be needed uh and then I will do TR L2 and uh ignore node modules. kit so this were uh kind of exclude certain files that we don't care from the file structure and then it will return me this file structure that I can use to paste in here so then it will know better about where we are in ter of project setup uh so this a pretty pretty decent one uh but what I found is that when I just give this state to cursor it'll also have some Gap because there still a difference between the documents uh that product manager generated versus what engineer manager give to the engineers uh so what I often use is I will use this starting point then use uh like stronger model like 01 to help me fill in like getting them as a kind of engineer manager and start filling in the details interesting I never thought about that but that makes a lot of sense can you show us how you're going to show us how to do it yeah so in this specific case I would go to one model I would just paste in the whole like Doc we created so far and this kind of a standard prompt I normally will use uh so I firstly I wanted to generate the file structure um I just pting it then we will see so you can see that I pasted in the whole uh Doc and in the end uh I were ask to like above the project I want to build how should I structure my project file and that would give you a bunch of like common rules uh which is very similar to uh what I put in here in term of project setup uh it's basically give a bit more instruction like all new components should go to this folder uh page should go to this we are using nextjs this one uh then based on that uh over model first they try to propose okay this is like the final file like project structure or different components that we would need uh so it know what what towards and you can probably take a look here to see if this align with what you were thinking because sometimes you identify some kind of very clear mistake they might have repeat component folder twice things like that um but if this looks good U this the benefit of this one you can see is that it actually will spit up uh do a bit planning and architect project a little bit more uh and they try to also identify what kind of dependencies uh would be there as well uh and if I think this looks good then I can use the par how now help me adding all the details uh of the original PRD um and uh I don't need to create actual code just PRD and including file structure and documentation things like that and based on that it should be able to like create a very like detailed uh documentation uh that hopefully going to communicate the spec a lot better because now you can say like it will uh Define the functionality that a lot in a lot more details as well as the uh actual variables and file structures uh and additional requirements and as someone who's worked with engineers in the past this PRD Doc is like makes them light up right this is exactly what they want they don't want to see like here's two features I really want and I don't blame them right it's important to actually have a strong PRD if you want to have an end product that is is going to be super tight um and ultimately valuable to people exactly uh it also leave a lot less ambiguity as well um like one problem I think people often found is like if you are a new product manager uh you see people just keep delivering things that not exactly what you want um and this will hopefully take a lot a lot of guas work from the process um okay so this is pretty decent one uh and then the next thing is is that we can finally start getting cursor composer to start building this um and uh what I'll do is I'll probably do a submit so the project set up comit um and uh now I will try to get this to build the app so I open cursor composer um I'm building a Reddit Antics platform stre strictly based on this instruction now let's build uh this number one first uh so this is kind of one benefit of having doc because then you can break down into small tasks where it can have less room for Arrow so I would just ask it to implement the first part and it should be able to start creating components based on the like plan project structure and dependency it's happening it's happening and hopefully this will reduce amount of Errors you have all right let's see um mpm round def okay here you go so you can see the like as you can see the UI is bit off but as I mentioned I'm going to just ignore that for now so it has the cards to display the sub Rus if I click on that it will not do anything because this part hasn't been implemented yet uh but I will go back here and then give it some uh great uh now let's do the second part oh I see so you're just going one by one yeah exactly uh because I previously TR I found when I tried to create everything it first much like likely it's going to have ever out uh but also it will sometimes just skip some steps for some reason right yeah no it makes sense right cuz you're you know people talk about one-shotting it right oh I use this prompt and I built this app and you know it's like well then you have like a bunch of errors and it's going to make it way longer to you know I think the strategy what you're basically saying is it's kind of like crawl walk run you know step by step yeah exactly uh okay so I have a second one and if we open this you can see that the page that like structure is created as well and the next one I can get it to do great uh now let's do the S step make sure you refer to uh here I probably would just Bas on instruction uh based on instruction I again make sure you refer to uh the documentation at the bottom uh now if I go back and refresh page okay got some arrows and let me check if it has any arrows in the uh okay so this time those type of Errors is bit more kind of annoying because you don't really have a good way to communicate with cursor uh so so normally the first thing I would do is that I would just say uh it say uh please help me add debug info to the code uh so this probably normally First St I do just add it debug so I have a way to communicate B specific arrows to cursor so that it can actually figure out right fix right cuz you don't you don't know what's going on yeah because in this case it's very hard to communicate you can probably try your best to explain and uh probably still get the in uh get the solution wrong because it has so little information okay so if I go to here um um let me check if my credential is correct looks correct um and uh just uh going to copy paste those arrows got arrows above still fail to fetch and display redit post okay I just uh check again making sure it didn't mess up voice my credentials okay here you go so this time we can see the Reddit post has been displayed popularly um and now we can move to like the last step um great it works now let's uh P the last part by the way the thing with curser just for people building sometimes it's fast sometimes it's slow sometimes it's down yeah and and you know it's just be aware of that yeah it is um especially if you're using like uh more more like powerful model you can slow down a little bit yeah it's actually kind of crazy because they got so much traffic and uh volume past few months and it still keeps things going okay this another arrow um very likely so another good thing so errow out but good thing of that previous research is that I think we kind of know why because very likely the same reason it eror before it error again because I found the cursor or lary model generally is not great at uh getting the you can see that now it's gbd4 which don't have the support for the structure output if I try it again refresh okay here we go um so now you can see that all those redit posts has been categorized in different category like solution request pain anger and I can click on there to see the specific posts um so this is kind of like example of how can you build this one uh there more feature can build out but uh this is kind of the workflow I will use uh normally to like turn them into proper Doc and they can build step by step to get to a app that it's actually going to be used um but and this is probably the time I will start diving to the UI part as well so as example uh because the project functionality now has been built up uh to get UI right is actually going to be more predictable and easier because I can just go to let's say the homepage first uh and then go to VZ I will paste this in uh and then I will start ask it to like just make it better look better uh so this is kind of problem I nor sorry I build this app uh please keep the functionality exactly like above but make the UI a ton better um and uh I can also add some specific style that I want um so I probably prefer black and white uh maybe dark mode as well similar to verel really smart move to also put examples like similar style to versel um is a good T yeah yeah because I found otherwise it were interpret looks better in different ways do you found uh I Haven uh do you find like some other good prompts uh that you see from vzer from other guest so someone told me the other day and this is such an obvious thing to do but he was just like buy a bunch of books around design and I ordered like five books and just write like create prompts from the design books like go and go and get the best Amazon books for design and just and maybe I'll include some a couple of them in in the description people are interested um and then create prompts from them yeah right I see so it's like uh you literally put it as part of prompt uh for the books well it's like the problem with the reason why people can't get a lot out of EAS zero is cu frankly they don't have the language to understand what good good design is so the answer what's the answer the answer is to become well versed in design and how do you do that there are books about that sort of stuff so and then comment below I can also do a whole video on how to get the most from from vzero if people are interested that PR cool okay okay I just uh uh sorry this is a component for the separated card uh let me check did I do anything wrong here B component display if I go to the oh so pting the wrong thing earlier okay and you normally will get Arrow here but you can just ignore um paste in here okay so now you can see that the Styles start looking better uh but this is just like one example inside is still not as good but you can basically imagine we can just go component by component um but everything will just look a lot better um and uh because you already provide code and you can just prompt v0 to say follow structure and just update UI uh and you can see now the the the room for Arrow is a lot less if we do this um and we can probably do another uh but before I do that uh instead of updating updating the UI itself uh actually I'll probably just do one last part um so we can go to the separat this um update that as well to this play subredit page and is there while we are waiting for is there any kind of like startup idea on top of your mind that you are pretty Keen to start build out if you get time for cursor I have a uh a note a notes file where I just put startup ideas in I call it ideas I think everyone should have one most people who listen to the startup ideas podcast have one um it's literally just I'm not going to share it on screen because want everyone to take all these ideas but um I got a million I can give you a a few I'll give you I start with one IMDb for creators is one like imagine like IMDb like is a directory of you know you'll find people like uh Brad Pit there but you're not going to find Jason zoo and Greg Eisenberg on Am IMDb right yeah so what does the IMDb for creators look like all right and the people can just go there and find the right Niche topic they care about yeah I think it's like a way you know it's a directory of people who are creating content in different niches I think that whenever you know whenever someone is going diving into something new they want to find trusted interesting content creators so it's it's it's a directory of th of those people I think that would do really well that would be Co it sounds pretty straightforward for the curs of Debut so for sure and that's a good point right there's some ideas that are straightforward for cursor to do and there's some ideas that are not yeah exactly okay so now start adding some icons uh but yeah this is kind of example of how you can start using you you can probably keep prompting it to like get a better and better to more align with what you want um like how you get get a UI uh the last part um that I want to quickly showcase is like how can you use some modular reusable pump uh so one I can probably quickly showcase is that uh this uh let me try to find so this one prompt I uh quite often use for uh like setting UPS o um so I can so their function as I mentioned before is pretty standard um and it can be applied to all the other projects and this is kind of one example that uh this is Doc I kind of used before to create authentication and since they are kind of similar to every single project I just I can just paste them in uh and then start uh like Implement us feature um so as quick quick example I just uh going to paste in the credential so now I can add a new uh new composer and then say uh I've build a Reddit analytics platform based on this uh please oh actually I might even remove this stock now please help me build the uh authentication user o function strictly based on this setup o. MD um I've done step one and two already which is like set up oos and install libraries uh now let's build step three and step four so you just start like build out the uh sign page sign up page and again with best we kind of want to uh do step by step great now let's do uh step five and great now let's do step six it's kind of annoying that currently we have two Ste problem step by step to get good results um I hope like with new project like boat uh or others can just connect this workflow that people are manually doing there definitely Gap there I feel yeah it's for sure coming yeah uh okay so I do need to set up the package here okay so uh now if I go to a Subarus and if I haven't log in it will just log feature just there and this is kind of one modular prompt uh can be used for like other platform uh they're pretty standard and same thing you can imagine is like for payment and now if I log out it would so take me back um but you can imagine like if we have a collection of this type of standard feature prompt uh and can be shared across the community then I think this going to be extremely useful uh because then I can just like take this prompt and uh to let's say build a payment system uh but I also Imagine like later for those developer tools uh they might have a new ways for people to use it like instead of like R documents you might have a prompt that you can just take and start integrating into the uh inter your application um so yeah this is this the one thing I'm really excited like I really hope someone can build a aggregator if not I my start one as well uh to just for this modular prompt that people can share um um yeah so this is kind of a quick example of how can we build uh the my workflow in like building uh with cursor uh with again the firstly our star with spent a lot of upfront time to write specs to reduce uncertainty as much as possible and then build functionality first and UI later and most importantly later I think we can start aggregated this list of reusable prompt um which will speed up the M process a lot more hopefully this is amazing this is like the fundamentals of AI coding um I'm one of those people I'm guilty of this like I just love going into vzo starting there doing no specs no modular prompts just kind of like going you know following my curiosity and now that I've been doing this for you know almost eight eight weeks I guess of AI coding um it stings it stings you know it makes my job a lot harder so thank thank you for coming in and and and sharing this and uh I hope people listen to this and and and start and start doing AI coding this way because I think it's it's it's proven it works and um it is fun it's just it's a bit more structured than a lot of people are used to yeah exactly like if it's more like people's expectation like if you compare with a impression that you just give a prompt and everything just work out then it feels hard but you kind of want to compare with how damond was doing before H now it's actually a lot easier compare with the real dment um that's right it's kind of like one of those uh electric assisted bicycles um the ones that you still need to Pedal the wheels um and it just gives you a little boost um that's how I see this um and um Jason where could where could people get to know you better uh I know you have some awesome tutorials on YouTube as well yeah so um thanks for that so um I'm also running a um a YouTube channel called AI Json so you can like go to YouTube and search for AI Json I do Post interesting AI experiments that I do from time to time um to teach you how to build with AI and large Range model so feel free to search and check out out that's awesome yes yes go subscribe uh to Jason it's it's free to subscribe and then if you like this video uh and you hopefully want to see more of Jason on on this channel um the startup ideas Channel go like comment subscribe I hate that I have to say it but if you don't do that then uh you won't get the videos in your feed it won't remind you to uh to go and build your ideas and you'll just be one of those people that just sits on ideas and doesn't do them so uh Jason thanks again um and I'll see you around yeah thanks a lot later [Music]

Published: 2024-10-09 16:30:03 UTC
Description:
Join me as I chat with Romain Torres, Co-Founder of Arcads AI, as we discuss his frameworks and strategies for finding and building profitable AI Apps. Learn his step-by-step formula to building and growth hacking apps. 

Episode Timestamps
0:00 Intro
00:37 Introduction to AI Apps and User Acquisition
10:26 Product-Led Growth
13:17 ASO (Apple Search Optimization)
21:01 Organic Social Growth Hacks
33:38  Paid Ads Strategy
40:17 Creating Ads at Scale with AI Tools

1) Three main strategies to grow mobile apps:
• TikTok/Instagram organic growth
• Paid ads (FB, TikTok, Google)
• Apple Search Optimization (ASO)
• Each has its pros and cons.

2) ASO (Apple Search Optimization) 101:
• Find keywords with high volume, low competition
• Put keywords in app title
• Optimize app store page conversion rate
• Get reviews & high initial download velocity
• Pro tip: Use AppFigures to research keywords & opportunities

3) Organic social growth hack:
• Create native-looking content (not ads)
• Integrate app naturally into videos
• Post consistently across platforms
• Leverage micro-influencers for reach
• Example: Travel buddy app crushing it with wanderlust reels 

4) Paid ads strategy:
• Test THOUSANDS of ad variations
• Use AI to scale ad creation (tools like @ArcAdsAI)
• Iterate on winning formats
• Localize ads for different markets
• Key insight: AI makes testing 1000s of ads feasible for small teams

5) Case study: 17yo dev makes $400k/mo with AI calorie tracking app 
• Found trend on Reddit/TikTok
• Built simple AI-powered app
• Leveraged micro-influencers for organic growth
• Iterated on viral formats
• Lesson: Sometimes "overdone" ideas + AI + great marketing = $$$

6) Monetization hack: Niche down existing app ideas
• Examples:
a) Dating apps for specific demographics
b) Bible app for women
c) Plant identifier for specific countries
• Smaller audience, but higher conversion rates & less competition

7) AI is leveling the playing field:
• Easier to build MVP with ChatGPT
• Faster ad creation & testing
• Quick localization for global markets
• You don't need VC $ to compete with big players anymore!

8) Key takeaway: Success = Product-Market Fit + Execution
• Find proven demand (ASO, trends)
• Add AI "sizzle" to existing concepts
• Execute relentlessly on product & marketing
• Test, iterate, scale

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
so today I brought my friend Roman on and the reason I brought him on is he knows which a AI apps are popping why they're popping how to get users to these AI apps and just go through the ecosystem and some of the tools that were that you know Roman's using and uh I'm excited to have you man me too thank you for having me let's do it [Music] all right where do you want to start maybe let's maybe let's just start by opening uh what's it called tensorflow is that what it's called a center Tower censor Tower yeah okay and and yeah we can just start sharing your screen and and sort of walk people through the process of uh some other AI apps that are doing really well how much revenue they're bringing in and how they're acquiring users and I just you know my goal is really just to show people how how you think yeah all right let's do it have you seen this new verse app that was poing this week h a little bit tell tell me tell me more yeah so to me this up is like kind of interesting because I'm not sure I can even easily describe what it does uh and I feel so all seeing that but basically it's an app that transform a playlist like a Spotify playlist into something Visual and uh they do like kind of this like beautiful covers where you see uh kind of like a kid would have like designed uh his like wall in his house with a couple of posters and stuff like that and he does it from a link basically from a Spotify link and it recently popped up on on Tik Tok it was super viral and to me there are a lot of interesting insights from this one one like it's very hard to come up with like a way to like consistently come up with good ideas because this one is like so unique such a unique idea the second one is this app does something that is very that is very important when you are thinking about a new app ID is that they embedded the marketing flow inside the concept of the app itself so basically it's like when you create this like this wall with the app and I I don't even know how to call it I think they call it vision boards with the with the Spotify link then what to do next with it and the like the next step is basically to to share it with your friend either share it directly uh like through iMessage uh with the link and they did this very well done like invite flow where you can show um the exact app like the design that you have made and send it to your friends or even through Tik Tok because kids those days they create they are more and creating more and more content and they are on Tik Tok themselves and it's very easy to share those on Tik Tok so I think it's a very good example of like an app that from day one and they were released like early September like I was checking on on Sor Tower um the app just got released and they already got like millions of visitors on the website and it's just the beginning and yeah it shows how important it is to think about the marketing funnel when you do an app even before like building new features and building the products yeah I think it's a few a few interesting things about about that particular um app so one is I think it ended I think it got to like eight spot eight in the App Store so it's kind of crazy like how embedding a little AI virality into it could could get you in to chart so much so I think that was really interesting um I will say the other thing I think about about verse is it's a really hard product to build so there's two ways to to build AI apps one is you come up with like a completely new idea like they have and spend a lot of time thinking about a unique product um they have this canvas that I think is really cool um and it really is a beautiful product the other way to do it is and and which is what we're going to get deeper into during this episode is what are what are existing popular apps and then how do you kind of add an AI Sizzle to it um to capture that demand um yeah and it's way way easier to do that um however by the way I love doing number one too I'm not you know it's just today I think we're going to talk more about there's demand out there how do you capture that demand and kind of just add a little AI Sizzle to it 100% and actually I think it would be more relevant to talk about that but because that's exactly what I did in my previous company we did an inter intermittent fasting app like other app that were nothing re revolutionizing uh that already had a little bit of competition but we executed the product and the the grow very well and yeah so let's let's jump into it and uh share how you can embed AI to to do to do that and to grow faster um there are two things you need to nail when you do an app and it's the product like uh the onboarding flow the actual product after the pay wall and the gross and and in our previous company with mounder Dyan what we did is we clearly separated the role he was in charge of building a good product and I was in charge of growing the product and Sh don't tell anyone but I've got 30 plus startup ideas that could make you a millions and I'm giving them away for free these aren't just random guesses they're validated Concepts from entrepreneurs who built hundred million plus businesses I've compiled them into one simple database compiled from hundreds of conversations I've had on my podcast but the main thing is most of these ideas don't need a single investor some cost nothing to start I'm pretty much handing you a cheat sheet the idea bank is your startup shortcut just click below to get access your next cash flowing business is waiting for you yeah if you need those two things then you have a chance of like making a very profitable uh app and which is why it's such a beautiful business you don't need a big team to to grow that and I think AI can help you in both of those things like it can help you with the product development I've seen a ton of kids um learn how to code up with chat GPT and let's share my screen and show you one example of that they basically learn how to code in maybe three weeks or six weeks and build an app that was literally making millions of yearly revenue and then they use AI to to grow the app uh so let's let's share my screen and show you one example of that so the first app I had in mind is umax you probably have heard of this one already um and it's I think he is 21 22 years old it's a very smart kid who basically taught himself how to code with chat GPT and released the app and the app is super simple and actually it's by Design obviously because he didn't have the skill to make a complex app but it's actually something you are looking to do uh when you do this kind of app because you want the flow to be as straightforward as possible so people only have one thing to do in the app which is use the core feature and then proceed to the payment um so yeah this one is very interesting because they grew with Organic Tik Tok um so basically what it means is they developed the app and then they found very uh small creators to promote the app on Tik Tok Instagram and make viral videos so we can go into the details of that if you like that's one of the way you can grow a mobile app I I think there are three main ways to grow a mobile app the first one is like Tik Tok organic like these guys and I can show you a ton of other examples of people who did very well uh with this uh strategy the other method which is the one that we use in our previous company and that I'm going to show you a couple of example to who we which usually are the biggest companies in terms of like Revenue um are the paid ads strategy so basically you make an app and then you do very good ads for Facebook ads Tik Tok ads Google ads and the Third Way is Apple search so it's either ASO Apple search optimization or ASA which is Apple search ads and it's basically the search result when you type for a keyword in the App Store and it's also a very good way to to grow up and I can show you a couple of example example of that too yep and lastly yeah maybe one like one last strategy which is more of the ver strategy which is not the one I know the most but the strategy is basically virality like having embedded in the the flow like an invite flow that is very well done some people on Twitter like Nikita do this they are the masters of this I don't really Master this way of doing it but it's uh also and usually like they feed the product with initial traction through one of the three methods I told you and then it's like uh Catch the Fire uh Sol the fire for for the app to grow virally which is like something that is really beautiful to which happened to the verse app uh but yeah I think those are the three main ways what do you want to do do you want me to go through every single like examples for every single strategy 100% an example of every single strategy who's doing a well um and on the the last the last sort of piece to you said the product Le growth of viral you know the viral features I actually have a lot of experience there so I just want to tell you one quick story I think you'd find this interesting so my last company it was called islands and it was kind of like a Discord for college students and we wouldn't launch a new school we wouldn't launch a school until we had 5% of the school pre-signed up so we would do a lot of marketing to to get those 5% signed up and then what we do is we get you right before you like join the experience it would say keep University of Alabama safe invite at least three people to make it a secure and fun environment something like that and then the average person would invite 2.7 people or something um and then we'd go from 5% to 20% like kind of over you know very quickly um and that little piece allowed us to be way more efficient in our marketing so uh maybe it cost us $8,000 to get 5% but now all of a sudden it cost us $88,000 to get 20% so I think thinking about from from a product perspective how to uh it basically the way to think about product virality is it's basically a multiplier effect on your marketing so but yes let's let's go through your three things and then while PE while people are taking notes on these three three ways to grow it think about in your own app what is the multiplier effect that you can add to it because I 100% yeah and uh I mean I I even think with AI there there are opportunities for those viral app that needs like a very small niche of people like in a like in high school to install the app because now if let's say you want to like get the initial like the first 20 users like those one or two% it's very hard to get them even like uh even if you want to get those 20 users you maybe you need to go to the school like physically which is like can can be weird for a 30 years old to do that maybe you want to run a couple of ads but it's very hard to Target a specific audience like this but now with a you could like very easily do one ad specifically for carel Catholic High School and another ad for another very specific high school and in the hook of the ad that you do you will do hey you are Carl Catholic High School like did you hear about these new things that's happening and it's very hard to scale that if you don't use AI because you will need to have like influencers in every single school but with AI and we can like uh discuss that after but it's it's not possible to even Kickstart this strategy of like Varity um but let's start with the the ASO one I I mean ASO so Apple search optimization is basically the art of Being number one when people types a keyword word in the App Store it's very similar to search engine optimization uh but it's in the App Store basically and here the challenge is to find when you are thinking about new IDs is to find a keyword that doesn't have too much competition yet but has enough volume for people to rank on it and we actually did that in the past at the beginning of um with one of our apps that was like this keyword text to speech a lot of people were typing in the app store to find apps to like transform text into speech and there there was some web products like 11 Labs Etc but there were no product in the app store yet and for some reason people need an app to do that like for example if you want to clone your own voice it's easier to do it with a mobile phone than with a web product so we created an app that does that and it grew super quickly organically just with uh ASO and people searching for it I I I came across another interesting company that that does this exact strategy usually those companies are not huge because you are limited by the volume of um search in the App Store and uh you cannot do intent based marketing which is like showing an ad to someone who is scrolling Facebook and they didn't even know they need this app yet but you show them that they need the app in this case with ASO you are only looking for people who already are searching the keyword which is kind of limiting but it's very profitable so let me share my screen again and uh show you an example of that okay so the the name of the company is remone holding and even though they don't do a lot of Revenue it appears on tensor Tower I'm pretty sure they do much more than that because they the revenue number is capped to 5K on like like if you do less than 5K per month on an app it will just show less than 5K but addition if you addition all those apps they probably make more much more than 5K and um so they find those weird keywords like fan noise like some people search for that some people search for green noise some people search for anime girlfriend AI or noise noise cancelling apps and they are very good at at identifying keywords people are looking for but that don't have so much competition yet it looks like the the noise one was a heat for them because they have the broad Noise app the green Noise app the F fun Noise app and very often those Studio those mobile app Studios they repeat the same ID multiple time times like with the same technology but with a different keywall or different uh marketing um yeah so I will stop here maybe you want to comment something but that's one very interesting uh that uh I found in the upst so this is a this is a group of people I actually know who this is I think um they they aren't Reinventing anything right AI you know calorie count ERS exist already sleep sounds exist already green noise exist already what you're saying is they are looking at what people are searching on the App Store and capturing that Demand with a title probably that's a little more interesting than you know maybe what else is out there so for example there might be a lot of calorie count counters but there might not be a ton of AI calorie counters um there might be some sleeping sounds app names but there might not be a lot of green noise which is actually like a kind of a newer Trend so what they're doing is they're kind of looking at Trends and maybe adding some aess to it just because people are interested in the space and because of that and because they know how to rank which by the way is a whole other black box like got you know ASO is not my forte at all I'm not really sure like how to how to do it well um but they obviously know how to do it well because it's working yeah yeah 100% as you say they try to put the keyword in the title and then there are a ton of other techniques to do that uh I think a very good blog uh on this topic is the blog from App Figures it's a tool that lets you search keyword and identify new opportunities for new keywords and there are so many techniques like using the title obviously is a good one optimizing your conversion rate on the on the App Store when people visit the page so that they download and apple understand that it's like good traffic and that the app is relevant for them um optimizing the number of reviews the growth rate is important to uh there is also those minor techniques like when you launch a new app the the first day is actually very important because Apple gives you an initial boost on the keywords and look at looks at the conversion rate that you get on those on on on the app and if on during this initial boost you get a very high conversion rate on let's say you you launch a new AI calor counter app and people when they search for it and they see you up they download it then you will get like a flywheel a positive flywheel of downloads and it will keep staying High actually so the the launch is very important other techniques is like these people they sometimes do ads to not because they want to be very profitable on ads and optimize the ads but just because they want to have more reviews more traffic so that it creates this fly will of optimization for the for the rankings and um even though they still focus on the ranking they benefit from the traffic of the of the ads that makes sense yeah absolutely okay so that's ASO yeah and another one just to finish on this one that I think was interesting I think that was a key word that was put popping wall Pats Pilates and I see a lot of apps that start to rank on on these keyword so I just wanted to show you an example of a new opportunity I don't know how new and how good this opportunity is but that's an example of like something people identified and it's growing and they made an app for for and they use it in the the key so now uh the second one wait sorry just on that just on that it could be helpful for people to look at traditional Trend software Ware that isn't even specific to ASO um like for example Google Trends a HRS and see like what are the trends and then just going and searching on um I don't know what is that big there is one big ASO software tool I think uh we've talked about in the past maybe up figures or yeah um yeah yeah that might be up fig at you want looking yeah exactly and then also checking like an app figures to see um if it makes sense from an ASO standpoint so yeah just for people listening I think using traditional software totally Trend software Google Trends glimps um some of these trends that I've talked a lot about on the channel go ahead and use them write down your Trends write down your ideas and then go and and you can use like an app figures or something like that just to see how competitive uh uh it is from an ASO perspective 100% And that's a perfect transition to the next kind of like virality style um because research is one very good way to get ideas and lots of people get very good ideas from research on not on the App Store directly but on other uh websites and and by the way I I I did this simple thing that everyone can do which is I like created an automation that sends me every new app that ranks in the top of the App Store in each category and it's a pretty good indication of like something is popping off and maybe there is an opportunity because this app just joined the top of the App Store and it's quite new and it probably means that there is something there and you can do something similar but the one I wanted to talk about um newx that we already covered and I'm going to talk about other apps because I think you you have already covered this one and lots of people have covered it but it's interesting because they discovered about the ID because it was popping on Reddit and Tik Tok like the the looks maxing Trend which is like how to maximize how you look as a man was something that was a popping on Reddit and Tik Tok and that's how they got the idea of the app so it didn't come from the app storees they didn't see the keyword popping in the App Store it came from other software so 100% I think like using and that's what we did with the text to speech app like finding trends that are outside of the of the App Store uh but that are already proven to work on the web is a very good way to go like that was recently this sunno AI product which is creates AI song uh from text and a ton of apps have been created basically repli replicating this ID in an app using the apis ofso AI or other apis so yeah 100% that's a very good way to to spot a trending app I ID and um yeah another one so quick ad break let me tell you about a business I invested in it's called boring marketing.com so a few years ago I met this group of people that were some of the best SEO experts in the world they were behind getting some of the biggest companies found on Google and the secret sauce is they've got a set of technology and AI that could help you outrank your competition so for my own businesses I wanted that I didn't want to have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I didn't want to depend on ads to drive customers to my businesses I wanted to rank high in Google that's why I like SEO and that's why I use boring marketing.com and that's why I invested in it they're so confident in their approach that they offer a 30-day Sprint with 100% money back guarantee who does that nowadays so check it out highly recommend boring marketing.com another very interesting one I think it's quite small still uh but um it's an app that I've seen trending recently that is very smart about the organic marketing strategy so again that's the second strategy that I I've seen people do and it's basically about how do you manage to get free traffic basically from Tik Tok or Instagram reals or YouTube shorts B basically short videos platforms showing your product in a smart way that feels organic and that uh would get a lot of views and so this is basically an app to find people to travel wheels and I think it's over optimized in terms of monetization they are very good at acquiring users but the second part of like how do you monetize their app they could do much better and it could be much more profitable um but uh what they do is basically they do those reals on Instagram that are very native to the platform they they really don't look like ad they they just look like content you would watch on Instagram right traveling Dolphins beautiful people stuff like that that will just do very well on Instagram anyways and they include the app in the video so uh this one how can I find friends that I can do cool with is they put some music and then they show the app and they integrate it in a very smart and organic way and they just post again and again and again on their own account and they found a way like a repeatable way because they basically do the same video again and again again and they have a repeatable well way to have pics of downloads for the app and keep growing the app this way so I I think it's a a very interesting way to to to grow an app now do you think they you think they're paying people to promote some of these like in the early days at least like because now it's easy right because they've got 636,000 followers so now that obviously they're GNA po they know their content's going to work so when they post the real it's you know with a good probability chance they'll get hundreds of thousands of views but you think in the early days going zero to 100,000 do you think that they created content and we like you know some of these people here like hey you know in in these reals be like hey I'll give you $100 if you post it on your Instagram you think they did stuff like that yeah 100% uh that's uh what lots of these people do uh I mean sometimes they are very good at content themselves for for this specific case I don't know sometimes they AR very good at at at creating content and there is this guy who has an app parallel live uh he basically creates fake lives and when you when you open the app it looks like you are having hundreds of followers or thousands of followers in a live session and it's he does very good organic videos and he goes viral repeatedly and he's the one the founder is the one making the video the videos and there is like this dating app recently also a French app GG the CEO she she raised money with SEO and she has a team but she still creates content for her own Tik Tok and with her own face and is doing super well so sometimes they do post themselves because they AR very good at content but sometimes indeed they Outsource this to other existing creators um a cool example I've talked about recently on Twitter is like a young kid who created a calorie tracking app so AI calorie tracking app looks like a terrible ID that tons of people have done ready um this is really interesting yeah go talk us through this one cuz I think the scale of this one especially is is is pretty impressive yeah it's like it's crazy to me so the guy is 17 years old he created that's the I think the second app he creates the first one was an alarm clock uh from like people who wake you up like David Goins like wake you up to so motivated and he reached out to me and I was like very impressed by this ID and then he came back with another idea which is what the color tracking app and in my mind I found like don't do it that's the worst IDE ever like there are already a ton of calorie tracking apps like my fitness B that's own all the real estate for the ASO but he still did the app and he did amazingly well so let me show you the app so that name is k Ai and it looks like he's walking on the new app which we can see here uh he released a new app on September the 16th but yeah the app we are interested about here is the first one but watch closely the second one probably gonna do probably gonna even be more interesting right because like you know that he's gonna iterate on that and there's something here so wait sorry just looking at these numbers if I'm reading this correctly he's doing $400,000 of Revenue a month and he did 200,000 downloads last month exactly yeah that's crazy so the way you can research this one uh for the listeners who want to understand how they did it and I can quickly grow through it is basically to search on Instagram and Tik Tok in the search bar like stuff like um let's show them exactly how TR how they did it because I think a lot of people here are going to be inspired and they're going to think yeah I want to do something like that how you know especially if there's a 17-year-old kid doing something like this it definitely inspires 100% a lot of people all right so we are going to look at the Instagram and then with the looking to the Tik Tok so that's the Instagram account and in this case I'm pretty much confident that they didn't post most of the content most of the content was other small micro influencers who didn't necessarily have big audiences but the beauty of uh this channel Tik Tok organic Instagram organic is that now you can do a lot of it and get a lot of views without having so many followers because the platforms want to push the content and then they want to push creators to create more and more and you can get rewarded by the platform by just making very good content and so on this case I'm looking at the Instagram account because most of the time they like they are tagged in the in the videos or they post together so that's a good way to identify who posted those videos initially or to try to trace back the actual micro influencers they used um so they probably they found this guy and paid him to creates content like this super simple content gym content I understand and the goal of the video is one to understand how to go viral on Instagram or Tik Tok reals so how to make very good videos that even if you don't promotee it will get a lot of views but then you also want to integrate your app inside the video which is the hard part like basically you have to figure out a way to be very good at getting views but also be very good at converting those views into download and you don't even need to put a link or whatever most of the time people just close the app go to the App Store and search for the name of of the actual app uh the more organic you are the better it can do sometimes they don't even put the name of the app in the video and people find them in the comments um so that's the strategy now let's try to find um their videos on Tik Tok I'm looking on another screen call AI yeah again we see a lot of content from their account but also content from other accounts and this one might be interesting so basically they show so it's an app that you take a picture of your meal and it will tell tell you how many calories you have in it and I'm not sure if this is K actually or competitor but basically they probably do the same strategy uh they found this account and they probably paid them couple of hundreds bucks or couple of thousands of bucks and then the video did Super well organically so usually it's like being a VC right you invest in 10 startups nine will fail and one will pay for the dividends of all the other startups Tik Tok organic is kind of the same it's the lottery but the more you do it the more you understand what's going to go viral so you try to find a lot of creators try to have them post content hopefully one of these content will go viral and then you try to replicate the formula of what was going viral with these specific creators and makes sense right cuz if it if it's working organically probably going to work with PID behind it correct yes they they will also uh do some paid uh and uh we can talk about that too by the way of how to to gr and that's that's the founder so it looks like he create content himself in in this video so this guy is making like 300 or 400k per month with the calor tracking looks like he's at like his high outside as like high school you know he's like outside his high school just like filming $400,000 a month exactly he's tweeting all the time pictures of himself in the the the school class and telling about the teachers like telling him he shouldn't he should Len more funny to to watch um do you want me to grow through the the first strategy like the the the paay ads one yeah yeah I want to I want you to go through the first one um and and yeah how to how to use AI to to to sort of create some of these ads as well and that's a great place that we can end on amazing yeah perfect so let me think about a good example for for this one let's go to sensor Tower again and I think we could look at this uh Turkish company uh cway so they have a let's start with this one actually uh so this one is a plant identifier app and the name of the app is picture this uh they own multiple app apps including three or four plet identifier and this one is huge like with just one single app they make 7 million of Revenue per month so that's that's huge it looks like a very small Niche but uh they are making a ton of Revenue on this one is like almost 100 million Revenue per per year that they are making with with these apps and 90% of it comes from the first picture of these which by the way is the same strategy that we talked about with the c tracker which was uh before AI there were some plant identifier content apps which basically you know show your it was basically like a reference book digital around different plans and it helped you figure that out AI yeah exactly it really and some of them were popular now today that doesn't really make sense when you can integrate with you know G GPT anthropic some of these other llms they just took the same idea but just made it a lot more valuable so they've added AI to the app now of a sudden it's way more valuable uh your clickthrough rates are going up your you know on your ads on your organic on actually downloading your app so that's why you're starting to see like that's why you can build an app and by the way their release date is quite interesting right we didn't mention this but it says their release date was 2017 so they it's not like they launched this like yesterday um correct so they probably at you know my guess is they were doing not that much amount of Revenue up until like two years ago year and a half ago and then all of a sudden started to scale significantly because of um this you know evolution of of of AI adding AI to the app yeah it just made the product work right it just made it better and yeah as you say same for the calorie tracking apps there were I remember a lot of like apps where you can take a picture but they didn't just they just didn't work before AI so let's look at uh the ads so and now the thing I I I want to highlight here for these like plant identifier apps and I'm not sure even sure this is the same app or another one but uh they they iterate like create easy on ads like they don't just like do a couple of ads and see if it's profitable because most of the time it won't if you just like start training ads you do 10 ads and uh you get a lot of views a lot of downloads but to be profitable you did to be crazy about optimizing every single detail and this is what we did in our previous company that payad was our main channel to grow our apps and you are not doing like tens of ads every month you you are trying to do like thousands of ads every month to find profitability because you need to find the perfect angle to promote the product and as you can see here they tested like 30,000 videos which is like an enormous number of creatives to test and again in the same way as now they can do this product and now it works with AI That's pretty much the same thing for marketing they can now test 30,000 ads the only kind of teams were able to do that in the past like maybe five years ago or three years ago even two years ago before AI basically were the gaming Studios like if you look at uh companies like Candy Crush um or uh companies like King and uh companies like that they they were already testing a ton of ads before AI because you only needed a computer to to promote your product you basically need to get some screen record of the game and maybe add some text over on top of it and this was uh possible without AI even though now ai makes it even easier but the opportunity I see here for mobile apps is that now with AI you can do the same strategy that they did in gaming which is you create all of your ads from a computer you you you basically think about like the ad and you don't need to hire an actor you don't need to talk to anyone to make it happen you can do everything thing with like a tool like Arad which is my company that I'm doing now or uh just text to speech with tools like 11 labs and then using a video editing tool that everyone can use like even a seven years old can use now and piece like match the pieces together uh to to make a very good ad so do you want me to quickly grow through how to make those actual ads or maybe another example of yeah companies like that that would be great how to make one of these ads I think your point is really interesting which is uh you need to make hundreds if not thousands of ads in order to find the formats that's going to be working but in the past that would be extremely costly and today it's not that costly um because of AI exactly exactly and that's that's what led us to to to create arets because we really loved making gaps and it was very profitable business but now this we saw this opportunity as even bigger because now all of those app Studios and we are actually not working only with apps obviously but all of those companies they they are looking for ways to scale the creation of ads and AI makes it like 10 times faster and 10 times easier to create uh ads at scale so maybe let me share my screen and we are going to go to Arch ads which is uh the tool we created to to help people do that so it's quite simple so basically the way it works is you have this white empty box right here where you write your script so let's say you want to promote a plant identifier app you would say something like hey I always have issue like finding the best plant and maybe you want to try this ID and you would write a script so basically you will type uh a script right here and then you would go through a library of hundreds of factors so you would have people in every situation every age every demographics so I don't know if you are doing a calor tracking app maybe you want to select people in the gym and generate a video of of someone in the gym so maybe we can look at preview here and so you can select one or multiple actors click next maybe listen to the preview of how they speak click generate and just like that in a couple of minutes you will get your video that will uh basically match the script that you wrote right here and it will look something like that and now if you want to promote your app and try 20 different angle in one day it just takes you like maybe an hour to find figure out 20 ways to promote the app and generate the 20 videos and maybe then put them into an editing tool and add some screenshot of the app remove the background behind the actor which can now be done with one click with AI again uh and just m make 20 final ads that you can test today and you will see that one of them will do like two times better than the other ones and then that's the starting point for you to iterate and to make a lot of different angles different variations until you find the one that is winning for you what about different languages like can you use something like Arc ads and and you know do an ad in French for example 100% yes uh that's what uh I'm going to show you maybe a last example of that but that's the next step to scale so if you are just starting out obviously I would recommend starting on the in the US because not only the market is bigger but the conversion rate for subscription apps is much higher in the US people tend to pay much more uh for for for these apps so the step one is to make it work in your initial Market but step two then once you have done that and you kind of hit sailing in terms of like how many people you can reach is to basically do the same thing take the ads that are working in the US and localize them in every single country uh this company is very interesting so one of our clients for Arad and they do a ton of AI ads and they are this is Turkish Studio they make 8 million of monthly uh Revenue with a ton of apps like cleanup phone storage cleaner like again as you said IDs that are not very new and I think sometimes they acquire existing apps um sometimes ideas that AR quite new like the AI tutor Mass helper or AI art generator and then they use AI to do a ton of ads uh to iterate on not only the angles as we just saw before but also the languages trying to do the same ad in Spanish rench and every single location where there is opportunity yeah I think so this is super cool first of all like it opens my eyes to just like this random Turkish company with no probably Silicon Valley backing is like making hundred million dollar plus a year using this strategy so this is really really interesting I think the I agree with you starting in the US generally is a good idea but it is it is more competitive and there isn't opportunity to just take some of you know some of these plant identifier for example apps and just win on ads for different countries um and localize the app basically um and so I think there's a h there's that's a huge like there's a hundred ideas 100 startup ideas just from that um so I'm happy that yeah I'm happy follow ASO you like localize the app and rank better on search which is something that some people might not bother doing because like they don't care about adding an additional 20K or 50k of monthly Revenue but maybe you do and then that's a cool opportunity yeah you can even do like plant AI for Canadians plant AI for Turkish people you know like just putting that as like this is an app for Canadians you know um for example and maybe the logo is like a Canadian flag and the ads are all Canadian and not you know Canada is maybe not the best example because Canadians are so close to the US but like maybe and and they mostly speak English but maybe a a Brazil app or or something like that yeah 100% I've seen so many people do well and actually we did like we did a weight loss up for women it was like our approach to like niching down to one specific audience and an existing app is also a very cool strategy I've seen so many examples of that um you know the company behind Tinder they own multiple apps like dating apps for Latinos dating apps for gay people and it's basically the same app wrapped for different niches and that's such a very good way to PR and I even saw one that was pretty interesting recently so there is this Bible chat app that was like basically an app that wrapped um the Bible and you can talk with it through like a CH GPT like interface and it was doing super well they do a ton of ads and they do very well but then new apps in the the space started to pop out and um one of those was Bible for women that is constantly in the top of the app store which looks like a weird Niche but um again yeah this idea as you say like taking a appp that is working and proven to work and niching it down to either a country or um a specific audience is often a good idea love it Roman thanks for hopping on and giving us a master class around how to come up with app ideas how to think about uh adding AI to our apps the three different marketing playbooks for some of these apps and and how to create AI assisted ads so appreciate you coming on where could people learn more about you've got these amazing breakdowns on Twitter um for some of these app Studios where where could people go and find you yeah so uh arc. a if you want to run some ads uh Twitter uh you can look for Romain from arcad and you will find me on Twitter and I try to break up cool like apps that are pupping and uh yeah that was uh that was great thank you for having me of course all right my man I'll catch you later awesome yeah

people are saying that bolt this new tool is replacing cursor AI they're saying it's easier they're saying non technical people could use this and create a prototype in 20 minutes or less even easier than cursor AI we dive into it I brought my main man Ross Mike on the Pod he explains things so simply uh for anyone who wants to build their ideas this pod is for you [Music] all right let's make some history so we've got Ross Mike Mickey Michael back on the show he's here to talk about bolt and you know they say it's a cursor killer they say it's a VZ zero killer uh what what are what are people going to get out of this video if they if they make it through yeah think well again first and foremost thank you for having me here it's it's always a pleasure and I I never want to take it for granted so thank you so much for that Greg but in terms of what bolt Z bolt new seems to be is I think it's looking like a a culmination of all the different tools people have been playing with all placed into one and although it's it's early it recently just launched a couple days ago um you cannot deny whether you're a developer non-developer that this thing has potential there's been some issues some bugs people have been experiencing but again this just launched and from my first few plays and attempts this this is mind-blowing and I think no better way to you know test it out than to build something I think that's right yeah and through that process through the building people can learn and write some notes I don't know what do you want people to do while they're listening honestly to me it's just like I hope it's just an encouragement to just keep playing with these tools right I don't think I'm confident to say any of them is perfect but at some point they will be or they'll get really really really really really good and you've put in the groundwork to keep testing iterating playing Breaking learning that when they do become really really good you're not starting from scratch you've already have this knowledge now you're starting to build and ship fast that's that's that's my goal if this encourages you to play after work late at night instead of watching a show and you're just on bolt or some other AI tool then that's a win all right let me share my screen and to preface don't really have a project planned but I was just thinking there is this um company called uh foul. and basically what they do is they're an aggregator of all the different um image um AI models and they turn them to simple API so let's say for example a simple text to image AI model like flux I can click on this and they basically what they do is they take these models they wrap them through their with their API and they make it so that with this one snippet of code I can use their AI model and have access to it for some reason this is not working no it is so if I click run on this this is an image model and the prompt is extremely close up single tiger eye direct blah blah blah blah blah and you get this let's do something different let's do two dudes on a podcast virtually talking about AI let's see what we get hopefully nothing weird yeah I'm scared you know what it's pretty it's pretty good so what we're what we're going to do is we're going to use their API and build uh a website that you can enter a text prompt to and it'll give you an image and we're going to use Bolt uh with the best of our ability so what how does that sound GRE is that a good should we go with that let's do it perfect okay so what I'm going to do is I'm going to start with bolt and I know that for a project like this it's probably best I use something like nextjs so what I'm going to do is I want to build a simple SAS um project using nextjs can you please just build a simple landing page make sure you're using next js14 best practices so with v0 if you guys remember the last VI uh video I was talking about v0 is owned by versel which is one of the maintainers of nextjs so when you use v0 by default it's going to use nextjs bolt on the other hand is is is not owned by uh versel so I specify with both that I wanted to use nextjs just because it's a framework I'm familiar with and it's uh one of the most popular Frameworks to build web applications with so I hit that prompt and now what I like about bolt is I'm not just getting the code for a single file it's building on my project it's building on my layouts it's building out my landing page it's installing the packages which is the biggest thing right when you set up a framework or a code basee sometimes you're going to need external packages to do you know different functionality bolt installs those packages for you which is a great thing and might I add this landing page is pretty good as a starter base so we have our landing page now what I'm going to do is I'm going to take I'm going to go on flux and again this is the AI model we want to use I'm going to scroll on the documentation and there's a couple things it tells me here right so it says I I need to call call the API first I need to install this package I need to get an API key and then I need to use this code and then it has more instruction down line so I'm going to just follow the instructions and say and install this right here so let me take this package or actually let's say I this is my developer mind talking I don't even want to do that I want to say I want to build a text to image AI application I'm going to use file. a um what should I do and the reason I want to prompt this is I already used file dot before so I know how it works and I don't want to cheat and just copy code and do it like I'm a developer I want to use the a model so let's see what happens shh don't tell anyone but I've got 30 plus start up ideas that could make you millions and I'm giving them away for free these aren't just random guesses they're validated Concepts from entrepreneurs who built hundred million plus businesses I've compiled them into one simple database compiled from hundreds of conversations I've had on my podcast but the main thing is most of these ideas don't need a single investor some cost nothing to start I'm pretty much handing you a cheat sheet the idea bank is your startup shortcut just click below to get access your next cash flowing business is waiting for you uh so it bugged it does this sometimes you just hit send again it's pretty quick I will say yeah and you you you you know what for a first iteration this is great like I remember v0 when it first launched it was pretty bad like and and like anyone who was a developer you is a developer using it was it was terrible um but like you know two three months in it's one of the best ones out there so I have no doubt the same thing with bolt and this being their first version is is fantastic so let's see what it did so it says it up updated package.json it created some stuff so let's look at the preview so I'm going to refresh here let's see what happened um let me lower my screen here okay so we're going to go to code oh it's still downloading some package one thing I will say about bolt is because everything is online it is a bit slower so you will have to be a bit more patient with it so let's see preview let's refresh okay it broke okay so I know why it broke but I would love for the AI to fix itself it's not showing me anything please fix so okay this issue pops up but I already prompted that this should that it should try to fix itself let's see what it does the one thing about bolt I would say Greg is it's a little slow that's the only thing but um in my opinion I think that will not be an issue because with how great the product is I don't know if they have funding or they'll get funding they'll probably get funding in scale servers that shouldn't be an issue at all to be honest I feel like there's just a lot of people trying it out right now yeah that too that too and like it's uh okay so all right so I got this error what I'm going to do is I'm going to copy this and I'm going to say here's and error I got please fix this now I I know how to fix this but I I want the AI model to fix it and push comes to shove if it doesn't I will yeah there's so many people using it if it's this slow my goodness dude you remember you remember cursor initially it was so slow yeah and then they got that $60 million injection and then it became fast all of a sudden so I guess that's what bolt is maybe waiting for yeah okay let's see if this fixes it it's running the code okay perfect so it fixed my issue a little buggy a little shaky but if you copy the error that it's giving you and you tell it here's the error I got please fix it it looked like it worked so now what I'm going to do is I'm just going to type something random uh a handsome man if I click gener nothing's going to happen cuz nothing's supposed to happen we just have the layout so now what I'm going to say is um how do I make the text generation work using fou so what I'm prompting is I want it to kind of tell me what I need to do because it needs an external API key so what it saying is certainly let's implement the text generation functionality we'll need to set up a file. a client create a form for user input and handle the image generation process here's how we can do it so it's Pro providing me a step by step what's going to do and if we look at the API remember here it says install the client so that's exactly what bolt is doing now it tells me here I made the following changes it tells me what it did but here's the work I need to do it says to make this work replace your your file key here in EnV local for file with the actual uh API key so if I go on my code it's telling me there's a file called EnV and Vis short for environment. local so if I go on my codebase I see that there's a file right here so it's telling me this key right here this your file uh key here needs to be a key that I get from fou and basically how I would do that is I'd go on my profile and pull that key I'm just going to move this right here get my key real quick so that nobody cuz I'm using a live account all right I don't mind sharing this screen here so just for anybody looking the way you'd get your API Keys is you'd go on API keys I created mine and I'm going to paste this here you're going to see it but I'll delete it anyone who tries to spam it please don't um and I'll save it so it'll tell me that's what I need to do and it also says make sure you have the latest version of file AI server client um and what I can do is I can run this command myself s but I think it already did that for me so I'm not going to do that so I'm just going to hit refresh real quick and let's see if this works uh futuristic city with um uh Chick-fil-A I don't know why I would do that but okay so it says an error occurred while image generating let's go to our terminal and basically what I'm going to do is I'm going to copy the error it gives me here because I'm again I'm not a developer so I don't know what's going on so I'm just going to paste this error and say fix this for me again I know the issue but I just want to give people sort of a workflow to play with if it breaks like if this if you get an error here you go to code you look at the janky text you get here copy paste it over here say it's not working and then let it give you a fix so let's see if okay things look good it said preview um uh futuristic city with Chick-fil-A that'll be our prompt is the Chick-fil-A gonna be in there that's let's let's see how advanced okay so for some reason this broke again let's see why um so what I'm going to do is again I know the fix GRE but I want to just show people that if you handle it with enough grit and you keep on going it should be fine so let me just paste that one more time so I can get the error so can [Music] fail and then it failed so what I'm going to do is I'm going to copy this error all this red that I get right here paste it here and be like fix this error but what I'll also do is when I go to foul and if you guys remember when I went to the model itself I think it was this one and I clicked on API there was some code snippet it gave me so what I'm going to do is I'm going to say fix this error here's an example from files docs because again you can't always assume the AI knows everything and this is where um I know we just jump straight into bolt but if I want to build an actual application I would do research first on what I need how it would work how it works what the set up looks like but here we're just trying to have fun and show both so I would have done enough research on foul to know how it works what's needed what's not um and then with that information I'd give it to the AI model and it would probably not make the mistakes it makes now so let's hope this time this works it worked it worked I didn't think it would it worked Chick-fil-A though I don't see Chick-fil-A yeah wait wait wait wait see the chickfila I don't see the Chick-fil-A either or a modern Chick-fil-A chick wait am I spelling it right chickfila wait that's not how I mean I think you might I think you might need to put there's like dashes yeah we'll do that a modern Chick-fil-A in 20 567 so okay I would I would honestly say that that wasn't bad in terms of like I mean this image is terrible but in terms of the workflow I think Greg you you can see that yeah it has like there's some you know bugs that they the team I know is working on fixing but for the most part again if you have GD and you just keep on pressing giving it the air telling it to fix it I mean we did this in what maybe less than 20 minutes yep crazy right and what's cool about this is and this is what I love about um what you would call it bolt is I could click on deploy here and they partnered up with a platform called netlify and it's literally oneclick deployment so I just clicked the deploy button it's going to build my application check if there are any errors or any issues it needs to fix before deploying my application and then once the build like once it's compiled the code and the build is good and my application is ready for production it will literally deploy it to netlify and give me a URL that I could share so let's and nlii you could you know is awesome it's super reliable right it's not just any one it's one of the best out there it's not your you know toy like it's a dude in his room with five servers so it says there's an error here what we're going to do is we're going to say fix this problem because I don't even know what the issue is nor do I want to look at it and yeah netfi is a great deployment platform there are I mean if we go on their site there are pretty netlify I promise I don't watch Netflix if we yeah so like there are big companies that use netlify um so it's it's a great partnership um on both uh and let's see okay it failed again which is fantastic let's see why so what I'm going to do is I'm going to say the build keeps on failing can you please fix it and let's see on the code tab what errors there are I'm going to do let's see I'm going to okay I know what the error is but I'm not going to cheat I'm just going to copy this and paste this here and say this is the error I'm getting I paste that and let's see if it fixes it I apologize for the for oversight such a nice model and like what do you prefer are you a cursor guy are you a bolt guy now um you know what I am still a cursor guy for the simple fact that I enjoy programming I enjoy coding like this sort of robs me of the fun uh but I do like bolt maybe for quick Proto protyping like if I wanted to let's say work on an app um and I needed like a quick prototype just to see like just just to like visualize how things would work I would just prompt engineer it through bolt but the reason why I think I personally like cursor it it allows me to code but I also have my junior engineer with me uh bolt and repet they seem like they're taking they're taking the wheel right with cursor uh you're sort of still in charge right um and and and it's two different tools right I definitely do think bolt and repet are on one side of the spectrum and then you have um like cursor and v0 on another side let's see what error I'm getting because it's giving me another error it says cannot find a module so I'm just going to copy this and say fix this error so I guess it really depends on what you're looking for 100% I if I were like so I'll give you my take if I'm a non- teie um like a non- technical person I'm a Founder I want to start a startup or I just I'm just a builder a business person I would focus a lot on Bolt And replit if you are someone who wants to know more of the nitty-gritty then I would also use cursor right but if you're someone who just wants to instant prototype um you know see like you know see stuff like build a simple POC then bolt and repet are great but if you're I I truly believe you're trying to build something um that you uh that you want users to use you're going to have to get your hands dirty let's see if it yeah see it keeps have so it keeps uh now it's having a type issue so what I'm going to do is again this is where um the B team needs some improvements to make so I'm just going to say fix this problem but the one thing that I would say especially for non-tech non-technical person if I was non-technical I would rather deal with this than trying to figure out how to deploy something and this is why you're you know repet and bolt for non-technical people in my opinion are the clear winner just have to enter again when it poops like that because it handles the end to endend right versus with cursor like you can build something but deployment is a whole different animal in it of itself okay so let's see if if it's I think it fixed that issue I get so nervous totally like please get it right even though I know the issue and I can fix it myself we believe you we believe you I appreciate that thank you oh broke again what is it this time Dr off okay so I can literally fix it with one line and I'm going to do it but let's see check validity okay so maybe let's do a little learning here it says type error cannot find module V or its corresponding type declaration and then it says import drawer and then you see VA so basically what this is saying is um it can't find V and V is used for whatever this file is but when I look at my codebase let's run this code base again when I look at my code base um let give it a second to load yeah when I look at my code base it doesn't need a drawer so I don't even know why that file exists so what I'm going to say is I'm going to copy this uh let me just copy this right here I keep getting I I got this error I don't seem to be using drawer so please remove it and remove any other files or folders I'm not using and run this build so this is where like on Twitter I've been getting some responses people are like ah but like it's sort of buggy this is stand the third this is where like when it comes to deploying it because you need to make sure that all your packages and all your files are good that it bugs out on deployment but if if the way these companies build and grow is any indication of how Bol will be I have no doubt by within the next week this issue should be solved so okay it's going to build again 17th time is the charm it's okay this is this is the real the real deal right like we we're sharing it warts and all 100% so it okay so I'm going to cheat and I'm going to make this work myself so it says here cannot find module rad xui so I'm going to do is I'm just going to copy this basically saying there's this module it needs but it hasn't downloaded so I'm just going to download it manually and couldn't you go to let's say clode or something like that and just be like here's my issue I could the one thing is I don't know if I can download my codebase now what would be sick is if they allowed me to download my code base right and I could run this through cursor like can I I don't think there's an option like can I tell it can I download the code base like if I could download this code base then that would be a sick way to build like if I could download this code run it through cursor fix my issues and then place it back here um it says oh I have to use their editor I I don't want to do that so let's just let me just cheat right now and make sure everything's installed and then let's do a build myself so this is where the tough part with bolt is is the deployment part is a little finicky when you have external packages uh but other than that I mean in 20 minutes we had uh well it's building right now but we had a working prototype in 20 minutes um and that's just great in my opinion not just any working prototype like this is this is valuable stuff right like it's super super valuable I think if you have an audience and you know you can build your ideas here and distribute to your audience or do meta ads build you know just Arbitrage there like there's a lot of opportun to build build I actually have a question for you Greg what does like with all these AI tools what do you think someone who's maybe not so technical but is learning to be technical learning these tools what's the best positioning for them like what are they to do with thisinformation like let's say they know how to Market they know the business side and now they're getting into prototyping what should they be doing because this is actually a question for myself to someone who knows how to build like what you know let's say I I I have I I have this skill what should I be doing what should people um who know how to use these tools be doing quick ad break let me tell you about a business I invested in it's called boring marketing.com so a few years ago I met this group of people that were some of the best SEO experts in the world they were behind getting some of the biggest companies found on Google and the secret sauce is they've got a set of technology and AI that could help you outrank your competition so for my own businesses I wanted that I didn't want to have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I didn't want to depend on ads to drive customers to my businesses I wanted to rank high in Google that's why I like SEO and that's why I use boring marketing.com and that's why I invested in it they're so confident in their approach that they offer a 30-day Sprint with 100% money back guarantee who does that nowadays so check it out highly recommend boring marketing.com I mean just because you know how to build a product doesn't mean you know how to build a product that retains and drives engagement and word of mouth so those that's a whole separate ability of product optimization that cursor or bolt or whoever or whatever isn't going to help you do um that requires you to speak to your customers speak to users understand what they like understand what they don't like you you know go on social platforms like Reddit and and understand people's pain points add this feature here add that feature there but I still think that the number one way to learn that is by like being in the arena putting out the product and and committing to optimizing just like you're committing to building right and you're committ like this is what I want people to to really get from a lot of the tutorials I do is if you could commit to building and you could commit to learning commit to learning how to build commit to learning how to Market commit to learning how to optimize like that that's the future makes sense makes sense and I guess maybe a self selfish question for the devs I I know a lot of devs um that are very talented that could build great products like without AI but don't have a lick of understanding of how it comes when it comes to marketing It sharing it promoting it and all that stuff and what would you say for the devs who know how to cope but don't know the other side is it should they partner up with people or is it a skill that can be learned my message to them would be the best songs aren't on the Billboard 100 meaning just because you create the best possible product doesn't mean that you're going to be successful so just like how people like you will come on a pod and be like you should learn how to code and go and build stuff and like your training wheels are bolt and then move to cursor and then maybe like a you know a real ID I don't know um the same is true to devs devs should start by putting out content seeing what works uh building a community themselves seeing what works and and commit to the process so like if I'm someone like you like I'm like you're doing it you're putting out content you've got a great YouTube channel and stuff like that but um committing even even more you know what does that look like that makes sense I and I think a lot of uh a lot of people are especially devs are afraid of the content piece but while you were uh giving us some great advice I was trying to make this work and I think this is where yeah both just needs to fix so the issue is that it installed a bunch of files and dependencies that I'm probably not going to use and in order for me to make it work I would have to go line by line so what I would say for now is we have this amazing prototype randev and we're just going to wait a couple days for both to fix this but in terms of iterating building um right in this moment I think Bolt's one of the best it minus the bugs that like we just experienced right now cool anything else you want to let let people know yeah I would say just keep playing with the tools keep update with the tools um like I said in my first video um it it's really just taking part right like if you knew bolt released like two three days ago then that means you're you're doing the right thing and I would just explore and learn these new tools just because a new tool drop doesn't mean you have to use it uh but I think the more you play with it the more you learn the the more you start to develop a workflow and just a simple fact that with a couple prompts I didn't write any code with a couple prompts we build something where I can say two guys on a podcast talking about AI again this was just a couple promps I didn't write any code I gave it some documentation and we could do this right um obviously there's a lot more uh to building a full-fledged application and I know that's something we plan on doing uh Greg but for now this is bolt. new and I hope everyone has fun playing with it absolutely comment like subscribe if you want more Bolt videos from us M Mike uh has an incredible YouTube channel Ross Mike go and subscribe there um and uh anywhere anywhere else you want people to go yeah YouTube's fine um Twitter is Ross Mickey um and yep say hi and if you have any questions leave them in the comments below um I tried to respond to every single comment on the last YouTube channel at some point it would have been a full-time job so I'll try my best if you have any questions leave them in the comments below and Greg as always thank you so much for the opportunity thank you I really appreciate it later [Music] baby

Title: The Content Format That Will Make You Rich in 2025 with Samir from "Colin and Samir"
Published: 2024-10-07 17:07:15 UTC
Description:
Join me as I chat with Samir Chaudry, Co-Founder of Colin and Samir, we dive deep into the evolving landscape of content creation, technology, and the future of media. 

Timestamps: 
00:00 Intro
01:07 AR glasses
10:23 The future of Content in an attention economy
15:02 Samir’s Youtube and content strategy
21:38 Content Formats
29:43 Why it’s hard to standout on Youtube
33:45 Samir’s thoughts on Monetization
45:08 VR vs. AR
50:22 Creators should build software
56:46 Advice from Tim Ferris

1) AR glasses: The next big thing? 
•  Meta's Orion AR glasses left a big impression. Samir thinks they could replace smartphones... but not as soon as Zuckerberg predicts.
•  Greg’s timeline: 2035-2040 for mainstream adoption. Start experimenting NOW.

2) Content creation is evolving FAST 
• YouTube's push for connected TV means:
• 30+ minute videos
• Organized into series
• Netflix-like UI

3) The "Exit Velocity" problem 
• On YouTube, if 70% of viewers are still watching after 5 minutes, you're CRUSHING IT.
• Reality check: Audience retention is harder than ever. Hook them FAST or lose them forever.

4) Monetization strategy: Value Prop Extension 
• Don't just chase any sponsorship. Ask:
• What's my core value proposition?
• Which brands align with that mission?
• How can I extend that value to my audience?
Authenticity = $$$

5) The future might value INEFFICIENCY 🤯
• As AI makes everything hyper-efficient, there will be a premium on verifiably human experiences.
• Example: Paying $$$ for a live concert vs. streaming for free.

6) Events are the next big opportunity for creators 🎉
• Build community
• Create unforgettable experiences
• Solve the "loneliness problem" for your audience

7) VR vs. AR: Place your bets 
• Samir's not sold on VR. He believes AR/mixed reality has a brighter future.
• Why? People still want to be part of the real world, not fully immersed.

8) The creator's dilemma: Opportunity rich, time poor 
• Biggest challenge? Finding operators who can maintain quality as you scale.
• Lesson: Your content is still your #1 product. Everything else comes second.

9) Final wisdom from Tim Ferris
•  Separate the rewards of podcasting:
a) The conversation itself
b) The performance/results
• Enjoy the process, not just the metrics!

and the goal of a YouTube Creator uh which is also probably the goal of any startup founder is to identify what the audience is reacting to and then double down in that direction how do you know if you have product Market fit if you're asking yourself do I have product Market fit you probably don't have product Market fit and I think familiarity is a metric that is incredibly important in in the world that we are moving in in a world where we have an abundance of choice familiarity is going to win the reality is today for Content format are not defensible uh personality and perspective is uh and and I think that's like the most important thing that everyone can do to position themselves for the future again if you look at where YouTube is heading even with their announcements that made on YouTube two weeks ago like the you can you can gather that they are heading in the direction of more and more connected TV viewership and you look at that it looks just like Netflix so what the platform is is essentially signaling signaling to all creators is [Music] start yeah excited excited to jam excited to have you here um what I wanted to talk to you about today is is a little bit what I think is on your mind I know you recently were at Google HQ little birdie told me you were talking to Mark Zuckerberg during the you know Facebook Orion or meta Orion demo you know to me when I think think of entertainment and kind of like New Media you're you're my first call and I just want to know what like what's going on in your brain around where things are going because I think a lot of people are going to come up with ideas based on where you're going so yeah well um yeah it's it's a weird like it's always weird to go to uh companies as they like are announcing their new products right because you can't you have to take a step back and go like how much of this is practical how much of this is uh conceptual um like The Meta Orion glasses I think are a really great example if you think about wearables um do you remember Google Glass like trying Google Glass for the first time I do you know that that was probably 10 years ago um and this this like exploration of like whoa is this the future we're all going to be wearing these glasses and and we look like 10 years down the line and we're we're still here where like not everyone is wearing glasses but wearable tech is more popular now right like like watches are more popular rings are more popular wristbands um and so it is moving in that direction I think the Rayband metas are like the most compelling wearable I've ever seen and maybe the most compelling piece of tech I've um engaged with since like a a a smartphone but trying Oran which is meta's new AR glasses was was a really um jarring experience it's a very seamless AR environment where you're experiencing like screens and calls and um you're experiencing the world in a very different way now the reason I I like bring all this up it's like you know obviously the world knows us as like the YouTube guys um is we're always trying to think about like how audiences will engage with uh content and storytelling and entertainment and I think in the world of wearables um you know if that does become a reality I'd be curious to hear your POV on it it does feel like some of these products are the first products we've tried that feel like could this replace the iPhone um in in in a lot of years from now and and if so what does that mean for how people are watching things um today the share of watch time on connected TVs for YouTube has gone up dramatically for our Channel specifically 58% of our watch time comes from connected TVs and uh viewers are watching on average 42 minutes on connected TVs when we started on YouTube people were watching on desktop uh it wasn't really like massive share of watch time on mobile uh and so you think about just like these devices are how we consume content it's how we consume entertainment um does the the world of wearables suggest that if we now get our kind of uh this pass through environment back then maybe we're more interested in audio uh content that we can consume while we're doing other things uh are we down to have videos playing in in that world of course I'm like talking about a very distant future uh but that was that's that's what we're thinking about it's like where do where do audiences move uh in the future and how personalized does content get to an audience one one thing that I think about when when you paint that Future Vision is what stage are we in currently like when is this going to hit mainstream adoption I know that Mark Zuckerberg said a few days ago that he thinks that by 2030 uh this platform is basically going to start uh replacing like it it'll surpass uh mobile phones um smart glasses will surpass mo mobile phones according to Mark Zuckerberg do you think he's high on his own Supply there or do you think he is directionally correct or you what are your thoughts there potentially I think that the in terms of being directionally correct like it it does make sense when you experience it it's hard to explain if you haven't experienced it um but I think the the primary thing is like using um Orion felt like both Colin and I said this it felt like we got our hands back and it also felt like we got our posture back like I think there will be a moment in human history where we look back and go that was weird that we were all hunched over these like black rectangles all day you know like I think that will be something that we're like huh that's strange and when I look at like my dad um you know was is a lifelong entrepreneur and he he started a company Back in 1970 when he when he 1976 when he landed here in in the states and the photos of him working shh don't tell anyone but I've got 30 plus startup ideas that could make you millions and I'm giving them away for free these aren't just random guesses they're validated Concepts from entrepreneurs who built hundred million plus businesses I've compiled them into one simple database compiled from hundreds of conversations I've had on my podcast but the main thing is most of these ideas don't need a single investor some cost nothing to start I'm pretty much handing you a cheat sheet the idea bank is your startup shortcut just click below to get access your next cash flowing business is waiting for you are him sitting at a desk with a telephone and a bunch of papers and you think about like what does someone working look like today it's like a laptop in front of them that was not the case for my dad or our parents generation and so it's not crazy to think about for our kids when they start to work like when I'm a parent of a 20-year-old kid and or 25y old kid and he starts going to work like work probably looks totally different like the way he engaged with technology is going to look totally different and so that that's like directionally it feels like it makes sense um but uh I don't know like adoption is the biggest piece uh I think like people being very human beings being very uh uh conscious of like their image and looking into each other's eyes and like that's where the question comes into to play is like will we actually adopt this type of stuff uh but it like being there in the moment you're kind of like yeah this makes sense yeah I think uh I think about this a lot because I want to be okay when something hits mainstream adoption I want to have been preparing for years because as soon as it hits mainstream adoption there's so much competition from like a idea building perspective that you know it was way easier to launch an app in9 that got a lot of traction when the App Store first came out then in 2019 basically um my take on and I saw I saw some of the demos some of the or Orion demos and I was I was blown away frankly I was I was absolutely Blown Away um that being said I think I think it's going to be further than Zuck act you know predicts I think that my take is it's going to be maybe 2035 2040 and what that means is I would start experimenting within the next few years but experimenting with what like building apps for that environment or what yeah yeah I think um got it yeah I yeah I'd start building apps like um I think about you know one thing that comes top of mind is um when the internet first came out some of the biggest uh companies were ad networks um basically what what did people do there was websites um they negotiated Banner real estate deals um and then they they basically were a Marketplace um Nike you want access to yahoo.com we'll sell it to you what does that look like when you put on glasses like what is the what is the ad Network first of all amazing yeah these are the these are the Rayband metas and uh I wish you could hear the sound they just made when uh I put them on but these are like the clear ones it's it's pretty incredible to see like how much Tech is in these kind of glasses now and and I don't know if you have you worn these um I've worn the older versions okay it's a it's pretty compelling especially now they have like this feature that's like a look and tell me feature meaning like you can look at a building and go hey meta look and tell me what this building is and tell me the history behind it right so you're using voice to prompt um AI there and I think like the um the question in terms of like when you talk about like ad networks and when the internet first launched like that that being a a major factor I think the question is like the fragmentation of attention right so if we if we keep going down that path of going there was a point when we were kids where there was a lot of monoculture right like whatever was on TV was on TV that's what we all watched um and if you think about like today if you're walking down the street and you look around you're like okay all of these people on the street today potentially listen to a podcast this morning but it's probably likely that none of them listen to the same one um and that's pretty wild and maybe there's overlap like maybe five of them listen to the same one or something like that um but when you extrapolate that further and think about like uh wearables as well as AI the question becomes like how hyper personalized does everything get to you like is it actually that everyone can listen to a completely personalized version of a uh of a podcast in the morning or completely personalized experience through their their own glasses um and then the question becomes like what do you serve like personal uh personalized ads to each of them like how what is everyone's experience like in a world of like incredibly fragmented culture I mean the the Arc of technological uh progress and I don't know if it's societal progress I'm just talking about technological progress is that the internet has become more and more personalized over time um and you know right now ad creative isn't personalized for the most part um but ad targeting is pretty pretty darn surgical at this point with meta and Google so it only makes sense that with AI um that uh AI is going to make the ability to create oneofone ads um that are going to show up on your glasses on mobile on on web in real time yeah you're looking at your closet and it's like you know what's missing yeah the totally the Sev I jacket yeah right like you know what would go well with these pants that you're wearing right now when you look in the mirror um the uh there's this really interesting software that I I uh was sent yesterday called notebook LM are you familiar with this I am but for people explain it for what people people people who don't know I mean this as far as I understand it and how I used it but essentially notbook LM is a Google software where you can load in sources so the example would be um load in like I loaded in three articles one about the new snap AR glasses one about the new meta ones and then uh one like just kind of think piece on the world of AR and uh it gave me in a Nine Minute Podcast that was Two Hosts talking uh essentially developing a podcast uh using the source material about all these the essentially giving me a podcast about the state of AR the difference between snaps glasses meta glasses and all the above um and it's compelling it's not like it's it's obviously you can tell it's AI but it's it's like there's a moment where the host clears his throat there's a moment where like The Two Hosts talk over each other uh there's a moment where they like make little quips and jokes and Segways and so then I loaded in like our um we have a newsletter that we send three times a week called the published press and I loaded two issues of that in and it actually edited down stories and uh made Segways and made things that made sense and didn't make sense and um it was it was a glimpse into like a potential future when you think about from a Content perspective you're like I have a 20 minute commute and I want to know about what just happened in the world of YouTube I want to know about the NFL and fantasy updates and I also want to hear a takeaway from the VP debate last night and you load those in and it's like here's your podcast that's 20 minutes long that matches your commute that's personalized for what you just um that's a really I mean honestly as a content creator it's like a a little bit of a frightening future of how hyper-personalized can this stuff get um and what does that mean for the future if like it's a more efficient way to get exactly what I wanted is that is that actually a great experience for uh audiences uh is that actually something we're going to want um over long periods of time okay so this is this is what I want to get into you know and you know knowing what you know now speaking to the Zuck of the world like how are you positioning yourself so that you you know you and Colin and the Colin and Samir show to to build a a content and entertainment Empire that you know is is well position you know as as technology evolves in this direction yeah we you know it's it is challenging right like competition is at an all-time high for attention and like that's like it will continue to be more and more challenging to uh not only capture someone's attention but hold their attention like in a in a world of infinite opportunity uh it's really hard it's something that we call exit velocity um when it comes to like short form content or long form content or a podcast like it's highly likely that there's some people who clicked on this maybe thought it would be interesting for them then left and so we think about that is like this this term exit velocity like how how fast does someone like check this out and then leave and you think about like short form content like a Tik Tok or YouTube shorts or Instagram reals has the highest uh potential exit velocity right like someone is firing through those just going like let me see the next thing and you have to have such a compelling hook to capture someone's attention now I think um you know YouTube and social and creating content for these platforms is very much like a video game it's like solving an equation of how to capture attention how to write a compelling hook uh I think if you're doing that strictly for the the currency of of viewership and like the the video game reward of of high viewership or virality uh I think that's where you're going to get pretty lost over long periods of time so Colin and I try and take a step back and go uh first of all uh what is our like degree of difference what makes us unique what's our what's our unique perspective um and you know what makes us uniquely human it's a weird thing to say but it's it is something that we think about and we try and lean into situations formats uh content that can bring that out because at the end of the day like the reality is today for Content formats are not defensible uh personality and perspective is uh and and I think that's like the most important thing that everyone can do to position themselves for the future so if I'm understanding this correctly it's almost like a venai so on one one circle is formats and compelling formats and the other circle is what am I uniquely equipped for is that right yeah I think it's it's uh you know we we we often talked about this as a a a concept of content Market fit which is uh you know three things have to be checked one is uh what you want to make that's actually something that it sounds ridiculous but a lot of people skip skip that step it's like do I actually want to make this uh because to do it successfully you're going to be making it for years and years and years and you have to just love the process of making it so do I want to make it uh the second is like is there an audience for this is there is is this content that somebody actually wants uh which is another honest question you have to ask yourself and then the third is like does this match the platform's wants and needs and actually those three can uh evolve over time like just because they're all checked in like green on all three one week does not mean that it's the same thing the next month um those all kind of oscillate and change like again if you look at where YouTube is heading even with their announcements that made on YouTube two weeks ago like the you can you can gather that they are heading in the direction of more and more connected TV viewership connected TV viewership means 30 plus minute videos that are organized into series um that can be watched you know they they launched a new UI update for connected TV that's organized by seasons and episodes and you look at that it looks just like Netflix so what the platform is is essentially signaling signaling to all creators is we're looking for serialized formats that look and feel like streamers so isn't that isn't that the opportunity right like if if YouTube yeah of course right if YouTube is basically putting their money where their mouth is and making a bet that we want to be Netflix 2.0 we want to be the evolution of Netflix yeah and we're designing the product to with those constraints shouldn't we be hiring the best you know videographers in the world the people who've worked on the best television shows and say like hey this is the niche we're in come and like work with us maybe I don't know if adding more crew is the answer to solving a Content problem like I really don't believe that I think if it's warranted sure if like your show or format requ crew and and uh a specific type of camera because you want it or specific type of audio because it's it's it's what the format is asking for sure but one of the most prolific creators on YouTube right now is Ryan Tran uh he can't make a video that does under 10 million views but he shoots majority of his stuff with his iPhone and just by himself um so you know we you also have to take a step back and go what what has he done really successfully again his unique personality his unique perspective that's an intangible some people have it some people don't that's an intangible he's also been on the platform for ex a very long time and gone through multiple iterations he loves the video making process um but he has found himself into some really successful formats um he does these formats where he tries different types of airbnbs and those have taken off and the goal of a YouTube Creator uh which is also probably the goal of any startup founder is to identify what the audience is reacting to and then double down in that direction and again that's like directly aligning with the world of where content is moving and where um audiences are moving to go if I watch you know Ryan Tran I tried OMG or I stayed in OMG airbnbs uh on my connected TV the next video I'm going to jump to is Ryan Tran I stayed in underground hotels right it's like okay I stayed I stayed I stayed now this is a format uh that I'm watching they're all around the same length they all have the same host they all start the same way it's familiar and I think familiarity is a uh is a metric that is incredibly important in in the world that we are moving in in a world where we have an abundance of choice familiarity is going to win I think that's right I also think uh you know I was watching this do you know this guy Daniel dalan he's a new Creator upand cominging guy went from like zero to 100K Subs in a few months and he he went viral within the entrepreneurial Community because his title was POV you're a you know a 26-year-old entrepreneur living in China um and he does these POV videos and it's really like the POV of an entrepreneur um and you know now you have hundreds or thousands of creators copying him being like POV this POV that but that just actually lends like it's not the same right it's you know you Daniel d is getting is the OG right yeah I think the unfortunate reality is actually that in content that does work uh and and I'm not saying that that is a positive like I think as a creative you should have integrity to be like I I'm not just gonna take someone's idea one for one um you know but the reality of YouTube is like the flip side of what I just mentioned of familiarity is that you're not releasing anything into a vacuum right you're releasing something into to a uh content ecosystem where you know the there's there's like four different ways that audiences discover content on YouTube the first is search and I think probably people um over maybe maybe think about search too much it's actually pretty nominal uh how many people find videos through search the next is browse that means you open up the YouTube app and what's on my home feed uh what is YouTube giving me right now it could be creators I'm subscribed to it could be uh videos similar to one that I watch but uh browse is the next one the next one is suggested which is I'm watching a YouTube video and then on the right side I get suggested other content that's similar and then the the fourth way is the shorts feed so going through the shorts feed you might discover a Creator and then go to their Channel and find their videos so when you think about like why does that work it's it's largely because of the world of of uh again familiarity when you go on to the YouTube homepage and you just watched this POV I'm an entrepreneur now you see another one that's POV I'm an entrepreneur in Los Angeles and it is someone taking it and giving their own unique spin on it um but the the reason that works is because the audience is familiar with that format they had a good uh experience with that format and the YouTube algorithm is fully designed for viewer satisfaction right like if you just think about what how is it designed it's like did this person enjoy it and if they did let's give them something else that uh we predict they will enjoy and the metrics to track there are click through was it a high clickthrough rate of they saw this thumbnail and they clicked into it and then did they watch for a long time average view duration and those two stats are going to give you the uh understanding if like the viewer was satisfied and then more content's going to surface like that so the reason you see people saying I'm not just going to make my own format I'm gonna look at what works on YouTube and try and piggyback off of that because that's like the quickest path to audience growth on YouTube plain and simple um but again I would say like as a as a creative coming into the space like I I don't really have the stomach for that and it probably like stunts our growth because it would be easier to just look at what's working and do that um and I've also had uh we had a great conversation with Austin Cleon who wrote the book steal like an artist uh and I think I like really believe in the principles that that he talks about in that can you talk can you talk more about that yeah I think like there's a there's a difference between like good theft and and uh you know bad theft uh there's a really simple term that that he he talks about of like even yourself being copied of um the elevator test like if you get into an elevator with someone who copied your work or uh would they patch you on the back or would they punch you in the face where it's just like uh like we all know the feeling of if someone like takes something we do uh and you're like that's like way too similar to what I do uh you would you would be upset if they walked into an ele elevator with you and then you know the feeling of someone who is inspired by you and they they make something you're like dude great great job with that um that's like a really uh simple simplified version of it um but you know the the other thing he talks about is um in the beginning and we did this as creators plain and simple like when we first started as the Colin Channel we were desperately trying to be like Casey neistat I think everyone was at that era uh he was like this amazing daily vlogger uh was able to tell stories about his daily life that uh it just felt like no one had ever seen before everyone wanted to be like him and we tried our best and failed miserably he's a much better Storyteller and also lived a much more interesting life but the interesting part about that is uh what Austin Cleon talks about is like you're taking apart the car uh so you're like reverse engineering this thing you really like and starting to feel what it feels like to make that and a lot of times creative people need like an impetus of like what do I make um ideas are like the one of the most challenging parts of creativity it's not the technical ability a lot of people can film and edit now it's what the hell do I make so um taking aart the car seeing the different parts seeing how it all comes together uh reverse engineering is a really great tactic in learning how to do something but then you got to put it together in a different way you got to put it back together in your own way if you keep putting it back together in the exact same way it's just uninteresting quick ad break let me tell you about a business I invested in it's called boring marketing.com so a few years ago I met this group of people that were some of the best SEO experts in the world they were behind getting some of the biggest companies found on Google and the secret sauce is they've got a set of technology and AI that could help you outrank your competition so for my own businesses I wanted that I didn't want to have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I didn't want to depend on ads to drive customers to my businesses I wanted to rank high in Google that's why I like SEO and that's why I use boring marketing.com and that's why I invested in it they're so confident in their approach that they offer a 30-day Sprint with 100% money back guarantee who does that nowadays so check it out highly recommend boring marketing.com what do you say to people who say that there's nothing new on the Sun so there's no format that hasn't been tried already you know what's your reaction to that there's there's definitely Merit to that I don't I think like um you know creativity is like looking through a kaleidoscope right it's like you're just seeing different um uh different like versions of uh light going through and getting like you know changed around so I think like I think there's a ton of Merit to that I think everything is a remix and I think you're constantly collaborating with like your own inputs and things that you've seen so I I agree with that statement but I do think that like some of this is just as an audience know when something feels fresh and something feels new and someone put their own unique spin on it versus when you're like that's kind of the same thing totally yeah it kind of reminds me of like in startup land product Market fit the term product Market fit you know I get that question a lot around how do you know if you have product Market fit if you're asking yourself do I have product Market fit you know you probably don't have product Market fit you know but if you're trying to keep the servers up um because you have so many customers coming through the door you probably have product Market fit the same is true with copying stealing that sort of thing you know deep down if you took someone's format and 100% yeah right yeah but it is it's challenging like plain and simple it's it's hard to break through on social platforms today uh it's hard to break through specifically on YouTube and uh a lot of that is because of the uh the barrier that's very different from other platforms which is the thumbnail I'm sure you've experienced this now with you know putting your podcast on YouTube is a totally different game than having your podcast in RSS feeds right dude it's it's sobering like YouTube has sobered me sobered me right like I I come from Twitter and and just general podcast and now putting you know I I could record the most what I think is the most value ad podcast on the planet I put it uh I I launch it I'm you know I I I press publish I'm so excited this is going to hit a million views and clickthrough rate is 3% average you know view duration is low um people you know it's just not getting fed to the the YouTube algorithm because of the title and thumbnail in a lot of ways the the the first rule of YouTube that we talk about uh and this is part of our our um which I'm sure we we'll talk about our our um new businesses uh but it's it's part of our course called YouTube Playbook but the first rule is just if they don't click they don't watch it's just a really simple rule um of YouTube and you know what's hard about that is like you're talking about a medium like podcasting where you're the behavior of an audience member on like who's listening on Spotify is going to be actually completely different than the behavior of someone who clicks into YouTube um and the challenge is as a Creator how do you not totally miss that audience that's like just down with your podcast to try and hook an audience in this new environment um it's really hard and and you know earlier we talked about exit velocity like you think about this uh this world of like going to a movie it would be really weird if you like walked into a movie sat down and then like uh you know 30 seconds into the movie you were like yeah this isn't for me I'm out but actually on YouTube that's really common uh like if you retain 90% of people uh on YouTube in the first 30 seconds you're like damn that that was a really good hook a really good intro and if 70% of the people are watching after the first five minutes you're like holy smokes dude I'm like we're really doing this uh that like thinking about that Concept in the context of like a movie theater would be absurd if if 30% of the people walked out uh of a movie five minutes in um but it's just the culture like what YouTube is and and and how challenging it is to keep someone's attention and so there's there's also the conversation around like which envir do you create what content in especially us as creators when we think about you know we are YouTube creators through and through we've been making YouTube videos since 2010 2011 um but we think about like how do we balance our environments between permission and Interruption so you know YouTube is like an interruption based platform like I have to interrupt your experience with a compelling title and thumbnail to get you to watch podcast feeds are actually permission-based as well as newsletters are permission-based um because like somebody has given you permission to give them that content they're much more likely to spend time with it give it a chance uh slowly go into it you have different um you have different levels of attention on every platform and so I think a lot of YouTube creators aim to especially like YouTube creators like us who are more in the educational uh space or or or like thought leadership space we try and get our audience uh as much as we can the ones who want to give us permission to go from an interruption based platform into a permission based platform like a newsletter or um you know exclusive content on an RSS feed or an educational course like we want to get uh audiences into those environments or like a patreon right those are like more permission based environments so I want to talk I want to talk a few ideas with you and and I want to double double down on that a little bit um I remember having coffee with you and uh Colin in in New York City um and you were kind of early with this idea around you know being a Creator is a treadmill in a lot of ways and I and you were early to creating the newsletter and the business around the newsletter and you were you were early to basically you know saying like I've got all this attention over here and I'm going to create content that I think is really cool and interesting for my audience here and then I'm going to go you know Leverage is a bad word it sounds like you're taking Advantage but you know you're just going to use you know some of those some of those eyeballs to um to to monetize it um and I want to know how you're thinking about like where how creators could monetize and some new ideas around um around monetizing attention yeah so uh you know there's there's um there's an abundance of ways to to monetize but I think the uh the most important is that you think about it as like a value prop extension so meaning like what is my value proposition of my content who's the specific audience what is the value prop and then how do I extend that value proposition um through what I'm offering so an example of that is like obviously if you know for us uh our mission is to like educate and empower the next generation of creators right so education being at the Forefront what's the value prop extension well it's more education right and so that uh monetizing through education through courses uh we also you know have a big uh piece of it that's Community focused so you know now we're moving into events where we have in-person events um that people can come attend um and our newsletter is further education about what's going on in the world of Creator so everything is like an extension of that now in terms of like the the primary way every YouTube Creator makes money is advertising that's going to be um you know AdSense uh which is just straight up what YouTube will pay through the platform rev share uh but then brand deals are typically like the largest sum of every Creator's U monetization and the uh the same rules apply there of like value proposition extension so when we first started our show and it first started to get some traction what we did is we wrote down every brand that shared the same Mission so every brand that we felt was like which brands also uh educate and Empower creators well you know let's let's look at the brands that are offering you know software solutions for creators think about like Adobe Adobe empowers so many creators right Riverside is a is a sponsor of ours they Empower a ton of creators so let's let's make a list of everyone who shares the same Mission with us and then let's go tell them our story um you know and and that is how we got most of our first sponsors our first big sponsor was Samsung they had the exact same Mission hey we we think our new phones um empower the modern Creator that's our mission too great it's it's always a more natural fit in advertising than trying to like jam something in and we we've done that in the past too right when we first started out looking for advertisers like uh it can be hard to to talk about something that either you don't use or doesn't feel value prop aligned um and so you know that that's like the core of monetization is like what is my value proposition and how do I extend that into either telling you about someone else that shares that value proposition or offering you a good or service that is uh connected to that value proposition as well so events I'm I'm so happy you said events because this is something I've been thinking a lot about I think that um there was this surge around you know online communities uh PID memberships and and that's still going to continue to be and grow as a category but I think that right now we're kind of early on this um I like this Creator and I believe in what this Creator says and it the creator has to be uh somewhat niche in my opinion um and then and then it's like I'm going to go create an event where I'm going to bring this whole identity of people together and it's going to be amazing and events are a hassle to create but they are multi-million dollar opportunities they're hard they're hard to nail right like um throwing a good party isn't easy uh and you actually have to think about like how it how it functions what it feels like the venue the food the coffee like and Colin and I that our biggest bottleneck as entrepreneurs is taste so like we have very specific taste we're uncompromising with that taste um and I think that's actually across a lot of creators and creatives it's like taste is going to be your biggest bottleneck that's probably going to limit us from building massive companies but uh I that's okay with me like I'd prefer everything to to be on my taste um but I like events have been also the most energizing thing we've done uh the way we've thrown them too has been really really cool we we don't like Mass promote them um we promote them exclusively through the published press uh our newsletter so typically there's like an RSVP Link at the bottom of the news newslet it's like hey are you in La um you know RSVP here and and that's been really cool because it's kind of like a if you know you know um and we do these these mornings called coffee with creators and you know a bunch of creators show up uh typically we have like a hundred to 150 um creators and and creatives show up there's like good coffee you're having coffee you're meeting people we do like fun like uh you know kind of moving the room around doing prompts people can talk to each other and typically we have like a Q&A with a Creator or some uh some experience with with a Creator and what's been really cool is that um you know as many as we can go to because I enjoy it Colin and I go but we've also hosted these events in New York where we aren't there and I think that's been some of the most exciting is recognizing like this does represent a community this this is like a um a community brand and that like opportunity for scale is super interesting um like being at one of these coffee with creators uh more Mornings in my head I was like in the future couldn't this be happening in La Austin New York and SF all on the same morning of course um that's a really really cool future yeah it's a really exciting future because I also think it's like it's actually honestly transformational to like I can see it on people's faces when I'm there that they're enjoying it and that it made a difference in their day their experience their career and I think it solves like a real problem of loneliness and and community and validation and like so many of these human emotions that um we needed When We Were Young creators you know like we needed to be around other creators and look at them and go like this is hard right or like hey what do you think I should do about about this are working with this brand and they're asking for too many revisions just even feeling the community around those problems is really impactful it's really interesting because we started off this conversation talking about AR VR yeah and what would a minimal viable product to build now for that future and maybe it's Events maybe it's IRL events my my hypothesis about the future is that there will be a premium on inefficiency so let me explain that like uh you know I my wife and I went to go see John Mayor live and uh you know at the Forum in LA and you know I went over there it's a pain in the ass to to park you buy this expensive ticket you like go in it's kind of miserable you like have to go to the bathroom and it's really far you like get in and then John Mary starts playing and he's like it's super cool because he's like riffing and like playing his songs in a totally different way he's singing them in a different way um and as I got in my car you know we put on another John May album and in my head I was like oh putting John Mayor on on Spotify is the most efficient way to listen to John Mayer but the premium is we will pay hundreds of dollars for the spontaneity the inefficiency of getting into this room with a bunch of people and hearing him play it in a totally different way um and verifiably human so I also think about that as like a future right of like Collective experiences that are verifiably human that don't necessarily value like incredible efficiency uh is is really interesting because everything with AI is like we're all talking about efficiency it's more efficient to brainstorm with AI it just is give me you know hey give me 10 ideas for a YouTube title um that happens more efficiently with AI than in a room with uh like three other creatives and as we go down and look at that like we we do value efficiency quite a bit in in work and business and as we continue going but I think there's going to be also the inverse which is like the incredible value on inefficiency so all that's a very long-winded way of saying I agree I think event is like so important for the next chapter both for like people like humans but also in business I think it's a huge opportunity 100% by the way I have this theory that all guys comment if you disagree with me but or agree with me all guys want to be like John Mayor yeah dude of course of course I don't think is that like a is that like a hot take or like a theory because that feels like it feels like relatively like squarely on the not uh like he's the guy guy right yeah I don't I don't have the height to be like John Mar John Mar is so tall but he's like he's super cool and smooth and like to be able to sing like that that' be amazing I also think that isn't it true that when you go to a concert even if the concert is worse like the sound quality isn't as good or they don't play your favorite song when you get back in the car and you play Spotify don't you enjoy that artist like 10 times more all sudden for sure of course you have like a deep emotional connection you had a you had an experience like I think that's uh that's a really important part of the future I think like yeah it's just it's just more and more important yeah that's why I'm doubling down on events so 2025 you'll be you know I haven't announced it publicly but I'll be doing way more events uh great and it's for this reason I think the AR and VR component like you know we didn't really talk too much about the VR component but if you let's say you're living in Mumbai but the event is in the col events in Miami course wouldn't it be great if you can have some of that same experience I I'm not like I'm not hot on VR oh here we go I'm not I just think it's uh and and maybe it's also like I I don't know I just think like fully immersive experiences are um very Niche like wearing an apple Vision Pro and being fully immersed in an experience I was like this is at least for me it's not it's not for me I like don't want to be fully immersed wearing a Ryan and experiencing like AR I'm like or mixed reality I'm like this is interesting because I'm still a part of the world and I can still look someone in the eyes but I'm having a you know a modern experience here um I think VR in the context of like gaming I think fully immersive gaming is interesting the first thing I thought when I put on Apple Vision Pro was like courtside tickets to the Lakers would be really cool if I could buy them through Apple Vision Pro and like sit Courtside and look around like that's really cool but I just think full immersion is like incredibly Niche and probably won't take off you don't think that in 2035 your Orion's 2035 Edition will have like okay mixed reality okay uh full full VR definitely I I definitely think they will have that option but I don't think like VR bulky VR headsets are going to be widely adopted I just don't think so I mean it's probably also a stretch like if we see a world where wearable glasses are like widely adopted that actually would be pretty wild uh you know like if everyone is wearing it's it's not weird for you and I because we like I wear glasses as well I'm wearing contacts right now like I've worn glasses my whole life uh to put on a different type of glasses I'd be like okay cool but people have never worn glasses like I don't know it's hard to imagine it's it's more it's easier to imagine a world where it's like headphones and like a wristband or something uh you know with the option to like put the glasses on yeah yeah I I agree I'm with you I I think uh mixed reality will take off first um I do think that at some point full immersion will be I mean think about if like we're going to get to a point where it's not even you won't even need glasses it'll be like contact lenses basically maybe yeah but like how is that re I don't I don't know like I I have no idea when I you know I'm I'm actually my wife and I are expecting we're having kid in January and I've been thinking a lot about like what does his life look like in 15 years when he's 15 years old that'll be um you know 20 40 what does the world look like when he's 15 years old because when I was 15 years old I had a Motorola Razor uh you know what I mean like I was I experienced the world like so much has happened in that amount of time uh how unrecognizable is his life going to be like to me uh in 15 years as like a a teenage boy I I don't know I don't know what that looks like I just I try and sometimes just sit and think about it and go like what the hell is that going to look like I think you know the answer I think you're you probably know the answer but you're probably afraid to to say it I know I am you know I can just speak for myself like you know you're seeing what's happening with like neuralink um chips being implanted in your brain um that seems to be the direction that technology is going contact lenses things implanted in your brain um AI you know being smarter than human beings robots that you know look and feel like humans can I can I totally shift into pitching you a business idea and you tell me if it's a good or bad idea yeah let's do it it's one I've thought about for like a really long time and Colin and I have always talked about so um we're we're like because we've spent most of our career like in incredibly long editing sessions um we've always like experimented with different uh you know like whether it's caffeine or like neut Tropics like uh eleanine or like um you know stuff like uh um there's these these mints called neurom mints I don't know if you've ever like tried those and basically it's like caffeine alanine and b12 like mixed into a mint um and it's it's like it's always been a product we've been relatively passionate about especially in the context of like creators and creators being in our audience um two two different products one is like hydration which has been wildly popularized by like liquid IV and element and stuff like that and then like a neut Tropic brand like an alpha brain or like a neurom Min so just wanted to to start there like I've never explored cpg but we've always talked about it in like okay we could literally have one at every episode we could um you know Market this in the context of creativity and like empathy with like what our audience is going through it's always been just like a very blue sky like fun idea to talk about uh over lunch but never ever something we've actually explored did you see that I'm going to answer that question but did you see that Mr Beast is Raising $150 million at I think $ 1.5 billion valuation and he's doing it to double down on his cpg products and I know one of the VCS who are who's looking at investing and he called me up and he said what what do you think he wanted my opinion on it and I said I don't understand what's going through Jimmy's brain creating a cpg company is painful uh like the operations the shipping uh the consistency it it's no walk in the park um Jimmy has actually been experimenting with software so view stats view stats yeah uh is actually doing from what I can see quite well um and I wouldn't be surprised if he creates a crater software Tool Company worth $1.5 billion on50 to100 million of Revenue I my feedback I was like tell Jimmy this I was like just do more software do more digital products yeah it's a good note you know and if you are and so if I'm you like would it be fun to do that cpg project project absolutely would it be like cool also like I can see like the ads right now like you know you take it out you put it in like people lock in um but I do think that if I yeah if I were you i' would partner with someone to like ma do everything you guys are just advisers and like co-founders but if I were you and this is a question for you I'll bring it back to you it's like why aren't you doing more software yeah it's a good question um we're we've been heavily involved in a software called spotter Studio which is a ideation software for creators it's it's really cool actually like the the coolest part is that like it exists now and we use it on like a day-to-day basis we just actually created a uh really dope thumbnail with it yesterday um that now we're designing um so we're we're involved with that and that's been a really fun process I mean that's my honestly that's my first experience with software like truly with um even understanding what's possible in the context of software like sitting with their team and being like could it do this um so that that's been really cool and I think seeing like software come together has been a really powerful thing so the the short answer is like mostly because as creators our biggest problem is that we're opportunity rich and time poor um yeah and so Partnerships are always going to be like the cleanest way to get into stuff where it's like it's not we're not running a software company but we're supporting and Consulting and Advising um but the uh you know the the push for us is into digital products specifically education the question is like can that can that type of stuff turn into can software be education um you know can that be an extension of what we're doing because I I I I do think that sounds really really fun and really interesting and having this experience has been cool like I I had never experienced anything like some of the best software products have education you know built within you know I I was I just logged into right before this uh it was just rebranded to kit.com convertkit and you know when you log into the dashboard it's like you know video of jaylaa how I went from zero to 50,000 email subscribers like there's there's videos and education built in so I think that once I could see a world where your educational products evolve into software products software products yeah totally I I agree with that um yeah it's fun I mean our the biggest problem in the Creator economy is like operators it it will continue to be the biggest problem like people are growing and getting more opportunities than they can handle and at the end of the day like we're still the Arbiters of taste of our content like some some creators have really successfully scaled well and found people who can uh support their their uh growth and expansion and keep the content engine running but like our first product is content our first customer is our audience and like the reality is when we wake up in the morning that's what we think about like everything else is is is uh come secondary and so you know the challenge for us is to get to a point where we have support in that direction and we can go okay what where else can we put our minds because a as creatives and like entrepreneurs I'm very stimulated by all that it's super fun um but just you know needing to get out or finding a way even emotionally to get out of the the day-to-day of content is is is Art 100% dude I've taken up too much of your time you've been so gracious with your time thank you for coming on Samir where could people get to know you more and and just learn more about what you're working on I mean first and foremost Colin and Samir just check our YouTube channel out that would be awesome um if you are interested in YouTube and starting a YouTube channel or exploring how to get better at YouTube we have a new ideation Sprint that's about to launch just go to Colin inmar.com ideas and if you want to learn about the world of Creator economy subscribe to our newsletter it's called the publish press I think this audience I mean this is an idea audience so I'm sure a lot of people are going to be interested in that um and I can just just speak for myself and just say that YouTube uh it's it's such a good way to get your ideas out there as an entrepreneur and build an audience and and you know attract like-minded people so highly recommended on on uh on my and love that dude congrats on this pod this is cool it's cool to see it picking up like this I mean I'm not like a professional interviewer like you I I'm an you know I'm building businesses and I just do this to to to spend time with cool people and and to to serve the community but um I'm learning a wise man named Tim Ferris told me uh to bifurcate the two rewards you get from podcasting the first reward is the conversation once the conversation is done you should look back and go that was an awesome conversation I'm glad I got to have that the second reward is the performance and the results of that episode and conversation and so think about those as two different things that has really helped me along the path because performance is an up and down volatile volatile experience as a content creator but the reward is just getting to spend time and connecting with people and sharing ideas like that's a that's a really beautiful reward that uh you don't want to let go of I love that all right thanks for sharing that I appreciate that I'll see you around [Music]

all right uh I feel very lucky to be talking to amjad CEO of repet product I use all the time a lot I know a lot of people on the startup ideas podcast use repet and I asked him to come and just help us us hundreds of thousands of people that are going to listen to this build their ideas with repet and he said yes well thank you for having me I mean it's uh this is this is really uh my people you know people who are building and love using ret uh you know I'm excited to be [Music] here um so first of all before we you know get into a live cooking session why should people use repet to build their you know to to take their ideas and and make them reality yeah so uh you know the the reason I'm I'm building this company is because I've been an entrepreneur uh you know ever since I can remember like I started bu I built my first business when I was like 12 uh and I remember how difficult it was to do everything from setting up a database to uh collaborating on code to like bringing in packages to maintaining everything to pushing to production or finding a way to get it out to the world and and that that sort of put me on a path that spent you know over a decade now kind of trying to make this process easier and so the fun fundamental philosophy behind that is that well there's people with so many amazing ideas in the world there's people with a lot of talents but how difficult coding is is kind of putting up this wall in front of a lot of creative people that could be bringing new products into into the world that you know could enrich the internet and our environment and uh and just I think that the more people making things I think I think just the the world is better and also there's like a social angle where you know the internet for the first time uh is is this magical place where you only don't need a lot of money to be able to create something and then you can really change your circumstances fundamentally so that's that's why I'm passionate about it yeah I also think uh the beauty is you know you don't need to be in Silicon Valley I know you're in Silicon Valley but you don't need to be in Silicon Valley to go and create something that millions of people use you can be anywhere um and use a tool like repet to go and and and build yeah yeah and and so what we what we do is uh you know try to keep that sort of term simple not use a lot of buzzwords but um you go into repet the first thing saying that like the core product is there's an editor in in in your browser so you don't have to download some kind of IDE or editor any or any of that we have a collection of hundreds of templates so whatever program language or framework you like we probably support that if we don't support it you you can also figure out how to make it work with repet we make those tools and tutorials available um and then you start a project uh and uh you start writing code or you generate code using our AI or you generate code using an external uh AI uh people like using Claud these days and by you know pacing it or putting it somehow into repet pushing it into repet um and you hit run rep will actually detect the packages that it needs to install will install them for you so you don't need to mess up with mess with a shell or do do all that stuff uh if you want to use Version Control it's also just point and click you don't have to go into the shell and and do that and when you're ready to uh to kind of deploy your project it's one click as well and and also if you want a database if you want a uh object storage if you want any sort of really cloud services that otherwise you would need to go figure out AWS or some other service for it those are also like a couple of clicks and uh and so so now you have an idea you come uplet you generate the code or write the code uh you bring in the dependencies and the databases and infrastructure and one click done and you have your your website up now on top of all of that uh we know that coding is still intimidating for a lot of people so we created um in beta we have this product called agent that does all of that for you so you don't even have to click and so you just put your idea there I will emphasize that it is in Early Access so it is still quite buggy we're fixing it really fast and but we've seen people with from all walks of life you know uh real estate agents from from Ohio uh you have uh you know uh uh yoga coaches uh therapists uh really I've never seen anything like that I've been working on repet for for many years and all these people are able to build uh right now because uh you can just interact with the environment using using natural language and um and and and that's the goal and repc kind of is buil built on open source standards so we use git we don't lock you in you want to download your code and go that's fine you can use external editors some people use vs code and cursor with the repet as well I know you cover that on your show um you can deploy elsewhere and so really the ethos of Open Source and and open standard and I can't think of a better person to teach us the ins and outs of of repit than you um um would you be open to kind of sharing your screen and just you know demoing how you think about it and maybe giving people uh some tips and trips tips and tricks along the way absolutely let's do it I love it shh don't tell anyone but I've got 30 plus startup ideas that could make you millions and I'm giving them away for free these aren't just random guesses they're validated Concepts from entrepreneurs whove built hundred million plus businesses I've compile them into one simple database compiled from hundreds of conversations I've had on my podcast but the main thing is most of these ideas don't need a single investor some cost nothing to start I'm pretty much handing you a cheat sheet the idea bank is your startup short short cut just click below to get access your next cash flowing business is waiting for you and while you're pulling it up I think repet is one of those tools and I don't say this lightly to everyone listening this is like a tool of a a generation so many of us have ideas but they we know we struggle with putting it out there and repet especially where repits going with agents uh makes it so much easier all right this this looks I see your screen now all right awesome all right so let's um uh let's improvise something do you have an idea to give me so so that it doesn't look like I prepared something um do I have an idea to give you like something is it is it crazy to do something with location yeah we can do location so um a a let's say like maybe a map of some of the scenic drives in in the Bay Area that that sounds that sounds perfect that sounds hard so let's see uh and do you mind just zooming in a little bit as well yeah so this is relet's homepage so we're going to use the agent at least as the access point so we'll we'll go into the coding as well but repet agent is like great at setting up the project so we're going to use it to kind of set up the project get the initial get the initial prototype going um and you could of course create the project manually and we'll cover that in a bit but let's go through the agent now so I just type like just in a sentence like a map of scenic drives in the Bay Area I have no idea where it's going to pull the data from I have no idea what libraries it's going to use and again just a simple idea and we can hit start building now so this tells me it's still in Early Access um now uh any minute now we should go into a chat interface um and the agent should start working on proposing uh a plan for me and while while that's loading you know how indepth of a prompt should it be you know how short how in depth you know what what do you see as as best practice you know I I I like short prompts because um I like short prompts because the way I program is I have like an inlink of an idea and I like to do it in iterative fashion and so it also depends how how you think I think it's easy to over complicate things at the at the top and so I like to see something on the screen before getting in and like uh you know adding more complexity so you know here it's kind of pick the stock it's going to use streamlet that's that's fine by me it's going to build an initial prototype and uh you know it proposes all sorts of interesting features that we can add but I'm just going to go with the Prototype here so and then we can add some more features as we go um and so the first thing you'll notice is it'll just start cranking out code and it's really fun to watch it crank out code and you can even St of start reading and learning maybe what it's uh what it's doing here it's like creating creating the data with the with the with the drives I think it's just making it up for now we can ask it to pull it from somewhere and bit um it's now installing the packages uh so this is you know all the python environment packages you would need to to be able to make this application realize it needs to install a little bit more packages here and now it's going to configure the app to to run um and this is again doing kind of standard Linux uh configuration and then any moment we should be able to see something on the screen I also you know for for the beginner uh developers who are listening to this and even intermediate if you don't know what a package is or something like that this is a great time to just start googling and and and learning as you're as you're building I think that's uh a fun way to to learn how to code that's exactly right so here it um uh this is actually kind of my favorite drive across the Pacific Highway Coast so it kind of created a prototype it has some Skyland Boulevard is where uh you're not in the Bay Area are you I lived in the Bay Area for eight nine years so I know it well have have you been to Skyline I actually haven't I guess I don't know what that will so this is the car scene in SF so this is where all the Lamborghinis and uh really fast cars and motorcycles go because it's like this big uh Scenic stretch Road and there's like like a burger and bar and and gas station in the Middle where everyone everyone's there kind of showing off their cars so it got the right things there um and it has some some information here but also has some bugs like there's like an image here that that is not rendering we can select a a drive and it can show us the drive here um you can see on the right I'm already testing the uh the app on the right here is asking us is the scenic drives in the Bay Area App working can you see the interactive map and list of scenic drives so um so one of the cool things about how we built the agent is that it it is kind of like a coworker you can imagine it's like a junior software developer um and so it's kind of constantly ask you for feedback and so here yes it's uh working but I can see that there are images that are not rendering on the screen also the um the drive description on the map is hard to read maybe add a back a solid background so this is based on a you know bit of uh using the app you can sort of give it feedback it'll now try to debug and figure out what went wrong uh in in that bug whatever it is and then try to fix what I asked it to fix in the meantime let me show just the IDE features so as as it's coding I can just navigate here on uh to the code so here you have a full uh full featured code editor uh I can go in here and and code directly or use the built-in AI to do you know uh changes um uh that are more local because the agent generally does you know bigger changes in in the app uh I can invite someone to code together and this is if you've used um Google Docs is a really great experience to kind of code code with other people um so here it uh it updated the uh the app and it's asking me for more feedback uh you can also see here that it made a checkpoint so if we don't like what it did I can kind of roll back to an earlier checkpoint so it gives you control over what's what's sort of uh missing so what I think is happening is that it's unable to render this car icon um and so you know as you're trying to navigate the bugs with it it's it's sort of you can learn what's going on and sometimes you can sort of give it um give it sort of hints uh about what's going and what's going on here so maybe I'm gonna open the dev tools see what's going on well I can just sell it no uh no neither of those things happened so it of again it's a junior developer it often makes mistakes and and we can sort of iterate back and forth with it I just have a a a product question I have to ask you while while this is happening why did you decide to call it you know replit agent versus giving it a name like the Greg the Greg agent or yeah you know Greg Greg engineer Greg would have been a wonderful name uh but the uh you know our our sort of philosophy at at repet with with naming is we we we don't want to um we don't want to set the expectations too high so if we made it as if it's like an actual person then people will have a much higher expectations of the of the product and I think you know naming uh really really matters uh you know Tesla for example is now rolling out ass they're actually self-driving uh sorry uh actually smart summon product so the initial product is SM sum was smart summon now it's called dumb summon and ass is the actually smart summon and so you get into this sort of um uh you know uh treadmill and naming when you set the when you set the the bar too high agent is kind of generic right it is an agent it doesn't it's we didn't name it autopilot or or automatic coder or or what have you or a person's name because we we just want to set the expectation that this is um this is something that is uh going to be trying its best to do what you ask it for uh but not necessarily always succeeding yeah and I think that's a good lesson in all products yeah exactly so um so so here we're kind of uh hitting a problem with the images I'm just going to tell it just just remove the image just remove the car image please it's not working and I guess uh the lesson there is you know maybe talk a little bit about how to think about debugging and you know reducing your variables and stuff like that yeah so um in this case like it's adding a feature that I didn't ask for in the first place it wanted to render sort of a car image in the in the map and it's showing up as a broken image and I was like really don't need that feature and it's trying really hard to to to render that car image and I'm like okay just remove that and so it added it added these um markers which I think are a lot better and now we have these uh uh these popups that tell me information about the rid which is way way better so this is this is great um so got to tell it uh yes popups are visible and it's working correctly um so so you know often times uh changing uh the requirement slightly when the agent is is hitting a a problem might kind of net out a a better experience um and now let me show you how to deploy this app and then we'll make some more changes I'll show you some other features so deploying an app meaning you taken application that is in development right if you notice here it says rep Dev this is a development URL you should not share that with the world you you can but this is not ideal it is um uh it is not going to be the most optimized version of it and it'll also go down after a time but if you want to keep it up forever if you want we can just set up this deployment so here it tells us like you know what kind of machine configuration do you want it tells you how much it's going to cost you I'm going to select something really small because I don't think it's G to it's it's that expensive of uh or or that you know performance of an app so uh here the Run command is automatically configured by the agent I don't have to do anything else really I'm just going to hit deploy um and so now this is gonna uh build a package uh it's going to ship it over to Google Cloud we use Google Cloud for for backend deployments and well actually it's a very secure deployment as well will create a project just for this just for this uh this deployment and that deployment will stay up you can like look at logs uh once we start getting users you can look at analytics here you can look at the browsers devices countries where people are coming from so it gives you the entire kind of feature set needed to manage a production deployment and I don't think people realize how amazing this is as you know I'm a bad engineer and the fact that you've abstracted all of this away and just basically you press a button and it's deployed securely like this is how big of a deal is this it's pretty big deal like uh like again when uh I mean if you if you want to try to like figure out you know for example like how to deploy to a how to deploy to AWS uh let's see here what Google tells us uh first of all you need to look for something is AWS amplify it gives you a choice code deploy or amplify okay what does that mean uh so you get started under deliver you choose deploy and continue name your app environment you select the app and the code of the console save deploy and so you you need to figure out how to use the AWS CLI you need to figure out how to uh put your application code in there so you need to use something called SCP andftp what what the hell is this like what is SCP and how do you use it so now you're down this thing called secure copy protocol and you need to be able to uh use it you know open a shell and and and type a command and know how to use it and you're already down a rabbit hole that you really don't want to be down and so for us here we're just really try to make it a couple clicks you get all the security and all the features you need out of really any kind of um the best uh cloud Cloud providers available and and uh I will say also our prices are very very affordable are in line with are very competitive in line with the really top top Cloud providers yeah I just know that like in the past when I've built stuff and deployed it it's like so scary so the fact that you know you just press a button and it's done just like it it makes me it makes me want to come back and build more stuff because I don't have that scary part of deploying so here here's the deployed app so Bay or scenic routes one aasad ret app so anyone can could go to that and be able to use it now it's still booting up here but it is a production app it is on the internet uh and and and you're done and now we can go back to the app and kind of do some more some more things um and and this and crucially we can go to the app and do more things and this will not break this will continue being up and that's the important things about deployment is that it is now separating your development environment from the deployment environment quick ad break let me tell you about a business I invested in it's called boring marketing.com so a few years ago I met this group of people that were some of the best SEO experts in the world they were behind getting some of the biggest companies found on Google and the secret sauce is they've got a set of technology and AI that could help you outrank your competition so for my own businesses I wanted that I didn't want to have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I didn't want to depend on ads to drive customers to my businesses I wanted to rank high in Google that's why I like SEO and that's why I use boring marketing.com and that's why I invested in it they're so confident in their approach that they offer a 30-day Sprint with 100 % money back guarantee who does that nowadays so check it out highly recommend boring marketing.com now uh I I want to just show a few things that that we also abstract our way that are very very nice so we have post grass uh databases so postr is kind of the state-of-the-art database you might have heard of superbay and other databases like that um and and we can oneclick uh integrate into the project or you can ask the agent to do that so I'm going to just ask agent um I want to use uh postgress DB instead of the CSV and be able to add new drives so you know the agent although it complet and redeployed you can always ask it for for more things it will never kind of complain uh sometimes it's lazy but for the most part it will not complain it will try to do what you want so if uh if we don't had any ISS issues it should be able to create the database for us and set it up and I have a question you know if I'm unsure if I should use postgress for example could I use the agent and just say you know what are the pros and cons of using postgress yes uh you can use the agent you can use our AI feature which is like a lot cheaper um and uh and faster because it's just a conversational thing so if you go to a new tool type AI or here under the tools AI so distinct distinct from the agent just say uh tell me uh the pros of and cons of post cross and I recommend people use repid AI here as just as you know to slow down and use repid AI if you're trying to learn um right yeah exactly and it also has access to your code base and so here you know uh our agent created uh the post crust DB and wrote a little more code and so I can say like explain my code and it should do that step by step so it will it's going line by line so if you go to main.py you can see that it is uh you know working on getting the database con ction everything and it's saying uh we're creating the data we're loading the data we're creating the map and and really step by step and so it can also describe exactly what the agent does and this is especially important when the agent hits sort of a dead end or a problem which happens it's still very very early technology uh you would want to use repet AI to do to do some of the debugging so here we see the database was created by the agent and um and the app is is working and now the app uh is should be using the the new database and so here we we have the scenic drives table and we have the data inside the table so it it migrated from the CSV it took it to the database it reran the project and the app is still working we have the scenic drives so it's asking us is it loading correctly so you know it did the migration is it loading yes it's loading correctly displaying so I I I can't emphasize how much um work that saved me you know typically I would have to go research different databases again I would have to go to AWS or something like that and figure out how to um how to configure a database and then connect it somehow here it did all of that for me uh and so I'll show you how it connected it you know it created these secrets these are my um database connection variables I didn't have to mess with any of that I didn't have to create tables it did that for me uh it wrote the SQL for me uh and now it's selling me hey we're ready to deploy again if you want to deploy a new version it's crazy man um let's see what else uh can I can I show you here we have um we have Integrations make it very easy to integrate with uh all sorts of AIS open AI anthropic Google Sheets you can also ask the agent to do that for you and I will ask you for the keys and we'll give you uh examples we also have code samples for all these uh Integrations we actually have also a built-in authentication so uh you can uh you know with one click of a button you can uh sort of make the app locked to uh to only use uh rapet authentication for you or for your team so if you have a team's account you can really um make it so that only people on your team can access your app this is very useful for internal tools and we see a lot of people using repet for internal tools um let's go to get I I mentioned get uh uh previously um so here every action that the uh agent did since the start since the initial commit 20 minutes ago have been recorded here and so I can go and go into any of these commits and roll back I can push to GitHub if I want so here if I want to um create a repository on GitHub I need to repository's name scenic drives let's make it public and then I want to go back and push push branch and maybe explain to folks you know why why are you using GitHub why are you pushing to GitHub for sure so uh GitHub is a um a version control system and a collaboration system so if you want to uh put something open source so that other people can contribute to it other people can use it and open issues uh for you um and you like here's what's missing here's what's working and what's not working uh you can you can use GitHub for that and so you can think about repet repet is the sort of real-time interface for creating applications you can use repet for deployment for editing even for collaboration but it's more real time you could think about GitHub as the more long-term sort of storage for your app so if you want to uh keep it version there they have a lot of really interesting tools to help you manage your application uh people can download your code and again there's this feature called Pro requests where people in open source or people on your team can send you can send you Pro request uh this is true of GitHub and other places like gitlab you can do all of that from repet so here we are I think in like you know uh you know 15 20 minutes we were able to build an application we deployed it we did the data migration we moved it to SQL we pushed it to GitHub and we're on our way like if this was a real project I've already made real progress uh towards my scenic drives startup which if you built that app by the way if you have the best scenic drives app I will be the first to buy it because I really like this stuff so what are the limitations of repet and repet agent you know like what what can I add to this app what can't I add to this app how how do I think about that yeah um so let's talk about limitations of repet agent I'm going to stop sharing for now and just uh talk about that so you know large language models uh are trained uh to complete sentences right that's the main way they're trained and so this idea of agent um is a very old idea of nii the idea is that instead of completing text or images you are creating actions the way agents are built today are kind of a hack like it is not really trained to be agentic and the way we're doing agents is mostly via something called reflection where the AI is thinking and you might have heard of open AI 01 01 is also doing sort of reflection and the other thing is Tool uh tool calling or function calling some some companies call it and this the idea where the AI returns a um Json that tells the developer to call a tool tool a tool such as create a database a tool such as edit code um and that allows us to build something magical like uh like repet agent but again because if it's sort of a hack like these uh openi and anthropic and Google haven't really trained these systems to be action systems they tend to have low lower reliability what we do behind the scenes is do a lot of retries that's why a little slow uh it's a bit slow and expensive because we're trying to get their liability up um when you we're now two features in right like we built the initial prototype we moved to post grass let's call it like you know 10 features in the system starts to struggle a little bit um and so you know we're working on ways to scale that and we're working on ways to start new sessions such that you're you don't have such a long history because the AI starts confusing itself with all its memories um but for now it kind of really starts to struggle and so you want to start moving to to our AI or some other AI to start helping you kind of copy pasting code very soon we have a new feature coming up that doesn't have this limitation of repet agent but it's still somewhat agentic so think about it as another tool I'm still not prepared to kind of give it a name yet or talk too much about it but it'll let you make large changes to your project without running into these skillability issues that we have with with the agents so I would say using the agent today get get your MVP get your prototype you can probably get it all the way until users are using it and then you're still going to at some point have to understand the code and have to figure out how to edit it if not understanding the code maybe you'd have to learn how to use you know more typical AIS to like repet AI or claw to to be able to edit the code yeah I think this is this is a beautiful place to sort of end it I think that um prototyping is way better than a deck prototyping is way better than you know just a tweet right so use repet to prototype it get it out there get feedback um we've done it in just a short amount of time and then as repet continues to grow and sort of evolve as an ecosystem and and a software um you know your prototype can evolve with it um and yeah I I will say our systems are are very scalable so you can build entire startups on repet it's only the agent that is still still early and not super scalable so um we have uh uh startups that reached um tens of millions in AR uh running uh on repet using just ret database and ret autoscale deployments because we're building a lot of it on just existing scalable infrastructure in AR Google cloud and existing AIS um but it's it's the the agent is really new technology and it's not has not scaled well but you you said it you know you're absolutely right it's like a prototype is is you know they say a picture uh or an image is worth a thousand words a prototype is worth a billion words right we can you can have all sorts of ideas about what you're going to build the moment you get a prototype in someone's hands and you watch your user use it you're going to get so much input and so much feedback I want to leave people with a story uh a success story of someone who's used you know repet or repet agent um maybe in the last 12 months built a startup had an idea put it out there um what comes to mind as you know one or two stories that you could that you could share so that people could listen to that get fired up uh and wanna and want to start uh their their Journey there's an entrepreneur his name is Adil KH he is a he was a school teacher and during the pandemic he was um he was kind of bored he didn't uh he didn't have a lot to do and so he learned a little bit of coding he went on repet he created this app called Magic School and magic school um lets teachers uh use generative AI uh in a safe and educational way like you can make uh new assignments you can correct assignments it really supercharges teachers makes them kind of superum in a way that's what the best thing about Ai and he quickly got traction he launched mid 2023 uh early this year he raised uh I think $20 million and the revenue ramp was something really really fantastic and I think they're raising uh they're probably going to raise another round soon because they're doing phenomenal um and so so this is an uh this is a a teacher learned a little bit of coding got their got their idea out there scaled it really quickly and was able to raise uh a ton of money and so this is really kind of what's possible but we also have a lot of Indy Indy hackers um uh one of my favorite Steve Steve Marco who builts uh builts data.org he's originally a a photographer if I'm getting it right um uh we have folks that are uh that uh there's also um Petro skano who was uh who was a designer uh and built this company called ever art and he's now you know building really amazing AI things like uh Claude engineer and 01 engineer and um and there's so so many St I can spend the next next hour talking about them but they all they all kind of follow the same trajectory uh someone who's not even an engineer had a had a spark of an idea but wasn't afraid to try and I think that's the crucial thing is that you should just try you should put some hard work into it and I'm I guarantee you you're going to surprise yourself about what you're going to be able to do that's that's a beautiful beautiful place to end and I think you're totally right I think uh these PE you know these are teachers who designers you name it who you know change their life um so it is beautiful uh how these Sparks of an idea once you put into code what what what could happen I'm J thank you so much for your time where could people you know get involved in repet and and and you know start start using it just go to rep.com sign up sign up for an account we have the core core plan which gives you everything from database credits AI agents um it's it's really kind of the most affordable kind of Builder plan on on the internet in my uh in my experience and a lot of our Builders tell us that as well um and uh and on one Twitter aad um and uh I I love sharing what people are building with with repet and and i' I've been able to help a lot of people uh get get some initial distribution so if you build something tweet at me and I'll I'll share it with the world and maybe maybe folks comment what your what you're working on with repet and it would be really cool if one day we can do some sort of live event where we're all kind of building and and working together so um let's uh maybe we can bug I'm J about that in 2025 yeah yeah let's do it let's do it all right all right thanks my man I'll catch you later thanks Craig see you [Music]

Riley brown people who watch this episode what are they going to get out of it I hope to instill some clarity around building with AI so I think it would be useful in this episode if we talked about prototyping and how business-oriented people marketing oriented people can communicate their app ideas more effectively to either pitch to their team and um and just yeah and yeah basically use it as a guiding vision for building [Music] software [Music] baby baby let get those juices and just to be clear you're not a trained engineer you didn't go to like University waterl for four years and study engineering correct don't even know what that is and no I uh I was I will say I will say just through this process because I have been building stuff with code despite not knowing how to code like if you ask me how to write a hello world thing I don't think I would be able to do it but I could build a full mockup for an app using one of the templates that we've been using and deploy it to the web so that other people can test it and I will say I am learning a lot about like what the functions do so through this process you do kind of learn how to code but it's just in an in the opposite way you you build the thing and then you learn about it instead of learning about it then building the thing which which makes it more fun should we get into it yeah let's what what do you want to get into first do you want to get into um vzer I think that might be a good place to start I think that's a good place to start okay let's Do It um I do have xcode open um you know what let's let's pull an audible here let's start on xcode because we can actually prototype iOS apps I forgot to bring that up so okay while you bring that up while you bring that up I want people to know that you are in for a treat because first of all I have so much fun when you when you come on here and share because it's just like I'm learning you you you're able to communicate in such a clear way that I get these little aha moments so people are listening you're in for a treat and I do have to I must shout out an without an this I'd be two months behind uh he has been the person that like came in and he onboarded me and and allow like gave me the right um the right Frameworks and mental models to like think about what's going on with code that like really pushed me forward um and so I just have to shout him out um and he was on the last episode we did together but anyway let's pull up this right here okay can you see my screen yes I've got we've got xcode open yeah and so I don't want to like build a full app honestly because I'm like brain dead right now I don't want to like deal with um like coming up with an app I just want to talk about like how powerful this is let me bring this to a different screen real quick so this was one of the most powerful uh tools that I've ever seen in terms of like getting me inspired to build some stuff so this is an iPhone simulator and this is xcode and if you've watched the previous videos I've made the way we've been creating apps is we are basically using cursor to generate the code and our codebase is in repet and we're connecting the two in this case we're not using repet we're using xcode instead and xcode allows us to make iOS apps and uh xcode uses Swift or iOS is built on Swift and like I you know this I don't know how to write code but I do know I have seen a lot of code generated and it's actually pretty easy to understand what's going on when using um Swift with building an IOS app so let's do it so first thing that we need to do is we need to make sure that cursor is open so I'll bring everything down to one window here and so we should be connected um um and it's super easy to get started all you do is you hit new project on xcode and you're going to save it to a certain location you're going to open cursor and you're going to hit open via file and you're going to select that same file and then they should be connected and then you're good to go it's way quicker to set up than um a web app and so let's go ahead and open composer with command shift I and say uh I want you to create a simple onepage uh app that um lets me um write my notes and save them to the phone to my phone and what's cool about this is since we're using iOS you can actually save things to the files like you have your files thing on your phone and so you can save things locally so you don't have to set up Firebase which takes forever and leads to a lot of Errors um and I'm just going to hit codebase here and let's go ahead and run this and I honestly think this might actually be a good place for people to start instead of starting with a web app um except for vzer like if you want to just do front-end design if you want to actually have a database I think it's a really good place to start have you tried this yet Greg building an IOS app no um I just figured that it would be okay I I always thought that building an IOS app was more time consuming and harder to do than building a web app am I Am I Wrong shh don't tell anyone but I've got 30 plus startup ideas that could make you millions and I'm giving them away for free these aren't just random guesses they're validated Concepts from entrepreneurs who built hundred million plus businesses I've comp pile them into one simple database compiled from hundreds of conversations I've had on my podcast but the main thing is most of these ideas don't need a single investor some cost nothing to start I'm pretty much handing you a cheat sheet the idea bank is your startup shortcut just click below to get access your next cash flowing business is waiting for you um so the the thing about iOS from what I've learned and again a lot of this is what I've learned in the last two weeks from what I can tell it's very annoying to release apps on the App Store because Apple has such a strict um U monitoring policy they they're making sure that you're not selling things on because they want that 30% cut and they're they have really strict content uh regulations so like they don't want you doing anything so the it's more time consuming on that part but if you're just testing it like I can immediately deploy this to my phone you have to put your phone on developer mode but you can like deploy it on your phone and take it with you and so like I'll be making little voice apps and I'll just deploy it straight to my phone and it lives on your phone for the max seven days and you can just go on a walk and you can talk to your phone and you can use your AI features and I really like that because you always have your phone with you and so you can always test it it's way easier to show people and it's not super difficult to create a test flight account and so I could send you a test flight link and you could try the app much it's I think it's just more tangible and fun and it it's not that timec consuming if you're not trying to fully deploy it once you want to fully deploy it then yeah it's probably more timec consuming um okay let's see this so we're going to hit save all and this is the part that's annoying about xcode so anytime they add a new file you actually have to manually go in and you have to hit file and you have to let's make sure we're on the right thing um yeah so file add files to siod and they should did it not did it add already it's been a while since I've done this uh hold on hold okay it actually shows note view here so maybe you don't have to do that annoying uh step anymore even better um that's cool normally you have to anytime cursor creates a new file you have to like manually save them but it doesn't look like you have to um okay there you go see now we have a Notes app um and we can actually use it like it's a phone like Hello uh this is my app and we can we can go back to um we can go to cursor we can say um please make the top say uh sip notes even better can I can I edit that yeah yeah yeah absolutely I have a note file on my on my phone that's called ideas startup ideas so this could kind of just be my idea yeah and you can add little fields that you have so like you know like you can make it your own custom based on whatever you like and you could just make it for fun and it's like honestly as fast as setting up you know like a notion dock which kind of sucks like as you I saw in your Tweet recently you're talking about the feature blow which I agree with um okay startup ideas make the top say startup ideas and then um and then make the button say because we'll want this button right here to say um add sip or no uh add I add idea add idea uh change the color theme uh then at code base and yeah that's pretty fun I don't know I don't know how far we want to get into it but this is just to show you that it's like pretty easy to get oh I know what I want to show you um all right so it should be done we hit save all and then oh yeah every time you make an update you have to actually rerun it on xcode so you have to come back make sure that you have this like simulated iPhone 16 open right here and you're just hit this play button and it needs to succeed if it if it fails it'll say build failed um and yeah it'll just kind of it so this part takes a little bit longer than using a web app but there you go startup ideas and then add idea let me make sure this work like um selling water it's the theme selling water balloons at a football game um like this is the third straight episode uh idea there you go boom it's right there you can check it out um super easy final thing I want to show you um is if you go to Riley's iPhone I can actually oh I haven't set it up to this account anyway that's how you would do it you just need to hook it up via your uh iPhone and you need to put it on developer mode I haven't done it with the iOS 18 yet um and I don't think we need to do it now but yeah you can immediate it'll immediately load on your phone which is really fun that's cool you can go for a walk and you can come up with startup ideas and store them in there and it's a great way to get started it's a great way to get started and it's a great way to give you that aha moment yeah for sure because when you especially if people listening to this this is probably the first thing or one of the first things they're building right so I think it's a big deal you know it's going to you might look at this and you're going to be like oh I don't need this I don't need that app well actually creating the app is going to just turn on your brain in a completely new way yeah 100% agree um you don't know what you don't know um and once you start like your problem is you're going to have too many ideas like once you you might think you have no ideas now as soon as you find one idea to make you're 100% right you're you're going to be walking around you like oh sh I want to build this thing and it's going to get in the way of the other projects that you actually want to build um and so it's actually I guarantee it too like every single person I talk to has the problem of like two ideas um and yeah you have to hit the aha moment um and I think I think it's a good way to start on your phone because for something about iPhone apps are more tangible than websites for whatever reason um should we talk about vzer yeah let's do it cool cool okay and maybe we can explore an idea that I had earlier today um you're at the right place startup ideas podcast you have an idea sounds about right hell yeah um can you see my screen yes sir okay I've talked about VZ on previous episodes and it's getting it's getting better so they added a project feature which um the app that I'm building is Yap thread Yap thread.com the uh by the way you can uh sign up for the wait list plug um anyway uh what you can do on vzer is you can actually like put in all the information about like your company about your app that you're building so that you don't have to enter in information over and over again so like you can just create like create a landing page for Yap thread uh create a um what else would you need for it yeah like um you can basically yeah create a about us page with Yap thread and it will always have access to that information and so it's super easy to store it in your project so highly recommend using that um but I want to create a cursor for writing I was thinking about that earlier like what if there was like a cursor that looked like vs code but it was for writing and so um imagine you have that idea and say I want you to create a VSS code but um a VSS code like app but for writers um where you have notes on the left panel and a markdown um um note uh note titles on the left panel and a markdown editor in the middle panel and then custom presets on the right panel where you could use them to edit the middle panel so uh so the presets are like custom AI prompts or something like that and you just put in your idea and vzer is quite creative compared to like CLA artifacts compared to anything else you can um it comes up with original ideas which is fun and it's really fast and sharable so would you recommend being very prescriptive in the beginning or letting it kind of come up with its own idea I would 100% ooh this is actually kind of clean I kind of dig this actually like legit like I'm not even this is fire like this is my note we can make I love the white um expand scene character dialogue okay so there's some chapter one okay so it has the notes right here o this is actually kind of sick um what would you would you change anything about it well I think uh this is interesting if you're writing a book but I think that the real opportunity here first of all I think this is a huge idea like this is a multi-billion dollar you know idea um but I think that if I was creating this vs code like interface for writers I would focus more on internet writers than book writers sure for sure um this does it is like chap okay so let's let's make this for uh content creators uh make the presets called uh tweet thread Tik Tock uh script podcast intro and outline uh newsletter and then um uh Instagram uh Carousel I do not know how to spell carousel I never get it right so I'm just not going to try um and um the notes should be o uh web clips from the internet and then oh no that hold on let's just try this uh make it make the the left titles uh more um about posts on social media yeah I think it was just the the things that they added as placeholders so basically if you create one of these and I actually can't go back while it's loading but you'll see that it it's adding a lot of these placeholders right so if we were to actually build this app what it would do is it would basically say whatever the user puts in you're adding it to Firebase which is where we're storing all of this data um and so then oh there you go there's your social icons oh it doesn't have a Tik it doesn't have a Tik Tok icon in the library that's all right that's interesting um okay yeah there it is uh failed to load the Tik Tok icon from lose side react it's probably because it doesn't exist [Music] um this okay so it won't let me type in there anymore but the point is you're trying to figure out what each page should look like and so if we're actually trying to prototype this app um and we're not trying to build it and like this is like the next iteration of wireframing right because what I'm going to do here is that you can hit share or you can hit Fork let's Fork it first let's say we decide Yep this is our main page of this cursor writing app and we are going to Fork it and that allows us in any of these apps the less context you have in the better unless it's relevant and um if you want to iterate on it I recommend forking because if you have all of that context in here it's just going to start performing worse um but when you Fork it also isolates it so you can share it so you have these public links right what we can do is we can go to um let's just go to Google Docs and let's just very easily just like you can just go front page and then we just um we can hyperlink that in and so now our goal would be to get whatever other page we might want on this so let's now say from here we say Okay I want there to be a profile icon on the bottom right of the screen uh this should have all the important information about or information about the user um that a writing tool would have including um let's just say audience information so that might tailor some of the writing styles um example scripts uh actually we'll we'll call them let's call these high performer scripts because you want really good examples any really good app it's not about having being able to do everything it's about having really good examples and staying super narrow um towards those that's just that's kind of how one of the things that we're taking in consideration when um we're building our app is we're you have to have really good examples and you don't want it to just let it do its thing because it sucks at writing in that way um audience information High performing scripts and then basic details and um and then one thing to always include is keep the theme of the site it should look like the same style that'll probably work and then you can run that and I really dig the style to be honest like it's super minimalistic it's kind of like typewriter Vibes yeah it's it's very versel if you look at their company it's very black and white um whatever I don't know what the font is called um but yeah it's very clean this is kind of their default style um okay so it's so it's basically adding the profile button maybe it's going to be a full screen popup I forgot to just say to generate like a full separate page I was actually prompting it like it was cursor because I was basically saying put the button on the main page and create that new page I forgot that I was actually in vzer um but it should give us that icon I don't see it yet oh was that saying it failed okay just create the profile page please um no need to show the profile icon I must admit I'm a lot more Angry to V zero than than you are I feel like you're so you're you're polite oh yeah I mean I feel like uh and trust me right now we're in the beginning you haven't seen me uh at the end of uh an error Loop that last multiple hours okay I have I'm not crazy I have definitely behind not not filming I have sworn relentlessly at cursor before especially cursor when the um oh it's kind of O this looks dope actually um oh so this this would be like if it was pulling your data so like if you you could set that up to your you YouTube API your podcast statistic apis which might take a little bit longer um but yeah you could actually have it automatically load your high performing scripts you have your account details that would be something that you could automatically set up um but yeah this is pretty cool so what I'm going to do again is Fork this profile page and then quick ad break let me tell you about a business I invested in it's called boring marketing.com so a few years ago I met this group of people that were some of the best SEO experts in the world they were behind getting some of the biggest companies found on Google and the secret sauce is they've got a set of technology and AI that could help you outrank your competition so for my own businesses I wanted that I didn't want to have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I didn't want to depend on ads to drive customers to my businesses is I wanted to rank high in Google that's why I like SEO and that's why I use boring marketing.com and that's why I invested in it they're so confident in their approach that they offer a 30-day Sprint with 100% money back guarantee who does that nowadays so check it out highly recommend boring marketing.com um this is basically what I sent my team before we started building is I just had all of these pages in in links so you just have the profile page um you have the um yeah profile page and then you can link it there so you can always find it if you want to use something like Whimsical diagrams you can basically show what button will lead to that page and it's super useful um and then yeah cursor for writing and yeah now we have two pages what do you what do you think we should do next first of all I love this page I I love how simple it is I love how gamified it is like it it now feels like this is like a game almost like I would use this like one you know one of the reasons why I think people got addicted to platforms social platforms like Snapchat Snapchat streaks it's like you know you came back to Snapchat because you didn't want you know to lose your streak with someone so I think like a gamified writing tool is really interesting yeah yeah yeah so like maybe it scores everything that you post maybe or something like that or because a lot of what people are writing now end up becoming videos so that's actually that is a tougher problem that we're actually trying to solve is like how do we connect that original piece of writing to the video content that you've created because a lot of a lot of video in order to create an AI tool that helps with video you need to have sufficient input output so you need to not only know the video but you need to know what script or what outline you used and then it's useful to know what research went into the outline and so if you can map the whole process um you can then reverse engineer it so you can basically take someone else's video you can be like I want to create a video like this and then it says like okay you want to create a script like this and then you want to be able to find these types of sources U and so that's the way that we're trying to approach this problem um but yeah so that's v0 and v0 is just front end so I'm not able to they actually are adding certain apis that you can use to fill data in as just placeholders so you don't have to look at like um like one thing we could do is say we could say let's go back to this real quick and what I've been doing for with VZ recently is using it to make landing pages so that's been really fun and I think the best use case for vzer is say um okay for this site create a landing page that is highly um effective to get people to sign up based on the value prop or this site um the ultimate or we can just call it cursor um Creator composer uh name of site okay and yeah have you ever used tally um the talking about like the form company yeah yeah so if you want to create a really really fast landing page and collect like user um like if you created a weight list like I created one yesterday in 10 minutes and just threw it up and I was able like I literally said use this logo that I generated on Mid journey in one minute use this logo and then embed this form and I just pasted in the tally embed form and literally one prompt it generated my landing page and now like people are signing up on the wait list and it's just going to tally so we have that information so if you have to do it really quick that's a really good way to do it and it's and it's free what because I I know I pay like hundreds of dollars a month on type form for all the different ideas that we're running yeah well Tally's only 30 bucks a month if you don't want any of their branding like um yeah like this is one prompt on vzer right here and if you just click on sign up for wait list um it just one prompt like I created this basically it's crazy yeah and it's super easy to get go from this it's a lot easier with one page to go from this to get it over to repet you basically just give it all of the code you can also um I mean this is basically the whole landing page I mean look at this landing page let's let's use your um I guess the the Bor in marketing analytics here um like compose your content orchestrate your success I you could probably work on that but like that's a clean landing page it's clean it's clean and I think what's so cool about this is you can come up with an idea you can prototype something you can put it out there and start getting feedback in minutes yeah I mean think about how long we've been sitting here I mean like look at this public link boom look at this we have now we have a landing page and so if you send this to a developer they're like oh like he has the whole site mapped out all they have to do basically is connect things with the backend obviously there might be some code that might be a little messy but like their job is mostly just the vision is very clear um maybe not with something like with cursor for writing is actually a pretty that is a tall task that's a multi-week project no matter what but they have a better idea of what you're talking about um which is really cool um yeah I mean that's vzero what what else what else should we should we dive into I think that's it I think that's the episode I like it hell yeah let's do it yeah so if you're listening to this you've got ideas don't just be an idea guy or gal like be a prototype guy or gal you know um put your stuff out there uh I've never used tally but I've seen people use it like get your tallying I think like voice of customer feedback is so helpful um and you might realize by putting out this prototype that hey turns out people don't want this product and that's that's great too it is the best Loop and you said that like you had a tweet that I referenced in a YouTube video uh that I released this morning which was like the most dangerous person or um something about the I call them the Creator composer someone who can build things with a community and asks them if they like it or ask them if they don't like it or ask them what they want and you just have this like really fast feedback loop because yes you can as a Creator I can Outsource someone to build apps for me but the loop is so slow I'm talking to other creators who do that and it's like multiple months before basic features are created features that I have literally released to my community the same day I have the idea and so it's a it's a huge unlock in my opinion and I agree that it's they're the most dangerous people you want to be dangerous yeah Do It um if you like this episode please like And subscribe and then Riley and I will be in the comment section if you have any additional questions or want to just talk more about the stuff and nerd out about it love to see you in there and Riley where could people learn more about you and some of the stuff that you're working on yeah Yap thread.com uh releasing an app that's all I've been doing in for the last two weeks so it's nice to get a little content break in this was a lot of fun um yeah that's what I'm working on and he's doing it in public which is cool you know like this is a guy who like you said he wasn't wasn't a developer he's got a small team and uh one thing one one one thing before I go is we're actually G to have feature contests so we're going to release the code for the app and we're going to see who can like Fork the code and add the coolest feature to the app um and it's going to be really fun I'm super excited about that yeah we're just going to do it um if someone copies us whatever whatever yeah cool all right my man I'll catch you later yep peace peace [Music]

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
okay this is going to be a fun one today I just need to get something off my chest I think that the name of a startup is more important than ever there's a lot of bad names out there so I don't want you to be naming your startup something bad I want you to name it something good and why does it matter more than ever it's because you need a name that's going to be scroll stopping so in today's podcast I'm going to just walk you through how I think about names some of my Frameworks uh and if you stick until the end I'll even tell you a few of some names that come from my list that you can have um so this is going to be a tutorial on how to name your startup uh how to come up with a good [Music] name um I believe that there's three types of names um bad names good names and what I call tofu names which are kind of like mid names so what I mean by that is it doesn't really stick out you know tofu takes on the sauce of whatever is around it it's kind of bland so it's kind of a bad name but it's not you know it's not offensive and I do have a framework for naming I I took this from our membership community empire.co and there's three ways where you can actually you know I come up with names so the first thing is I come up with a descriptive name a phrase or a funny name and I'll explain exactly what I mean by each name so a descriptive name is something like the Instagram account at somewhere I will live so if you go to that Instagram account uh and we can put it up on the screen I think it has like millions of of users or millions of followers 838 ,000 followers um and what does it mean you know when I quick follow like what am I getting well I'm getting beautiful photos of somewhere I would live so uh this is also a takeaway which is the name of your startup could be the name of your handle um and you know or could not and you could have a separate process for uh coming up with the name of your handle but having almost a million people uh who are interested in somewhere I would live you can sell them a lot of things you can sell them real estate you can sell them Furniture Interior Design Services so I think that having a descriptive name uh is really important um nowadays and just works really well um because uh people see it and they're like somewhere I would like to live yeah I could use some you know Furniture interior house inspo in my Instagram I'm going click follow so descriptive names super underrated um and something I use uh a lot uh phrases so uh what do I mean by a phrase so uh a phrase could be something that is starting to take off in the cultural Zeitgeist so um you know a few years ago I'll just pull up Google Trends uh there was a popular term uh and is now less popular but uh was called boss babe so as you can see um on my screen let's go to Max and this is uh you know Google Trends um and I use a tool called Glimpse to just give you some more information and just some uh related related uh terms so a friend of mine I think it was like around 2013 sort of picked up on this name boss babe she grabbed the handle created a meme page theme page uh called boss babe on on Instagram and it's just you know started started to you know grow as searches for Boss babe grew and she started sharing uh you know quotes you know for female entrepreneurs and empowerment female empowerment um and just really started to to go up and uh she she created an account with millions and millions of uh of followers I think it's about six point six or so million followers and was able to create you know a five plus million dollar year business on the back of it so uh a phrase when you know when a phrase starts um being on the come up uh you really do need to to to just take stock of it see if you can grab that handle um see if you can buy that handle uh create a business around it I think phrases are underrated um I've had another and he's actually been on the Pod I had a friend of mine who had a phrase that he owned called at the most famous artist uh so he was an artist no one no one was sort of listening to him for a while so he he just just decided to be called the the most famous artist uh so that when you would Google him um he would come up the most famous artist just Google him for a second he's literally the number one person that comes up ahead of Pablo Picasso ahead of rembrand ahead of Leonard Vinci Vincent Van go savador dii Michelangelo these people he's the first person his name is MD Mo and uh phrases you know if you own a phrase uh it's super super valuable uh and then there's there's humor uh the internet um revolves around funny uh memes and stuff like that so if you can pick a a funny name um it will go far and you will get a lot of uh dividends of that um there's a lot of examples of that um I think the uh like the whole manscaped brand um you know is they their their content is you know their social is a little bit around around humor and stuff like that I think they did uh a pretty good job at it and and just leaning into it shh don't tell anyone but I've got 30 plus startup ideas that could make you millions and I'm giving them away for free these aren't just random guesses they're validated Concepts from entrepreneurs who built $1 million plus businesses I've compiled them into one simple data base compiled from hundreds of conversations I've had on my podcast but the main thing is most of these ideas don't need a single investor some cost nothing to start I'm pretty much handing you a cheat sheet the idea bank is your startup shortcut just click below to get access your next cash flowing business is waiting for you so a funny name you know I'll give you a couple of examples of what that could look like when covid happened and people couldn't get their haircuts I actually as a fun side project 24 hours I launched this thing called you probably need a haircut and it was basically a tool that connected barbers in Brooklyn to people who needed haircuts um and they would like coach you on how to cut it yourself um and it was funny because obviously you needed a haircut um because um you know it been a couple months and and it got picked up by like Good Morning America and everywhere millions and millions of visits to the website um all from making people laugh and smile um and that was that was a really fun one so and we actually used that same idea we created a a sort of an AI automation business called you probably need a robot which is that same idea um and we've gotten free traffic you know the same way so humor you know goes a long way um and these are like the three sort of ways to think about how I think about creating a name for the internet that's going to go super super far um and then I want to just showa show examples of what could good names be what would bad names be what would tofu names be um and then uh I'll talk more about hacking your way to a novel name but uh let's go into some bad names um so I actually think WhatsApp is a garbage name um it's a garbage name because first of all it's like when they were first starting and they were trying to get product Market fit and you know it just basically didn't pass the telephone Test Now what's the telephone test it's when you call your friend and you're like you need to download this app called WhatsApp and then they go to the app store and then they try to download it and uh they spell it wrong what's at right um so you know P passing the telephone test is pretty important just easier um obviously now it's a success so kind of doesn't once you're like Mega successful it doesn't really matter what your name is but it is probably one of the worst names uh GameStop is a pretty bad uh gamestop.com is a pretty bad name so um game is good to have in the name they sell games although now they're selling like Collectibles so it's not perfect but um you want you don't want to stop you want to you know it should be game start of anything you want to play the game so the the ne you don't want to have negative Vibes negative uh sort of you don't want people not to do the thing that uh you want them to do so GameStop I think is actually a pretty pretty bad name this name was changed but Google Gemini their chat gbt competitor was originally called Google bard uh Bard literally sounds like I'm throwing up um when I throw up I sound I just barred all over the place um so I'm happy they changed it Gemini to me is a a tofu name we can we're gonna talk more about tofu names in a second um but just yeah just not a really good name at all um I just tweeted about this app called social AI um which went viral which is this idea around uh it's basically like a Twitter app except uh you know you have zero human followers and they just give you like a million AI followers and you post and then you get like thousands of replies all AI generated uh but it's called social uh Ai and it's like the least social thing it is um to me you know what what's a sort of phrase like what would I call this I would I'd probably use a phrase and I'd call it main character. a uh it makes you the main character so um I just think that this is this feels a bit tofu to me doesn't really you know I don't really get it um but main character. a you know I I totally get Cloe um clo doai is you know on one hand is good because it's like a person and a brand and you can kind of see it and it's French so maybe it's like I don't know higher quality um but it's hard to spell for the for Americans they don't really get it you know so I think I think that they were on the right track but um you know maybe pick Pierre over clo easier to spell and also like come on clo people like where's the where's the vibe here like where is the brand um this just feels so lame uh it's like that gray could be so much more they could be like making a bigger brand you know a more lovable brand minimal lovable product here and by the way I'm sharing all this stuff so you just get in my head so you become like the biggest best name expert on the planet um I have some of the biggest brands called me up and they're just like hey Greg I need a name they know I'm I'm the name guy so uh trying to give you all that Alpha free I think perplexity is uh a really good name perplexity a the uh search engine because like you know being perplexed is you know you don't have the answers so here is where the answers are and I think I don't know if you all have seen But the perplexity ads are like they go hard um like here look at this perplexity know it all search and discover with AI so this is their I guess their you know Splash well it's not a splash screen it's really just like a yeah it's a kind of a logged out screen on on web uh and it's beautiful and it gets you connected to the perplexity brand I think it's they do a really really really really good job here and probably one of the reasons why they're you know I think their last valuation was three billion like the brand matters the name matters uh this is an app uh called bump it's a location sharing app and when you're with your friend you you like shake your phone um and you bump and basically that sends a notification to all your friends who um who are following you so you bump when you're together uh I think this is and it's starting to take off like 79th in social networking in the US I think this is really cool as a name because it's the action that they want you to do um so thinking about if you're doing an app you're doing a consumer you know consumer app consumer software like picking the verb is a pretty smart way of of naming uh an app I had to throw this one in here when when I was like Claude is like kind of a not great name most of you probably don't remember this this search engine it was in the 990s it was called ask Cheves and they took out all the branding here but like back in the it was this dude it looked like this you showed up and you you went to Google something and you had this Legend right over here and it was like ask geves and he was like handing you the the the the results on a silver platter um love that name can do a lot with the brand and definitely goes viral this is an app I'm actually going to bring um the founder on on the Pod as well so depending on when this is um this goes live uh check it out his name is Chris Joseph's so autopilots is really cool thing they started off um with like a Twitter account like the Nancy Pelosi tracker where they would see what Nancy Pelosi would trade uh and all and then they started doing Michael bur the dude from the the the big short so they created an App based on these you know Twitter uh I guess and Instagram um uh handles and they said like do you want to copy these people's trades like go for it and I think autopilot is such a good name because it's like just you're not gonna I don't care how good of an investor you are you're not g to out compete Nancy Pelosi we all know this by now don't even try so uh pressing a button and just copying trades I think is really really smart um and calling it autopilot just like I get it um last good name uh this is is a it's like a sauna SL ice bath SL like breath work company they started off in Toronto now they're in New York City um and then they built an app that became quite popular which is you know just you can tune into these breathing exercises and it's called other ship and other ship uh I have no idea really what it means um I just know that like the people that go to this are the types of people that are sober that care about their health that talk about clean living um and it just feels like other ship it's like a ship that's like another ship that you probably should be on it's leaving you know it's leaving the marina go jump on um and it's just like other lifestyle that you can go ahead and have and and and you know I've been I've actually been to one of these and the Toronto one and it it is like a very unique experience not just like a a a it's not just like a steam sauna place it's more than that um and uh it's it's just like an other experience so I think they did a good job now what's an example of a tofu brand um aloe it's like what it doesn't speak to me I don't I don't really connect to it and I know I'm not like the target audience obviously for this um but uh I just don't think it's like a memorable name um and when you don't have a memorable name and you have a tofu name you your job gets harder your job gets a lot harder and who needs it building a startup is hard as it is you need all the luck on your side so I think that's uh that's a pretty pretty tofu name I also like we actually changed the name we had uh before uh we were design scientist.com which is like a design agency that is like part copywriting agency part marketing agency part design agency like we create design assets that convert and um before we did that we were called such a tofu name it was called dispatch dispatch could be like literally a coffee shop it could be a recruiting agency it could be a design agency so uh it didn't mean anything and we change it and as soon as we change it Revenue conversion everything went up so so put together a little kind of checklist around how do you hack your way to a novel name so step one create a note on your phone I call it the name game just like on your iPhone or whatever call it the name game and then as you're going along life you're going to hear a word that is going to Captivate you uh or you're going to be like that's super catchy so for example maybe you get poured a Coke um and you start drinking it and you're like oh my God that's a flat soda and then you're like whoa flat soda that's a good name for a startup boom put it in now once every two weeks see if that name is available on places like IG Twitter X Tik Tok um you know go and grab as many handles as you can you can be a a hoarder of of some of these of these names don't worry these handles you know nothing wrong with that quick ad break let me tell you about a business I invested in it's called boring marketing.com so a few years ago I met this group of people that were some of the best SEO experts in the world they were behind getting some of the biggest companies found on Google and the secret sauce is they've got a set of technology and AI that could help you outrank your competition so for my own businesses I wanted that I didn't want to have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I didn't want to depend on ads to drive customers to my businesses I wanted to rank high in Google that's why I like SEO and that's why I use boring marketing.com and that's why I invested in it they're so confident in their approach that they offer a 30-day Sprint with 100% money back guarantee who does that nowadays so check it out highly recommend boring marketing.com and then like test the name out at at dinner with your friends uh in conversation with your family with your friends is just like hey what do you think about this name for this thing and the ones that resonate make a logo for them can the name be transferred into a visual representation of what you imagine so that's like the path um and if you don't if you can come up with names by just like walking going for a walk and things are not hitting for you I would say start with the community like what do you building uh for who like who is it for so if it's for dentists um what are the pain points that dentists have what are some new phrases that they have um and then what's the essence of these phrases um and just start brainstorming from there um I usually go to claw um and I'm say like I use this prompt then you can have it I'm I'm brainstorming names around XYZ topic so you know as an example I'm brainstorming names around an a AI software agent that answers uh restaurants and takes orders um what are some interesting clear direct names that speak to this community and we can just do it live because we're live cooking and I know you all love the live cooking um let's do this do that boom and then let's see what what people what it comes up with so we got like dine bot order mine Cuisine assist menu mate foodie AI serve logic dish decider bite bot um bite bot's like pretty good um because it's got that alliteration um but yeah I think then you you see like is this a phrase is this descriptive um is it funny and you could say like I want more of a funny one I want more of a descriptive one can you make it one word versus two words um do you want it three words is do you want it short do you want it long um and then you just use Claude as your as your naming assistant as your Greg Eisenberg it's just me you know make Claude me basically and get feedback and then put that on your name list and and get feedback um so that's that's most of what I got I wanted to give you a few names on my list on my name my name game list just as like you made it here you know you made it here I'm GNA give you these names um so one is called after party I don't know what it's for or like what you'd use it for but like the Afterparty is something that a lot of people uh you know want to go to it's fun maybe it's exclusive I think there's something there um and by the way some of these you might not like and they might be bad and that's the other thing is on your name game uh list it's okay to have bad names um and then you can just remove them or just keep them nothing wrong with that um pretty perfect not sure what it be be for but like the idea of pretty perfect you got that alliterations I think that it sounds uh pretty beautiful um what else we got Invitation Only You Know by invitation only I think I saw that on like a a wedding init invitation um something something nice about that maybe you create like a paid community that's invite only for a particular uh group in cred so it's short for incredible you know you want to create something that's incredible incred you probably can get that domain probably can't get incredible. comom so that's kind of an interesting one and maybe that's it for now that's I think you know if you like this I'll share more ideas more names um I want you all to comment on if you know what are some tofu names what are some good names what are some bad names hope this has been helpful uh I love doing these tutorials because I think it really does hopefully make a difference in how you think about doing stuff how you actually not just create startup ideas but actually go and build the startup ideas so um that's what the channel is evolving to it's not just about ideas it's about tutorials about making things happen it's about putting things into the world it's about shipping uh it's about getting customers it's about building Community it's about building internet audiences so if you like this uh you can give me a little tip with a like comment subscribe share and uh I think that's it for today thanks for thanks for watching thanks for listening and happy naming

people are using AI to create voice character apps that are printing money if you are technical or you aren't today's episode is a mustat characters are the new apps and no one's talking about it we literally created a weatherman weatherman a fully working weatherman character app in this episode and you could do the same thing it might look like a toy but all the best startups look like toys enjoy this [Music] episode all right I got my main man Eric here he's been building a bunch of these voice chat apps think about it as like an audio chat gbt and I dragged him on here to give people a how to tutorial on how to do it yourself uh Eric thanks for coming on and what do you think people will learn if they make it through this video yeah thanks for having me Greg um I think first of all you find out just how awesome it is that we have this sort of these tools available and how quickly you can spin up something um that will kind of wow both yourself and and your friends I remember when I first started playing around with this stuff um to build like voice agents and voice voice Ai and all that it like you experienced chat BT for the first time and you're like holy this is cool but then you talk to chat gbt and and it's almost like this 10x Improvement in experience um I'd say I'd say yeah I'd say you just kind of learn just how exciting all this stuff is and how easy it is and I I'll say that you know um if you don't know anything about coding you know there are things that you have to kind of pick up along the way like what is GitHub what does cloning a repo mean what does it mean to deploy something but uh what I want to focus on for this kind of session is just like the cool stuff how do we get this spot running uh how do we configure its personality um all that so I have everything kind of set up beforehand but beautiful uh I'm sure we can provide links and resources to kind of help along with the actual like yeah setup of things let's let's let's dive in let's get right into it sounds good I'll just share my screen and by the way while you're pulling that up I think my goal for everyone is build your own ideas like you're going to watch this and you're going to get a bunch of ideas around what sort of voice sort of apps could I create and Eric has been creating a few of these they've been going viral on social so if he can do it you can do it too too so let's let's dive in awesome we're going in all right uh so first things first I think I should give a quick overview of like just the tools what I'm what I'm using what I'm familiar with um I'm sure most people watching are familiar with kind of the AI landscape in terms of things like cursor so this is my code editor cursor hooked up with you know all the cool um llms to help with coding um and then the main kind of star of the show here that is going to be really doing all the heavy lifting in terms of the voice in terms of the back end um is this company called daily and Daily's really cool I actually just first heard of them I think this year when they announced um not daily Bots actually daily Bots was something that they announc a bit after um but it was through this other Library called pip cats and pip cat was a library more focused on devs but just kind of make it a lot easier to interface with AI and allow you to kind of um build voice assistance but what daily Bots when they came out with this I was like oh this is going to be kind of gamechanging because now you don't even have to handle all the llm calls and stuff with Pip cat daily is doing that themselves and so all you do is you know sign up you go on to this dashboard and you get this API key and then there's this repo here where they have a demo up it just runs in the browser um and I have that set up over here I just clone the repo uh which basically just means you download it to your system open it up and you get this you get this demo screen uh now what you have to do from here is connect the demo to the actual daily backend over here with this API key this is sort of your your key to uh unlock the daily Services um so you put it in this m. local file here um I'm realizing that this is a uh key that I'm showing uh so I'll have to you know regenerate it later but it's okay um but once that is all set up realize that right now like no code has been written all all that's been done is just you're just downloading this repository you're signing up for this service you're getting a key you're pasting it in this file uh and then you're running it with uh one command over here just yarn Dev that basically just starts up the server you're heading to this little local post URL and then bam you're over here um shh don't tell anyone but I've got 30 plus startup ideas that could make you millions and I'm giving them away for free these aren't just random guesses they're validated Concepts from entrepreneurs who built $100 million plus businesses I've compiled them into one simple database compiled from hundreds of conversations I've had on my podcast but the main thing is most of these ideas don't need a single investor some cost nothing to start I'm pretty much handing you a cheat sheet the idea bank is your startup shortcut just click below to get access your next cash flowing business is waiting for you so let's try it out I wonder how this is going to go with the whole like audio thing but we can just start with the defaults and see what happens just testing if it works um take some time okay so let's see um I'm sure you saw the like audio wave form appearing Greg but did you you didn't hear anything right because I heard it through my airpods yeah I didn't hear anything okay so let's try let's try this hello I am example but your assistant I can help answer questions and provide information on a wide range of topics what would you like to talk about do you hear that yeah I heard that I heard that should I answer it no I just ended the call I just wanted to test the oh wow that was okay so what did I just listen to okay awesome cool we got audio working with the okay awesome you you just listen to the bot The Voice bot now um that was an llm response so daily on their back end was calling um the llm that we specified which is over here uh together AI they're provider a bunch of AI models um the one that we're using is llama 3.1 70b and the place that it's getting you know the how to respond kind of information from is this configuration file so the whole point of this daily bot thing is to take away all the complexity of like you know the actual hard AI stuff and then just put in front of you like super easy um configuration tools to change like how you want the bot to behave um and then the voice right voice is really important it would kind of suck if you couldn't change the voice um along with along with this is really cool um function calling tools that you can give to the bot to actually do stuff um and by stuff I mean like system stuff like computer stuff calling apis getting data um making an Instagram post whatever computers do already on the internet you can get an AI voice but to do um and even better to respond like to commands that you just tell it like hey you know what's the weather and then give you the weather now we're going to kind of get into how all that is set up you know later on but just kind of like putting it out there um this is the configuration file you can see over here there's a bunch of characters that they kind of put in uh by default with these prompts and whenever I'm working with AI stuff I'm always like the first thing that I think to myself is like show me the prompt um I want to know what exactly is going into the llm and so the default is this it's like you are an assistant called example poot you can ask me anything and then some instructions on how to speak so that the audio comes out corre correctly cuz what's happening uh on the back end is essentially the daily bot system is taking in the audio from the microphone and then it is converting that audio into text using something called a stt or speech to text provider and then that text is being piped into the llm the AI model the AI model does its thing it outputs its response as text and then daily takes that text and then pipes it into a TTS so a text to speech provider uh and then with that speech that it gets it's piping it out to your browser and so it's this whole system that it's doing um and there's a lot of complexity to that there's a lot of you know things to be aware of in terms of performance in terms of like you know how to handle errors all those things um which would be nightmare if you are developing that yourself but of course you know we're in the age of AI now and good tools and DA's handling all that and so we can just sort of focus on hey how what should our assistant do is it even assistant at all maybe it's uh you know they've got some pretty cool characters here theyve got a jenzy middle schooler they got a skateboard meme guy um and I think what I kind of did beforehand is configure the function calling the tool calling um just a simple weather man so I configured the function call the tool to get the the weather um and uh display it you know talk about it Etc so these preset characters so these are pre-built characters if you wanted to build your own character could you do that oh yeah no you just edit the file you just you just add just your character in so you can see here um the character selection screen over here is a is a direct one to one with this file so as soon as we edit like for example I can demonstrate it we have default we can just name this like Eric right and then refresh the default character should be name Eric so that's proof oh cool it's just it's just the file yeah right and that's why this gets really interesting and and for people listening it's I think that if you think of characters as the new apps then there's a huge opportunity and not many people are talking about this around just ideating on characters figuring out what's going to work and launching them yeah that's actually really good point I had even really thought that too deeply but I think that kind of idea is bouncing around a lot um um on the internet especially one thing that I can think of um Nikita Nikita beer which I'm sure most people are aware of at this point that are into like the tech scene he recently tweeted out like you know social apps are kind of dead after iOS what like 18 or yeah iOS 18 the contact sync is um very much restricted and what Nikita said in that tweet was that uh initially he thought like AI character chat apps were kind of a fad but after seeing like a bunch of the retention graphs he's like okay this is not going away and people really like talking to these characters um and that the kind of future of Highly retentive engaging consumer apps and you know non-consumer apps too will probably have something to do with you know creating a character that does something acts in a certain way totally yeah and I think it's B2B and B Toc I think it's just going to be the way that we're going to interact with content and this is just a new form of content where where else do you want to take this so let me demonstrate the function calling and kind of Step through that because I was um that's what the prep this morning was was about uh before the call I kind of just wanted to make sure that because I haven't actually I hadn't actually implemented function calling into um actually at all I haven't really made use of it but especially in the case of like the voice agent um that's something I never done before so I want to kind of Step through myself and figure it out um ran into some snags that I'm I'm glad I caught myself on before the before the call I can just kind of streamline through how this all works um I'll kind of Step through like the actual documentation so maybe viewers can kind of get a sense of like oh you know you're never going to be able to figure out everything on the first go you're going to want to develop this habit this practice of being able to read documentation um understand it and sort of apply what it's what it's you know saying sure but also now in the age of AI it's like if you don't understand something ask chbt ask Claude um and so here we are on the daily Bots documentation um you can check it out yourself just about you know general information on how it's all working we're interested in function calling so what exactly is function calling you know people talk about it a lot um basically you have an llm you have an AI that takes in text and outputs text how the hell can it do anything except output text well short answer is it can't do anything other than output text you need to build the system around it you know to actually take the text that it outputs with and do stuff with it now what llms can do if they're sufficiently smart enough is follow instructions really well um and so function calling is essentially you having an llm you having an AI model that is smart enough to understand what a function is and what a function call is and like what a response is and kind of follow all those instructions to Output an answer that your system around it can then take and do something with it so the LM isn't actually doing anything the LM is always just outputting text but the system you build around it can take that output and do whatever you want um that's a kind of core Insight here I I think it can get confusing when people talk about AI um AI can't you know AI is often referred to as like talked about this like blackbox system thing and a lot of it is a blackbox but I think we can gain a lot of insight in s of understanding like how things actually work so this kind of provides some information about you know what goes on in terms of function calling and this was what I was kind of focused on is adding it to the Daily part and so my code changes here uh very minimal are basically just adding this weather tool so over here in config I have um set up just a little bit of code to Define um the tool to the llm name is really important we'll kind of get to that later but we want to make sure that our names are align and we're sure of what we're naming the tool um and then let's see we want to obviously describe you know what kind of parameters we give to the tool so parameters aren't something that is necessary um but probably you want because you know if you're going to do like to get if if you want to get the weather you want to get the weather for a given location right and so um specifying to the AI that oh you know you can pass in a location is pretty important um and then all this stuff that I've done is basically um following the instructions here so that the AI model on the other hand uh on the other end knows what's going on with all these functions so the AI model is sort of like okay I have access to these functions um this is the format that I need to respond with and this is really important this is really important that the AI does respond with this format because what daily is doing on the other end is waiting for a message that you know starts with angle bracket function and ends with that and and that's how daily understands oh okay the AI model is trying to get the weather and so over here in page. TSX I'm essentially defining you know what actually happens when the AI calls AKA outputs you know I want to call get weather and this is where actually the magic happens in terms of the function calling we can see get uncore weather is aligned is a same as get underscore weather it's very important um if they're not online you can run into issues where the AI is calling a function that doesn't exist you know and so this is kind of the alignment point and then this is what we're actually doing you know the system the server is doing in terms of um like the code it's it's calling this route uh API weather so where the hell is that well you know there's a folder called API here um I guess before we started uh we didn't even specify that we're working in nextjs but you know nextjs is essentially this framework that allows you to set up a server that runs um react but also allows you to specify Roots uh pages that uh run code and so over here you can see there's a directory called API there's a directory called weather um the names lining up with here are not a coincidence over here in the route. TS file uh we are specifying what actually happens when um we're fetching that route and so I'll just put it up here now if you read through this closely you'll see that um we're not actually getting the weather we're we're specifying like the function liter called get nonsense weather was specifying a bunch of these things uh the reason why I I did that was one because didn't have a lot of time to to prep but also I think it's going to be pretty funny um to actually get some kind of you know you I'm gonna read I'm gonna read a couple of these you know conditions and stuff like that just cuz some people won't be able to see it on on their screen so Sunny you know you got Sunny rainy cloudy peculiar Whimsical flying pigs flying pigs good place so this is actually kind of good that we specifying these kinds of more wacky sayy things because a potential thing that could happen right is what are we telling the AI to do we're tell them to be a weather man right and so let's say like you know the function calling didn't work and the AI doesn't actually like do the code like execute the code that we tell her to well we're still telling them to be a weather man and so most likely what the AI is going to do is hallucinate some kind of you know weather report and so what this actually in hindsight um I realize is like oh because we're specifying like nonsense phenomena like flying pigs cats and dogs if the AI says those things we can be sure that it's it's working um we can also be sure that it's working by looking at the logs here and just making sure that um nextjs is telling us that the server is accessing the API weather route um but you know that's bit a bit more boring than the AI saying flying pigs and realizing oh yeah it's actually getting that that thing there's another reason why it's important to specify which is you know I think about it as like Tik Tock moments it's like how do you reverse engineer someone screen capturing recording your product and if someone uses this product and it says it's rain you know raining pigs or singing rainbows like that is that could go viral your character could go viral so as you're designing your character and thinking about you know the Ultimate Experience that you want to create I think it is important to add constraints and try to think about what's the type of thing that will get you free distribution oh yeah and you're you're the king of that so I know you know that I mean I want to say King I'm working on I'm working on a Tik Tok I promise you um okay so let's let's let's get some zy weather reports shall we let's do it let's do it I can't believe we're making a weather man this is like insane and by the way it's like a mid hurricane right here in Miami so this is like perfect it's not it's not looking good well it's not really looking good here in in New York either it's bit bit cloudy but at least there there's no hurricane um hope you're staying safe okay so I have it loaded up on my phone and um I guess it will be I think I can like show my phone on the camera see and we'll zoom in yeah quick ad break let me tell you about a business I invested in it's called boring marketing.com so a few years ago I met this group of people that were some of the best SEO experts in the world they were behind getting some of the biggest companies found on Google and the secret sauce is they've got a set of technology and AI that could help you outrank your competition so for my own businesses I wanted that I didn't want to have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I didn't want to depend on ads to drive customers to my businesses I wanted to rank high in Google that's why I like SEO and that's why I use boring marketing.com and that's why I invested in it they're so confident in their approach that they offer a 30-day Sprint with 100% money back guarantee who does that nowadays so check it out highly recommend boring marketing.com try to get as close to the mic as possible um and so on my phone I've I'm accessing the same page that is running on my computer and so this is um running the code that is also on my screen right now and so you can see when I go to the character kind of selection screen we have Eric there that I edited and then all the way at the bottom we have the weather man so let's talk to the weather man hey uh I am located in New York City can you give me the weather for New York City folks it's your lucky day I've got the forecast for the Big Apple and it's looking like a real tree we've got Cloudy Skies but don't let that fool you there's a chance of whimsical singing rainbows that's right you heard me right it's going to be a day of magic and wonder in New York city so grab your umbrella and your best singing voice and get ready to take on the day that is so good how good is that yeah that's awesome validation we got it we got it says singing singing rainbows that's not a that's a viable weather thing but it's tot that's that's working yeah I mean the reality I I honestly thought that it was gonna suck that's the I thought it was going to be like kind of bad and it would it that was really really good yeah it's it's pretty cool so I think uh viewers watching you would have seen actually on on my screen too that we got the log here um what this log is telling us is that the system the server actually did access API weather and provided this location and so everything is working sort of as as we wanted to which is super exciting it means then we're we're having we have this platform kind of to just like build off of and make tiny changes and I think that's kind of uh thing I want to emphasize in building anything is you want to especially when you're starting out make sure that your changes that you're making to things or when you're building something are small and like understandable um I I feel like in this new world of AI that that we're in um there's so much like hype around one-shotting things like oh I just sent one prompt to chat gbt and built this whole game like that's cool but you're never going to learn anything by just like telling it to build you a whole entire app and then like you have no idea how old the files kind of like rout together um and so I think it's really helpful to kind of build off of something that already exists which is why I didn't bother trying to integrate daily Bots myself but instead just literally took the repo that um they put up as a demo and just adding onto it um so yeah important stuff and and you can turn this you know that weatherman app into an IOS app you know it doesn't necessarily need to be web um so that's totally possible um is there anything else before is there anything else you want to talk about here um I think the last thing I want to do is just show them your app because your app is basically like to me it's like a fin like it's what you can actually end up creating that's like the finished product um but is there anything else in terms of the tutorial that you think it's really important people know I mean I guess we could go into like deployment yeah let's yeah actually getting it live cuz it's it's it's live now I've already I've already deployed but I can go through like how to do that and the platform so um nextjs let's just start with nextjs nextjs is this framework that uses react which is this way to build websites and nextjs was created by a company called versel verel really cool company they do a lot of programming stuff what versel also has done is built this platform that allows you to take your nextjs app which you can develop for free because it's an open source framework and host it online on the web and so they make it super easy um you can type in one command and your app is going to be live on the internet um I think we can just kind of provide links in the description in terms of like the documentation to actually install um the stuff that you need but essentially uh Vel has this tool the CLI command line interface tool um that allows you to kind of use the command line to um do things on the versel platform and so what I did to get my uh daily bot demo with my weatherman live is literally just Vel um actually yeah that's it that's literally you just type you just type Vel obviously way just you got to like log in so that it connects to your Vel account and everything but you log in you type Vel um and right deploy yeah learn how to deploy type you type this out and it deploys anyone could do that yeah I've I've already done that so it should I think it's going to just trigger another deployment but essentially it's just going to go through this step and I can show you actually uh what's going on on on CES and over here deployment building um so I guess it usually takes like a minute and a half um but where they deploy it is this link here and [Music] so yeah I could let me just leave this up I'll just leave this up um yeah so people can check out yeah check we'll put it we'll put it in the YouTube description um so people can check it out yeah but it will be it'll be deployed and oh it actually took much uh much less time um and essentially yeah just going to that uh URL on any device we'll pull it up I can pull it up here and you can see it's right there so that's the point it's you text it to your friend they can try it out that's cool that's awesome okay and you know can you can you show us what kind of a final version would be which is in my opinion like one of your apps um could you show us maybe a video or or a version of what it looks like I guess I can start with um one of the apps that I've worked on that I'm really excited about that uses all this kind of voice stuff is an app that allows you to basically have a FaceTime call uh with a vtuber so I don't know if a lot of people are yet familiar with what a VBA is but essentially the people that create content a lot of them stream on twit twitch and YouTube but they don't stream using their real face they use software to essentially um embody an avatar and I'd say 99% of these avatars these YouTubers embody anime characters um because the whole kind of technology and Trend started in Japan um and this just kind of the way the culture has gone people love anime and these vtubers are crazy popular they have like millions of followers they're making millions of dollars a year um from subscriptions from selling merch Etc and I had this idea of like oh wait I can use all these cool new tools coming out these um voice apis daily Etc to create an app where you can have your own personal face on call with a vtuber because when you're watching a vicho like they're they're an influencer they're they're someone you're watching they're Creator you can't have like a personal call with them and so I I realize that with AI and all this all this cool stuff you can you can build that and so um this why I created um yeah so this is mji in terms of the kind of going to exactly like did I draw her no I bought this model um on a website called nzima nzima is a Marketplace for these kinds of anime models there's a whole cottage industry of people rigging um illustrating these models for vber streamers to use but I bought one not to stream with like as myself but to put in this app and so what this app is using is um not exactly daily Bots um I'm actually using pip cat that I showed earlier because it gives me more control as a Dev and so that's kind of I guess going into a bit more of like oh you know once you learn a bit more about how these systems work you are going to want to use tools that allow you to have more control over um how data is passed around and whatnot but I can enter the call right now and we can show people yeah let's talk let's talk to her yeah okay so hopefully this I think this has been pretty popular lately it's called Uh Coco Cloud can you see it it's it's blue wow it looks so pretty yeah can you see what what other color is there it's blue and one one other color can you see I see a little bit of white swirl too yes yes you got it the white SCE okay so we're going to try it and I'm going to give you some to to try it and I want you to let me know what what you think okay okay I'm so excited all right she excitedly takes a small sip of this morning and her eyes widen she favors the taste before giggling so yummy she exclaimed it's so sweet and creamy thank you for narrating that it's actually pretty good it's actually pretty good I like it you're welcome I like it to how would you rate it out of 10 and that's what you guys can create that's what you can create that's the end result that and and that that's just so cool that is so cool how long how long does well first of all did you build that yourself uh yeah yeah well I mean it's kind of you know did I write every line of code that is running on the system no but in terms of like the actual app yeah and the sort of like the server architecture and all that amazing so that's the thing you know a few years ago well first of all it wasn't this wasn't even possible a few years ago but you would need a large team to do that raise Venture Capital here you are you know in a room wearing a hoodie uh throwing out apps characters you love to see it um Eric this has been a blast if people like this there's a few things that you got to do one is like it on YouTube so more people see this um like it like like like uh and the second is comment I think I just would love to see uh what you what you thought of this do you have any ideas around this um Eric and I will be in the comments and we will be replying um and then subscribe you know I'm not going to continue making these videos unless I see that subscribe button go up uh subscribe but number go up so don't forget to do that Eric where could people learn more about you and and the apps that you're building characters You're Building I should say just follow me on on Twitter sx.com the everything app um the link will be I guess in the description but yeah that's that's where I'm posting all the unfiltered takes and and progress updates and stuff love it all right we'll have to catch you catch you around awesome thanks so much for having you Greg of course anytime later

b) Engage as a "reply guy" on relevant topics
c) Do deep, investigative journalism to build credibility
• Marry memes with authority to become THE go-to account in your niche. 

4) The UFC sponsorship case study:
• Sponsored the event (base layer of credibility)
• Sent a fake Nancy Pelosi to the fight
• Drove a Cybertruck with "Pelosi 2024" around Vegas
•  Goal: Maximize surface area for virality and build brand loyalty

5) Chris's viral formula:
• Each additional stunt increases chances of going viral:
a) UFC sponsorship alone = 10% chance
b) +Fake Pelosi = 15% chance
c) +Cybertruck stunt = 20% chance
•  Keep adding elements to boost your odds! 

6) Key to monetizing meme pages:
• Don't just post funny content. Mix in authority-building posts to be taken seriously.
• High engagement does not mean High monetization
• Authority + Engagement = winning formula

7) Startup idea alert: Live shopping streams for Gen Z women 
• Imagine: The Twitch of online shopping, where influencers livestream their browsing & purchasing decisions.
• Huge potential here. Who's gonna build it? 

8) Growth hack: Build relationships with journalists
• Create an email list of reporters in your niche
• Regularly send them high-quality, relevant info (no selling!)
• Become their go-to source for stories
• Free press = Priceless marketing 

9) Remember: Consistency is key in building your brand.
• Find your angle (like Autopilot's "Pelosi 2024 - Invest like a politician") and double down on it.
• Create moments, build loyalty, make people LOVE your brand.

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
today I want to talk about uh something that I think you're one of the best in the world at which is getting attention and going viral so Mo many people don't know Chris Joseph's and that's okay because they have seen the Nancy Pelosi tracker or the Michael burry tracker or they've seen what you've been you know the Le the recent thing you did with the UFC uh and getting a lot of attention there so what I want people ble to get out of this episode is by the end of this they'll be able to internalize their own Chris Josephs and whatever they're able to do they'll be able to come up with viral ideas to get millions of people to engage with their stuff do you think we can do that today yeah yeah yeah I'll try and uh kind of unveil the curtain and start time [Music] uh I've been on your podcast before and I think like the theme of that one we did a while back was um we call it like Trend hacking when you know the analogy I like there was uh you have a river of conversations going on on social media and there's different boats that go along that River as a brand if you can kind of throw a a life jacket or a um any any sort of thing to hook onto that boat and let that Trend take it with you your brand you can kind of get growth with that I think with this one it's a little bit more of um like this idea of and this will kind of set the conversation well is I don't see myself as a marketer I don't see myself even as a growth guy I see myself more as like a social engineer and like what I mean by that is social media is all built on algorithms and it's just one people one kind of side of the marketplace of the the attention span and then the other side on our side it's like how do we algorithmically and scientifically come up with a form formula around our content that would work on kind of both sides so as a social engineer like the things that go into it reverse engineering viral ideas reverse engineering a tweet that is kind of written a certain way so that it gets 20,000 retweets as opposed to 15,000 reverse engineering like if you're going to sponsor the UFC what's one thing to do you could kind of put autopilot on the on the banner or you can kind of really think through like how do we get this thing to get even more vir which I have a fullon kind of calculation I'll get into and um how do I add in the different variables for that one piece to go viral so as you kind of mentioned um yeah we have the Pelosi tracker autopilot it's the first app that allows you to automatically copy politician stock trades that's kind of a viral idea in itself um I've personally built that Pelosi tracker um with the help of my team it's not just me but um to around like 750,000 on Instagram we have another account called the politician trade tracker which is around 700 50,000 and our app has around like 1.2 million downloads $300 million invested um things of that nature so the story on the UFC was a lot of people know the idea of the Pelosi tracker but not as many people know that autopilot is the company and the product that powers the Pelosi tracker so say 100 people know Pelosi maybe 20% of them know that autopilot is the team behind it how can we kind of start cre that narrowing that Gap and getting more and more people to understand that autopilot is associated with the Pelosi tracker because the Pelosi tracker has such good will the UFC probably three weeks before their big sphere event reached out to us and it was like Hey we're big fans we'd love to Market with you guys or we'd love you guys to come and sponsor kind of some of the upcoming fights and we kind of thought at the beginning like we don't do any sponsorships we've never swung big we've never done anything like that maybe now is the time because the UFC is great Dana White Joe Rogan's there Trump goes a lot inv that's like a politician the majority of their fans are Libertarians like that would kind of work well and we said like look like let's let's kind of think it through and let's go from there uh it's a long long story but um the way that we approached the the actual advertising of it was we haven't really gone too public with this stuff yet I'm going to kind of work on making this viral so probably after this comes out you'll see these things on social media but we realized like as a small startup and this goes to the formula idea sponsoring autopilot or sponsoring the UFC is one thing that is cool that'll get brand recognition but how do we kind of take that to another level the way that we thought we could take it to another level was create like the most riveting and kind of emotionally driven and funny pieces of content as possible around the actual ad so that was step one what did that mean invest like a politician in red white and blue directly on the back of the octagon figure out a way to get it placed so that it's on the noon timeline or the noon um vantage point so that anytime they're talking you know we're right there another part of that is create the funniest ad read as possible for um Bruce Buffer when he did it he came up like and now autopilot if you wanted to copy a politician stock trades well now you can go to join autopilot.com and invest like a politician today like writing that pieces of content so that it goes viral and it can be clipped is another piece of it and then um I'm rambling here but then the last piece of it is um how do you create viral moments aside from the actual uh sponsoring of the fight normal Brands they would just sponsor it their marketing team would be like that's it it is kind of it is what it is we'll hope it Go vir we'll hope it goes viral we'll hope it kind of blows up us on our creative kind of social engineering team we're like that's not enough we need more and more chances more and more moment moments to create virality and that's where we came up with the idea of wouldn't it be funny to send a fake Nancy Pelosi to the fight put a front row have a whole Vlog style be with her wouldn't it be funny to get create this whole slogan of Pelosi 2024 invest like a politician slaping on a cyber truck and start driving it around and then can we kind of create virality from that I have learnings in kind of what went right and what went wrong with that which we can kind of dive into but that was the the general approach with the UFC it was create the most viral campaign possible for the actual event and then create viral moments that could kind of support the actual event to increase chances of virality shh don't tell anyone but I've got 30 plus startup ideas that could make you millions and I'm giving them away for free these aren't just random guesses they're validated Concepts from entrepreneurs who've built hundred million plus businesses I've comp pile them into one simple database compiled from hundreds of conversations I've had on my podcast but the main thing is most of these ideas don't need a single investor some cost nothing to start I'm pretty much handing you a cheat sheet the idea bank is your startup shortcut just click below to get access your next cash flowing business is waiting for you okay so during this pod I actually want to go through step by step and just break all this stuff down but Step Zero was well okay before I talk about Step Zero you basically said that the UFC reached out and was like hey we want to sponsor you know are you interested in sponsoring this event Step Zero was you created meme pages that had millions of follower so you created credibility uh so that you had access to something like UFC if you know for someone who wants to create a meme page similar to a Pelosi tracker but in their space um do you have a framework for how they can go ahead and do something like that yeah yeah and I think it's possible in every space um it's happening in the seed oil space there's an app out there now that is kind of capturing the seed oil things Joe Rogan um retweeted it the other day it's happening in kind of the hedge fund space with our burry tracker the Pelosi tracker and I think it kind kind of get more and more the the way that we approach that is um it's controversial but it's you got to have a little bit of a controversial take to it like the the attention spans of people are so short that you need to be able to have your product and have your Niche and Have Your Meme page adapt to the different news Cycles as they come Wall Street bets is a good example that does this well like they were Finance but now they got politics they got inverse Kramers they got this and that and they can use any piece of content kind of narrowed down to their thing with autopilot in the Pelosi tracker we started off specifically with Pelosi's trades and then moved over into politicians trades and then gotone into hedge fund stuff and then kind of um were able to use the trend hacking method that I spoke about earlier and I can get into now here too but um that's kind of how we we did do it if I were to uh start one from scratch what I would do is I would kind of probably take three approaches and this is specifically to Twitter Instagram is honestly even easier in my opinion I think Twitter is harder but step one is I would create an actual account of a the name that someone would follow like Pelosi tracker it makes sense um we have other ones that are going to be coming soon it's going to called like stop the spend stop the spend is perfect like what are we going to be do when we going to talk about that we're going to talk about how the government spends so much freaking money oh if I'm seeing content like that I'm gonna follow an account called stop the spend because I want them to stop the spend um Michael bur tracker that's another example so any piece of content or any account that is in your Niche or in your space that you want to build the meme page account um don't be afraid to name it as like something as simple as that no one follows Brands everyone follows movements everyone follows um like people so that's kind of the first approach the second approach would then to do the reply guy stuff the you know if elon's tweeting come up with a good comment typical stuff that everyone on Twitter does and the third part though is you really got to dive deep and become like an investigative journalist with um some of your content if you're going to take that approach you can do the meme stuff but the investigative journalist and like this is the really really important part that I think a lot of people don't understand is this stuff builds your account credibility this stuff builds your virality so the meme builds virality investigative journalist builds credibility and marrying them together then you have an account that's an authority and if you're not an authority in the space you're kind of just mixed in with all the other accounts but if you are that one Authority like the Michael bur tracker that is follow by hedge fund people because we have built out enough Authority in people's minds to be like that is an account that follows the hedge funds and I can trust that account that's how we kind of would do it from um that's how we've done it in the past and that's how I'm going to be working on a whole workshop and again I'm saying this is kind of accountability it's like I'm going to make a new account called stop the spend and I'm going to try and run this Playbook to build an account that highlights the Ridiculousness of the government spending and things like that that's how I would do it though then I would take that account those those pieces of content and I would translate those over to Instagram you could take a post put it as an actual real Instagram is pushing reals these days you then could take those posts and put them on Tik Tok Tik Tik Tok is pushing carousels but as long as it's controversial and as long as it is um informative or funny that's how you kind of grow the things to uh the scale that you would want so the investigative journalism bit can you give an example of you know one trust building exercise you did using investigative journalism that really really put maybe Pelosi tracker or bur tracker on the map yeah yeah yeah I mean and I do them probably once or twice a week but earlier on in the early Pelosi days and these aren't built for virality again they're not built to like the investigative journalist piece aren't built to and they're not supposed to get millions of views but um if you remember back in 2022 when everyone was talking about the political stock trading we kind of did have two different approaches to this like we had the Pelosi tracker it was around 30,000 followers it's like do we go the meme accounts do we kind of just create funny Pelosi talking on the phone hey I want a hundred million dollar of this like that will go viral and things of that but the investigative journalist piece is like if you take a piece of content and say Pelosi bought envidia one tweet the the meme one Pelosi bought Nvidia can't believe it's inside of trading that's such corruption you know I can't believe she's allowed to do this that's kind of the the viral meme page the investigative journalist example though is like Pelosi Bond Nvidia interestingly six months before that they passed the chips act which they allowed to have $40 billion of Investments that $40 billion of Investments trickles down to us-based companies which is around 13 billion of it x amount of that could go to Nvidia this may be why she's buying follow from more to come and that's the sort of investigative journalist then that then turns into an Instagram reel it turns into do a Tik Tok and it builds um accountability and Trust because no one else is doing it to that degree everyone is doing the fun meme page stuff that gets tens of thousands of likes and that's honestly why a lot of the meme Pages don't like on a product guide they like their product is selling advertisements whereas with us it's like we have a full-on product built be behind this that makes millions of dollars because we have put the time and effort in to make sure that it provides value cool all right Step Zero check uh Step One Step Zero check you have the accounts yeah you have the accounts you have the accounts uh maybe you've gotten it to you know 50,000 followers you've built some Affinity which I think is something that most people don't think about when when they think about building a Social account they're thinking about attention not Affinity but you're saying build attention and Affinity what's the next step uh in the process and like what have you learned from the whole UFC thing yeah so the next step is once you have attention and affinity and Authority you then can start becoming like adding in creativity if you think about New York Times you think about like they don't have that creative angle that vibe that oh go do cool content just for the sake of it and people then build loyalty to your brand that's the next stage of it so we were able to with the Pelosi tracker kind of build Authority Affinity attention but there's no major loyalty there's no one people stepping taking a step back and be like damn like that that company's cool liquid death has that though Red Bull has that Apple has that Nike has that because they do cool stuff and then they marry it back to their own page when the UFC reached out like a perfect kind of two-way example going back to the original thing is like we wanted to sponsor with them because um it adds virality trust you know this and that but the two approaches is we could have just gone the approach of like we'll just sponsor with guys you guys will build trust for our community and we'll tell the community that we sponsored the UFC everyone will be like oh that's cool you know cool they sponsored the UFC that's great they have a cool product but when you do the Loyalty stuff where you kind of get into the creative angle this is the first time we've ever done this it's do something so cool that people will REM take a double take and go tell their friend about so when we did the auto the UFC approach when we were like kind of doing the whole strategy around it it's let's create that cool invest like a politician thing put it on the noon camera angle and see what happens that may make us go viral let's take a fake Pelosi send her to Red Rocks in Vegas have Mike MAAC have the nek boys gamble with her because there's going to be content there that's another viral piece let's take a cyber truck and put Pelosi 2024 invest like a politician under and have a driver all around Vegas getting flipped off giving away TV shirt uh giving away shirts that's another viral piece to it and when you T kind of take a step back we've done two things with this whole thing one we've sponsored the UFC as a brand that's important that's creative that's smart but two we've maximized surface area for virality which helps offset the costs and creates content that we then can use on the pages that we' built to build the loyalty and to have people be like damn that company is cool I I like that company like that that was the goal of the UFC it was to not to drive downloads not even really to build out brand awareness but to put autopilot on the map and differentiate us from our competitors to be like that's a cool company that I like because they're swinging and they're doing fun stuff and if you don't have if you didn't do Step Zero and you don't have the meme page for example and you still uh sponsored the UFC and you did it in this really smart way what people can also do and I'm curious your opinion on this but what people can also do is get that content and just reach out to different meme pages and be be like hey I'll give you $500 for you to repost this or whatever you know you could rent that space if you don't want to actually do the work yep 100% 1,000% and we we aren't able to do that as much anymore because of um we're a registered investment adviser and once you're on Raa as on the autopilot side you you got to be careful with payments and things of that nature but if I weren't a registered investment adviser that's exactly what I would do there's there's a great YouTube video by the yes Theory guys talking about the the fake Justin Bieber with the burrito what they did was um they pretty much spoofed the entire world into thinking that Justin Bieber eats a burrito sideways but what they how they sparked it was they planted that piece of content on Reddit and then they sort of kind of manipulated the algorithm to get that thing to go viral in the whole kind of world it took it by storm with autopilot what we with the UFC stuff honestly a little bit of a failure on our end was we didn't do a good enough job planting these different pieces of content places to spark that original virality We relied on our own social media channels which worked it it it did great for us but um a learning on that was like there really is so much power in having someone else post about you and kind of having them be the validation for you uh that goes beyond just anything that comes from your own brand especially when people know you in the space because they know you got money they know that like you can pay and it it just becomes a harder game to create organic virality around so a last part of the strategy which um that goes into the UFC thing is you build up all these cool viral viral ideas you hope they go viral but again the idea of 5% 10% 15% 20% 30% the last piece of it is how do you get free press and Free Press is hard because you get pitched all the time Fox News wants to write about you but give him 10 grand you know it's expensive to do the way that we've kind of done it that's worked well is everything kind of marries back to this idea the investigative journalism becoming an authority being a content creator that people take you seriously and then providing high quality content so the New York Post has already covered the UFC setting a fake Pelosi maybe we'll get more maybe we won't but the way that we got that organically was we have a great relationship with a lot of the reporters that cover these spaces because for the past three years I've built out an email list of anyone that has ever written or talked about politician stock trading and they are in a beehive I send them an email anytime something is interesting that comes out you know hey Pelosi made this trade here's all the information if you want to write a story about it go for it hey this politician did this here's all the information if you wanted to write a story go for it hey we sponsored the UFC it kind of went viral it was kind of dope here's all the information if you want to write a story go for it and that's I think like the importance part that people don't understand about uh being like if you really want to be a good growth marketer you got to have your hands everywhere and I recommend to people build out a email list of reporters that cover your space and don't sell your product don't sell you just give them high quality content make them feel like they're always in the no with their space because when they do want to write about it or if they do they turn to you because they see you as an authority and they start quoting you they start featuring you and that that's uh the last part that we're going to try um and make work with the UFC as well and how do you how do you scrape that list is that a manual thing that you go and just have to oh yeah yeah purely three years of it I mean Twitter's a big thing and also like the last we're spoiled by this but you know this is just from years of hard work it's once you have an account that is an authority you can DM people and people answer like we we've dm' with the we've dm'd with tulsy Gabbert um we invited Mark cubin to the UFC fight he was doing um he was doing Shark Tank we've we DM people all the time and a lot of the news reporters they follow the accounts we can send them a very quick DM hey Chris I'm behind this account we have an email list that we update people with interesting and suspicious trades if you'd be interested in kind of getting added to it just let me know and they all say yes why would they not uh but yeah there's no scraping there's nothing like that it's just pure pure grinding of anytime you see an interesting article find them on Twitter DM them get their email add them to the list and then just start sending emails out and the the best part about getting press especially TV press is that you know once you get for example a 2-minute CNBC clip it's not about the 500,000 people that are watching CNBC at the time it's actually about repurposing that clip putting it on social and when not a lot of of people talk about putting some paid behind that to even make it go further yep 100% yep yeah we were featured in ABC uh they came in they flew us out this is also another this just so much the the cool thing of what we've done with autopilot is um people are fascinated with us because it's just like I'm I put my face out there like I am behind the Pelosi tracker I'm not afraid to you know will I die tomorrow like all that conspiracy stuff but people uh respect it appreciate it then they realize like oh it's just like a 28-year-old guy that yeah I'm not rich I don't have millions of dollars I don't have access to these things I'm building this for the community and kind of people get interested with that I put myself out there and then ABC news they do a whole feature set they fly out they interview us we crush it they love us we love them we take that piece of content we put it on Twitter or on Tik Tok goes viral on Tik Tok we take it on Instagram put it on Instagram and then bar stool picks it up and it's like just const L getting content out that makes yourself an authority is uh important um for every angle of the the growth side 100% okay cool and uh so what's next yeah yeah so so the plan of what we're doing now is we have all this content we haven't kind of fil uh shared the video yet but we literally did send a fake Pelosi to the fight she was sitting there in the front row with Mike m there's all these pieces of content around her the New York Post already kind of took it up they they created an article about it I'm going to be sharing a lot more content on our social media accounts around the the cybertruck the UFC is about to put up a story of us that I think is going to be really interesting and then looking back if people are listening to this go check it out because um you'll see like the formula of what I've done going back to the surface area part and this may be helpful for uh because this is just scientifically how I think about all this stuff is quick ad break let me tell you about a business I invested in it's called boring marketing.com so a few years ago I met this group of people that were some of the best SEO experts in the world they were behind getting some of the biggest companies found on Google and the secret sauce is they've got a set of technology and AI that could help you outrank your competition so for my own businesses I wanted that I didn't want to have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I didn't want to depend on ads to drive customers to my businesses I wanted to rank high in Google that's why I like SEO and that's why I use boring marketing.com and that's why I invested in it they're so confident in their approach that they offer a 30-day Sprint with 100% money back guarantee who does that nowadays so check it out highly recommend boring marketing.com sponsoring the UFC gives you a 10% chance of virality one out of 10 sponsoring the UFC and sending a fake Pelosi gives you a 15% chance sponsoring the UFC sending a fake Pelosi having a fake cybertruck gives you a 20% chance and the more and more stuff that you can do to add to that chance of virality is the name of the game I think in like the growth team and the social engineers and um kind of people in mys space so we're going to have more stuff coming what's next though on the marketing side and on the growth side it's I mean it's two things one on the product kind of without getting into kind of boring everyone on autopilot the cool thing we're a marketplace now so we're going to have people actually be launching their portfolios and we're going to be building content around those people like a Kathy Wood for example she can launch a portfolio on autopilot she then can monetize it we grow it for her we're all happy our end users are happy but in the other marketing side it's to double down in this kind of Pelosi idea and this is a bet that I'm going to take the same way that the nek boys are famous for these skits these pranks liquid death has they're known for these kind of crazy commercials dual lingo has their owls there's a world where we create kind of consistency around this Pelosi 2024 invest like a politician why do we want to get her reelected so we can keep copying her stock trades that I think is going to be the theme of the autopilot marketing for the rest of the year uh and it's going to be building moments around that there's something going on at Rumble in Florida that we might go to there's another UFC event maybe we sponsor um and it's just taking learnings from those and doubling down in the consistency of it all in an effort to get just people to love the brand like I I think people underestimate how much loving a brand matters especially in this world because no one really has any Affinity to Brands much but people have Affinity to people like the Greg Eisenberg podcast I feel like you guys probably have a loyal devout following of kind of your top five or 10% on autopilot that's what we're working on that's what we're building on and that is what comes next I think uh the other smart thing that you did which a lot of people don't do is they create a meme page they create a set of meme pages and then they create a product that has very low LTV but you're you're in the complete opposite like your you know Robin Hood TDM Merit trade companies like that will spend hundreds of dollars sometimes thousands of dollars to acquire a customer um and you're doing it pretty cheaply and smartly so I think that's really smart um I want to I want to actually shift gears we didn't talk about this but I actually built a meme page in 2020 I think 2021 and it was in the plants space back during covid when everyone was like getting plans for their office and stuff like that and we built it just for fun um and I want to get your brain to see if you built this what would you do next so I'm going to share my screen and we're going to do this live using your framework uh your scor card basically that you've created let me screen your viral scorecard yes so this is kind of crazy so this just to go just to show you how easy it is sometimes to build a meme page this was built in in a couple months maybe one a couple yeah one or two months and we also built a Twitter page which is now defunct but it had 500,000 followers and the idea was we didn't create any content and for people are listening on audio uh you can go to YouTube and see the page it's uh I need plants I'll try to describe it as best as I can but it was basically people would send us pictures of their like good-looking plants um and people like plants they really you know they like being plant moms plant ads and I used your kind of idea around uh the usernames I need plant um the difference between yeah the difference between um what you built and what I built here was um I think you can make more money building uh building a stock trading app than you can in the plant space that being said people are making millions of dollars a year doing you know AI plant identifier apps so my question to you is you own you know I give you this page as a gift using your method ology what type of content are you posting how are you thinking about a product to create which type of events would you sponsor and where do you take it from here yeah yeah yeah I love it this one uh reminds me of um in a lot of my ideas will come from that this have you seen the page of the people that uh it's called like I love this stick or something like that they send in content of like cool sticks they find around on social media um I I don't know what the name is but official Stick review Yeah official Stick review 2.2 million have you seen this account no so it's brilliant brilliant what they do is they and I think there's psychologically a couple reasons behind this what I would do is so yeah if you watch a video it's it's just people sending in Stick reviews because it's funny people like them you know um there's a world where this becomes a plant one too where you know you got a lot of you on your original page actually let me go back the reason why this is important is on Instagram growth comes from reals so you need videos and you can make one video around kind of looking at the plant this and that but the reason why this stick page works so well is because you have the commentary of the person and it just people just like it it's authentic it's real it's fun so first step with the actual um yeah like look at this guy you know just brilliant it's smart um looking at the the Plant Page the first thing I would do is I would start trying to build out a strategy around this where I would go I would personally film myself and just create commentary on like me talking to a plant the same way I would talk to a puppy or the same way I would talk to a kid and' be like this is my plant blank you know I've been growing it for this long like look at how pretty this one leaf is it looks like a heart like this is how I'm going to treat it I'm going to do this this and this and I hope it doesn't die you know things like that and eventually if you kind of build out enough um uh pieces of content around that you create open for submission and then you have everyone in your community start sending in videos of themselves reviewing the plants and being like hey this is my plant I'm in kind of uh Augusta Maine I've been growing this thing and kind of this is for the community the same exact way that stick one works and I think it's important because one you get original content two you get content from people that uh are enthusiastic and like your community and kind of can relate to other people and three probably the most important part is if you've noticed on uh Instagram the most viral stuff is funny and that's I like even like look at this right here I don't even know what what is that one with 130,000 uh uh when one of your plans dies ex exactly when one of your plans dies funny it's funny someone's just crying but you have room for a new plan yeah yeah it's brilliant the most viral stuff on social media is funny and that's I think like like the stick thing 2.2 million views that's just people reviewing sticks why is that it's just funny um so creating the content strategy around your me especially Your Meme pages that is built just to be funny and kind of make people laugh is the last way that I would do it and then I would introduce the product that you were mentioning create an AI plugin take a photo of the plant AI identifier charge 10 bucks a month 50 bucks a year have it in the linkoln bio use it in some of the videos and then um start making money because meme Pages again like I the the hard part about the meme stuff is a lot of the or original ones they don't have a product around them because they bu an audience just purely around content and memes the meme Pages these days now can be translated into a product um similar to the Pelosi tracker that can make people a lot of money if they uh do it right and also like provide value like I I'm sure people will like this idea of um identifying plants but that stick one is good right it's like random so good and that's why you know the stuff that works is scroll stopping and that is scroll stopping you're like wait is this guy reviewing a a stick yeah exactly is this guy reviewing a stick and it it's hard to remember that like even with my content the we have 700,000 followers and the ups and downs of the vi of the algo is crazy and it's like you can get into this path of um or this this trap of just posting just purely funny meme 10 to 15 second pieces of content but the problem is again going back to my original point that may get you 500,000 views but like your informative legit one that you put in in time for Authority gets 50,000 views you still have to do both and even with the plant one um that is I think like the the key to monetizing your audience the best via products is you can't just go full meme you got to go Authority or else people will just scroll right by you and not take you seriously which is also by the way Greg like why a lot of these influencers these earlier ones don't make money that much either like I don't know if you've ever eight or nine million followers and they put a link in in a story and no one clicks it meanwhile the people with the 100,000 followers put a link in their story and they get 10,000 clicks I I think it's like the time you launch them is under a different era and uh people have manufactured their pages to work in those areas I agree I think that's a good point if you uh if you want if you were thinking of sponsoring an event I don't know just any sort of sponsorship you know and for this plant one how would you how would you think about it I have no idea what well so I don't know what type of events kind of even go on with it but um I don't even know if you would have to sponsor it to that degree because you're not kind of necessarily building an out what I would do is I would go to the actual events and do Street interview conversations using the app um I I think about it there's a lot of money to be made in these apps this a plant one uh but I I would uh I wouldn't necessarily like you could sponsor it yeah for sure but um it kind of use that like the the interesting thing about what we did with the UFC was the UFC sponsor was important people have kind of said to me like why do you need the UFC sponsor why couldn't you've gone viral with the Pelosi tracker and the because you need some sort of authority in the entire ecosystem of the content strategy so if we didn't sponsor the UFC we would have just been like oh you guys sent a fake Pelosi that's lowers the chances of virality uh if there was a plant exposi um I would sponsor it and then would go with a T-shirt and I would start using the apps I would be interviewing people I would be having fun creative content how many plants have you killed in your life you know things like that uh that's the approach that I would do and honestly you could probably do it across a lot of things bird watching apps um animal app like I don't know what other niches there are there's just so many uh that what I would do and I bet you could probably make a couple million pretty easily honestly so when it comes to sponsorship of events the best sponsorships are kind of the ones that you're like why are they sponsoring it like why is this you know trading app sponsoring this UFC fight so I'm here in Miami and it re it was recently the uh the gun show in Miami it's like one of the biggest gun shows uh in in America and it's like imagine I need plants sponsors the Miami gun show and it's like don't kill people or kill kill plants instead of people I don't know you know something like that and then you create content around that that could be really cool that's one idea yeah one and the second idea so funny yeah I wasn't thinking about it yeah well you you you gave me that idea when when you were like killing plants and I was like okay killing plants guns kill people plants don't kill people there's something here 100% And that's like such a that's a good uh that's a good thought with autopilot I wonder what we could do with um like the stuff that we have coming because I don't know how expensive it is to kind of do that and then the strategy that I would run with that as a plant company is I would run that get a banner take the photo of it then go to a big big underestimated piece I think of Twitter and Instagram is people have built livings off of being social media news people um there's this major guy he's a British dude he's got bright blue eyes handsome guy on Tik Tok I think that's why he crushes it he's a British dude and I don't know if you've seen him on Tik Tok all he does is just talk about the news he's like 24 and he got 11 million followers and he just talks about interesting stories um on Instagram or on Twitter there's people Colin rug there's the Mario uh Nar naral and they just they're looking for good content they're looking for creative stuff and if you can kind of even go then you you sponsor it uh the don't kill plant don't kill people kind of thing at the at the NRA event as a plant company you then take those and then we talk about what we we said earlier you plant it plant um you you feed that that piece of content to these news people and say like hey we did this thing we we think it's pretty funny if you're interested to cover it let me know and we can uh hop on a call and maybe you get the organic kind of posts on that nature and that's what um that's again what I think we didn't do that well because we are in Raa now and you run into a lot of legal issues with that but that's what I would that's a great idea with the plant thing and honestly that that whoever's running that stick page they should launch a um like a Pokemon go catch them all stick app you know totally like they have so many users it' just be funny charge 10 bucks a month and see what happens totally that's such a good idea yeah um you want to hear my other idea yeah this is the startup ideas podcast so we could uh we got so this has been my hot take this has been my this has nothing to do with autopilot this is in the the the beauty brand era industry because I think like um there's just so much money in that because there's so many influencers uh and I'd be curious to hear your take on this but I have I'm kind of bullish on it for two reasons the idea is guys ages you know seven 15 I only say 14 to 25 they watch um live streaming of people playing video games why because it's cool it's fun video game stuff they watch Logan Paul there isn't really a world where that has translated over to the female world and I think like what what girl kind of 17 15 have had to um end up with is uh get ready with me videos you know one minute get ready with me vlogging Alex Earl Emma Emma Chamberlain and now kind of if you've seen on Instagram there's Trends around like girls just kind of get get dressed with me let me share my fit with you I think the next thing is the same way that 15-year-old kid boys watch other boys play video games I think think there's going to be a world where girls should launch their own live stream shop online shopping channels where it's them just going on 10 to 15 seconds maybe a minute maybe two minutes and they're just filming themselves online shopping it's like all right I'm gonna wake up like what do I want to what do I want today I want a t-shirt let me go to my favorite Pages oh I think this one will look good I don't know about this one chat what do you think about like kind of this one and they build a whole shopping experience around you just online shopping I I I think that is a world where that can turn into the same monetization efforts as boys watching video games of other guys girls watching other girls online shop and I don't think anyone's tried that and I see it as like the next evolution of getting ready with the makeup putting your outfits on fit checks to then I'm this is like what I'm shopping for online shopping experience and I think girls would eat it up that's my that's my pitch to cont cont creators out there go film yourself online shopping and see what happens yeah I think I like this idea for so many reasons one is it's a behavior that's happening already so you're kind of just unbundling it and you're just putting on its own um its own platform I think the idea for this to work it's going to need a name that's just like super super uh catchy while you were I mean this name isn't isn't right for this idea but while you were talking I was just like oh my God does someone own get ready withth me.com because that that is such a good domain wow yeah someone someone owns it unfortunately but like someone go acquire that domain like that is the perfect domain maybe actually I was going to say it's not perfect because it's like but you know what it maybe it is perfect get um so or even just like grw grw oh man that's so good hold on let's see if that's taken I might just want to take that I see this is a billion because like you know like the whole um Neil Patel went on a podcast and I I know that uh Gary ve they've been talking about this idea of like online shopping like live shopping is going to come to America it crushes it in Asia but it hasn't translated to America and I don't know if online like live shopping in a third party me sitting there on my phone watching you sell me something will work as well as you just watching me shop you know cuz like if I know this through all the the girls that I know out in la la is run with this stuff they're all posting videos of themselves kind of fit checks on Instagram on Tik Tok every comment is literally where'd you get that shirt where'd you get those shoes where'd you get those pants like why don't the girls just film themselves shoping and be like this is literally where I got it you know it's like and like the cool thing about it is like it's such low hanging fruit that it it follows the um what's her name uh strawberry milk Bob like her her idea she sells the bikin she just hops out she's like H she just talks and like half of the videos there's no ending to it it's just nothing it's just funny like I can see a world where like girls a lot of people don't know a lot of people listening to this might not know her so just for folks who don't know she's got like a couple million followers at this point and she she's like just a girl that you know people want to hang out with she's funny and she's and she's got this bikini brand that she like if she does a 100 posts only one out of a 100 she actually like promotes and she crushes it crushes and she's now built out of reality TV because her sister is um coconut milk mob or something and then she had this boyfriend who they called him Brad and then Brad launched a golf like merch company and then she then launched a female golf merch company they're just Hustlers I I respect them hard but like I think your point on that is so they don't sell they just they just live and I I I I think girls love that about other girls with their content I think the next step of that though is like people would die to see her scrolling through her phone shopping for herself I think they would watch 30 minutes of that um so I I whether that becomes a full-on product I'm sure it could like I don't know why um uh twitch couldn't do it but I think twitch is just it's branded too much as a video game site someone should build the twitch for online shopping 100% 100% if you like this idea Post in the comments we'll be in there so I would love to see this become a reality people are actually taking ideas that we're putting out on here and they're like building it like almost every day I'm getting a DM being like I took this idea so uh someone might build this what what other ideas have there been I I I've listened to a couple like some of them are kind of easier ones for like oneoff apps and other ones are like like I think this one is like a venture scalable business the the online shopping for girls yeah so I'll share my screen for a sec so have you seen this AI Haggler no so I I uh I talked about this on a pod I was like wouldn't it be cool if AI can just haggle for you and this guy did it and um he he the use case he has is basically like there's a there's a world where you can just use a phone agent that gets you a better hotel price so says r r AI agent calls hotels and asks for a discount for your last minute stays if you never ask you never know and and he posted it on Twitter he tagged me in it he's like I took your idea and it got like four or [Music] 5,000 okay I'm gonna I'm gonna I got four or five thousand likes on Twitter I'm gonna just play this R AI agent calls a hotel in Columbia speaks Spanish gets a discount on the hotel rate from 410,000 peses to 350 [Music] you get the idea basically uh you know he's he's getting a a deal because he's booking direct and he's charging five bucks for every phone call I think so people are like taking these ideas and the best part about that guy is that he didn't know how to code at all he like learned to self code W so it's full on AI yeah it's crazy yeah that that's that's that's that's the partly I'm you know I love my job I love the the startup you know we're crushing it with auto or we're trying to crush it we we got a long way to go with autopilot but um we're in it for the Long Hong I I get envious a little bit of these people at Google these people at meta it's like you guys could be launching these oneoff things like constantly like what you should be and I think like an example like that especially now if like that guy can do it he can learn how to code it and like there's clearly product Market fit with it because like why not why not do it um more and more people should be launching stuff like that that's it's cool that uh he actually followed through with it though it sounds like do not pay if that and yeah it's similar it's funny we the uh so I don't know you you've been to our office in LA but for those that don't know it's uh we have a little startup kind of Hub all number one apps um all kind of like we're all growth hackers at heart but we all are Venture back startup guys and there's been now multiple apps that have come in three weeks prototyped built it out solely to work uh in I don't think I can share the exact ones because they don't want me to they don't want people to know but um they built apps that literally work for Tik Tok and Instagram algorithms where it translates perfectly to the the algorithm to work and then everyone comments what app is that they then get downloads multiple apps have made 60 70 100K uh months similar to uh what's his name uh the guy that built the Cal app like like people should be launching apps like that constantly and Cal is an app that you can scan your F food plugs into chat GPT tells you roughly how many calories are in each serving um there's a world where you can build that for everything and more people should because I I think that also provides value that's what's kind of cool about it it people will Pro AI changed the game because it's not just Flappy Bird video games it's like this thing can actually make your life easier so it's we're moving in that direction it's cool you're bringing people on and just jamming on ideas I wonder if anyone will run with the uh the shopen one they probably will they probably will keep us posted yeah do it like straight up Do It um don't don't like do it tomorrow do it now so Chris this has been obviously so fun it's a pleasure you're like a Fountain of Knowledge thank you so much for coming on where could people get to know more about you and an autopilot yeah so uh we're big on Twitter Twitter is kind of our main spot and then we are kind of also on Instagram my personal Twitter where uh I try and tweet more but I do I use my social battery so much on these other accounts that I don't have enough time and mental energy to tweet on my own uh my personal Twitter though is Chris J Joseph's uh on the autopilot account we're going to start putting more and more fun content out you'll see if you go there you'll see the I'm starting strategy G in um around like nearly Monday kind of every Monday I'm going to post like it's Monday go get that money kind of because we a money app and you guys could follow the Journey of seeing if that will work I don't know if it will that uh is called join autopilot and then the big accounts that we run the Pelosi tracker the Michael bur tracker those are if you search those it'll show up I'm G to try this new account I don't know if it'll work this stopped to spend um that was inspired also by the all-in podcast and people listen there Jason was like want to do it I'm like I'll try why not and then uh we're also going to launch the uh GPT portfolio again if you remember that one where a year ago we thought it'd be funny to give chachu BT 50 Grand build an algorithm and have it not even build an algorithm just have it tell us what stocks to buy um that account will be coming back maybe soon um open AI sent us to cease and assist so we have to close that one down uh but that one should be back soon too and that's all on Twitter beautiful all right my man it's been real catch you later dude cool appreciate it thank [Music] you e

Title: Do this to make more money from your startup
Published: 2024-09-27 19:01:15 UTC
Description:
Join me as I chat with copywriting expert Neville Medhora to audit my websites and reveal the frameworks he uses to increase traffic and boost conversions. Neville shares his proven strategies for creating engaging copy that drives sales. If you want actionable tips to optimize your website and grow your business, this episode is a must-watch!

Timestamps
00:00 Intro
02:52 Audit 1) Design Scientist
11:31 Audit 2) LCA
18:23 Copywriting Frameworks
26:58 Audit 3) Community Empire
41:35 The shift from Communities to Memberships

1)  The "Caveman Voice" technique:
• Read your copy like a disinterested caveman. If it doesn't grab attention, it needs work.
• "Dumb, dumb, dumb. I don't care." - That's how most people skim your content. Make it IMPOSSIBLE to ignore.

2) Everything must earn its pixels:
• Every element on your page should pull its weight. If removing it doesn't change anything, DELETE IT.
• "Don't just put crap there because you can or because it was too afraid to hit the delete button." - @nevmed

3) Show, don't tell:
• Instead of describing your service, showcase before & after results.
• Example:
a) Before: 30 clicks, 0 sales 😢
b) After: 3,500 clicks, $400K revenue 🎉
• Let the results speak for themselves!

4) Reduce "brain cycles":
• Simplify your message. The fewer mental computations needed to understand your offer, the better.
• Buzzwords compound complexity. Aim for clarity and directness.

5) Start with copy, not design:
• Write your sales pitch in a plain text editor FIRST.
• If you can't make a compelling argument without fancy design, your offer needs work.

6)  The power of social proof:
• For communities/memberships, highlight WHO is inside.
• "9-figure bootstrapped founder"
• "Co-founder of multi-billion $ company"
• Make people think: "I need to be in a room with THESE people!"

7) Create urgency, but make it REAL:
• Tie promotions to actual events:
a) Q4 planning
b) New Year's resolutions
c) Black Friday
• Fake urgency is transparent. Real urgency CONVERTS.

8) The evolution of online education:
• Courses → Communities → Memberships
• The key? Overload with value. It's not just about connection, it's about RESULTS.

9) Engagement beyond small talk:
• Don't rely on "What's your favorite color?" posts.
• Tie engagement to learning outcomes. Example: "Post your email copy, and I'll punch it up live."

10) The lifetime vs. recurring debate:
• Lifetime access = harder to maintain quality long-term
• Recurring = allows for constant updates & high-touch support
• Choose based on your service model and long-term vision.

everything needs to earn its pixels so if there's a pixel on a page you know meaning the the the base element of a page is a small little pixel like that everything needs to earn its way on there so if there like like if you took this off the page like locate your Brands exist everywhere your customers and future customers are having conversations on the internet if you were to take this part out do you think it would change the page at all yeah it change it for the better yeah okay so it does not earn its pixels in fact it's dragging the page down so thanks for being honest by the way um so so same with analyze we analyze your current state of the union yeah whatever it's just it's just kind of like uh fluffy text right it doesn't help people aren't going to be blown away by this they are blown away by this though right so there's something different here this is a plus this is maybe C minus at best so if you got rid of that why not just just get rid of it so everything must earn its pixels everything must pull its weight on the page don't just put crap there because you can or because it was already there and you're too afraid to hit the [Music] but ring ring ring who who am I calling right now uh it's it's Neville madora from copyrighting course well Neville I need some help I need some TLC Tender Love and copy on a couple of my companies dude I should be paying you after that kind of slogan making that's pretty good yeah well let's do it let's let's let's share some screens Let's uh tear some stuff down and ask you personal questions about these websites of yours during this during this pod we're gonna the goal is to well my goal is for you to help me but by watching this or listening to this you will learn how to write copy that cells and uh so it's a win-win yeah I guess what we're going to do is we're going to look at pages of yours and see if I can make them better and see what's good what sucks and maybe some different strategies we could put on them and the reason that this is helpful uh I don't know about you Greg but I get like what's called like familiarity blindness so if I look at my own sales Pages I've seen them literally like 10,000 times I can't see anything wrong with them I know them so well that I'm like clearly this explains the product perfect but then other people look at them and they're like wait you do office hours and I'm like that was like half the page and clearly I messed up somewhere so it's no problem when people ask they're just like we don't know what to do with this page I'm like yeah that happens with everyone I can't update my own pages but you could probably look at it instantly spot what's going on so I think that's what we're going to do today all right let's get into it so first one design scientists so tell me something before we look at this page I I want to show you my process so okay I'm looking at this page P looks cool looks like it's designed pretty well I guess it's got stuff I kind of don't care um the first thing I'm going to do is this I'm gonna make my screen really small so I'm gonna do command minus on my Mac and be like what am I supposed to click and I guess I could kind of see that I'm supposed to click one of these things and one of these things is that right that's right okay so I don't even know what those are yet I haven't even like really looked at it but right away what is it it's book a free call okay so the goal of your page I'm assuming is to get people to book a call yes so so this page exists solely to get them here if the website works well it generates calls and then on the call we show so okay what is design should I should I say what design scientist.com is no no no we're we're not even we're not even there yet your goal is to get them to fill this out click Wednesday 11th at 12:30 and then fill out their name right correct um have yall ever tried putting it just like right there instead like have you ever tried just putting it here instead is that something you've ever tried we H we haven't that could boost conversions right away like I said like I don't really care about the copy and stuff I care about the results that the page like you having awesome copy on your page is is not really the goal I view this as like a really fancy business card and how can we get them to call us so the less amount of steps that you have the better like like for example if you were to take all of the information off of this page I'm just going to highlight all of this and I'm going to delete it and this is the whole page now and all you had was book a free call I bet more people would click that button and so if you just had like you know this book a free call link up on the page right away I bet more people would actually click it and know about it so one simple trick before we even get into it is like you could put that right on the page just just a consideration totally with that what is design scientist so it's kind of funny because what design scientist.com does is it works with startups and companies to help them with visual assets that convert and that generates clicks cash and shares H so many people have hired designers uh and they're sitting in their Williamsburg apartment with you know thick glasses or glasses that look like mine um you're describing yourself here so many people have worked with me um and they end up getting design assets that don't really convert at all um and I think that nowadays you know I you know what is a design scientist my goal of a design scientist is what if a designer wasn't just an artist so it's you know onethird copywriter oneir third designer and onethird marketer and so we built a we built a team that does that for other companies and it's funny Neville because it's kind of like how you know how a doctor some of the some of the most unhealthy people in the world are doctors yeah it's like we put up this website so quickly for ourselves um because the team is busy you know doctoring for other companies so I need you to help me get what's in my brain on this page design scientist so here's one of I'm gonna pull up your X over here one of the things that I'm biggest about is it's like instead of telling people can we just show people because a lot of you're talking about IM visual assets that convert and here's the problem I don't particularly see any of these visual assets on the page like what are you talking are you talking about like stuff like this no I'm talking about like Brands websites mobile apps infographics okay so let's say I'm just going to pull anything right here so I'm going to say this is the the stuff you did and before it looked like I don't know this whatever you know horrible example but for speed's sake let's do that so what if I said before 30 clicks and one page visit zero sales sad face right and I'm just moving really fast here for then then it says after design scientist you get 3500 clicks 150 page visits and 10 sales 400k revenue H happy face shh don't tell anyone but I've got 30 plus startup ideas that could make you millions and I'm giving them away for free these aren't just random guesses they're validated Concepts from entrepreneurs who built hundred million plus businesses I've compiled them into one simple database compiled from hundreds of conversations I've had on my podcast but the main thing is most of these ideas don't need a single investor some cost nothing to start I'm pretty much handing you a cheat sheet the idea bank is your startup shortcut just click below to get access your next cash flowing business is waiting for you now we didn't write any really like groundbreaking content or anything over here but this is pretty obvious of what just happened right and so I think people can say oh I want a similar type of result Maybe maybe we can get something like that so I call this like showing not telling instead of saying that like we make visual assets it's like what if we just had before and after and be like these are the kinds of results if you just had like three different case studies of this on the page I think I would much better get an idea of what this is and to be honest I've followed you for a while and I've always looked at your stuff like late checkout design scientists I've never understood exactly what they do because it doesn't show me um I understand it's a design agency but so I get I get the overall like concept of what you do I don't know what you actually create so if you were to do something like this and just show me Creations right here and results I would probably understand it pretty quickly it's so interesting because in our calls remember we were talking about booking calls well in the calls what we have is the sales team the bis Dev team they're like they basically go through before and after like that's the pitch so what you're saying is maybe it's about taking what's in the sales calls in the decks and the images and the befores and afters and kind of extracting it from the the sales calls putting it on the website as like a main main feature yeah and and these types of things actually do a lot more than people expect like it's not just showcasing your work but it's actually showing who you work with so let's say we copy and paste this exact example and we copied again so we could say like uh Proctor and Gamble right let's just say they were the one that this was for well what that tells me is that you work with Fortune 100 companies right so someone else so like let's say dell approaches you and they're like well we don't know if they can work with a Fortune 100 company like us they see Proctor and Gamble on there they go cool they can so once again it's kind of like showing not telling so I think that these kinds of results actually go really really far and just showcasing your work really quick and people go I want that let's get on that calendar call whereas right now I browse your site and it's kind of like you need creativity that converts buzzwords how we can help companies grow and then you list out all the basic chat GPT stuff of like what is involved in a design company uh the Einstein and design okay whatever but the thing is I don't really actually know what you've delivered here so I bet on your sales call you have a presentation that shows that you deliver analytics that you do split tests that you've done like AI analysis or whatever and you show ex actual examples you probably already have all this content you're just not showing it over here totally this is really clicking for me we actually can I show you something another website real quick yeah so we just updated our late checkout. agency website which is our uh basically a higher-end if you go to late checkout. agency it's kind of our higher-end version of design scientist so this is what works with like Fortune 50 companies and we added this right here we added this last week and dude I'm gonna screenshot that for my Swip file it's so good you don't know how many calls and in and emails that we've gotten from like the biggest AI companies SAS companies that have seen this and be like oh my God they're working with well if they're working with the CPO of fortnite and you know and I'm the CPO of EA games I need to work with them what we did here is we literally deleted our like we had a crappy kind of like design scientist website before and we just like deleted it and just put this and this is converting like 20x more 30X more yeah exactly and then also just I'm just I'm just brainstorming over here on this one yeah but one thing like one I just love it like I said I actually took a screenshot to put it on my own site swipe file where I just collect all cool marketing what if you even put and I don't think you could actually do this just with like confidentiality blah blah blah but the next step would be you put result and then you said like you know 400,000 more users fortnite you know 75% more in purchase whatevers gramarly 70,000 new users a day yeah right whatever so so that kind of stuff even takes it a step further for with with results assuming you have awesome results like that and assuming that they let you say that which a lot of places will be a little bit squeamish about Neville are you saying I should put basically add a column and and put the results there is that what you're saying if you're allowed to and if the results kick ass okay so go to go back to late checkout. Agency for a second so see if you scroll down we put a couple of um but no one reads that I feel like no one no one's like and we build it for them and then read it read it I feel like your idea is way better just put it in the table yeah ain't nobody reading that no one no one got to nine figures of Revenue right just I'm just taking millions of downloads right just just the basics and and the thing is sometimes people get a little too wrapped up in like well you know technically uh we can't say exactly the numbers because it's confidential it's just like give me an millions of downloads can we say that just a generic statement I don't need to know exactly what you did for for Shopify that's maybe for like a sales call that's we're not putting that on the website so yeah just something like this uh so instead of this which honestly I didn't I didn't read I think most people didn't you could have just put it right here where all the gold is already and um that's all you need to do yeah that'd be sick so so this way this way people know what they are getting um if you were to do this for design scientist it would be a similar graph maybe but it would say something like created 400 social media assets right created three viral posts exactly three million views that's right total right stuff like that so then someone goes so then someone goes to design scientists and they're like oh they create visual assets for like social media uh exactly brand new website converts 9 billion per you know whatever so those are the types of things that you could put on there and instantly someone gets the idea I know what they do so we don't have to tell them we don't have to write long paragraphs of copy if you've got results like this I mean just show it there there's no reason in chatting a bunch yeah dude yes yeah I mean this this kicks ass so this is already doing really well and remember what I told you the top of the call if you were to take out all this crap on design uh design scientist and just put like a book now thing and maybe a couple before and afters you get more results that's literally what this is it's like one piece of content essentially and then like request a brainstorm yeah also by the way great way to put the I really damn okay you really nailed it on this page I'm GNA take another screenshot here real quick I wrote a post about this brainstorm I wrote a post about this button so that is sick if you if you go to Greg Eisenberg decom and grab my newsletter you'll get posts like this but um yeah actually it's on my CK my convert kit so if you go to Greg eberg I guess it's Greg eber. ck. Page is that what convertkit is now yeah Greg eber. ck. Page request to brainstorm is great I'm gonna steal that so Kudos on that one that's sick Yeah so basically we changed it from book now to uh request a a brainstorm because people come to us for ideas like uh a grammarly will come to us for like hey I want to I need ideas I want to I want Innovation I want to see where it's going to go buttons it's called buttons that's the uh oh damn you gota be a subscriber dude you're not a subscriber that's crazy um anyways there we go so we changed that and it it literally I think like two or 3x conversion rate just by request to brainstorm and that's a that's a so if I click that that's also just like a connect with us type thing why do you do why do you do this connect with us versus a calendar thing have you noticed any difference on that so with uh LCA we the model is we only work with like 12 clients a year so it's very much we don't it's not it's not like we want a ton of calls it's just about we want the most interesting companies in the world so um that's why we look at who applies and then we'll only work with maybe 0.1% of it yeah that kicks ass so this is for agencies yeah yeah so so this page is I I think it's like an okay page I would rate this like a B minus yeah um in my mind I also like looking at it in Mobile and just to see and I think it looks better in Mobile actually I think it just has like a lot of white space oh here's here's another concept that I that I always look at uh I call it like brain Cycles you know how a computer works you know megahertz and stuff like that it's how many cycles happen per second and I think how many cycles per second does my brain need to understand what's happening on this page the less the better right so right now I'm like design Revenue unique creative that conver converts so we're talking about you know you got like a buzzword here you got a buzzword over here and buzzwords stacked together compound so it's like buzzword buzzword squared buzzword cubed in terms of complexity so my brain is like okay I kind of understand what they're talking about roughly but I'm having to like compute like but what do they do and so there's a lot of brain Cycles going on which I find a failure um however if we had this over here or when you have this one right very few brain Cycles to figure this out like it's pretty obvious what's happening or if you saw this before and after zero sales now you got 100 thousands of Revenue understood like right that doesn't take a lot of brain Cycles so reducing brain Cycles is a big thing that I like to tell people when looking at a page I don't even have to read it most of the time we just look at it and be like this is confusing there's some I don't know random ass drawings over here that's fine our procedure and then like ass tons of white space over here for some reason which I don't know sometimes to me like my brain goes like is that a mistake like you know maybe the web designer in me is thinking that so yeah that this is generally how I go through a page the other concept I'd like to harp on is this is that everything needs to earn its pixels so if there's a pixel on a page you know meaning the the base element of a page is a small little pixel like that everything needs to earn its way on there so if there like like if you took this off the page like locate your Brands exist everywhere your customers and future customers are having conversations on the internet if you were to take this part out do you think it would change the page at all yeah it change it for the better yeah okay so it does not earn its pixels in fact it's dragging the page down so thanks for being honest by the way um so so same with analyze we analyze your current state of the union yeah whatever it's just it's just kind of like fluffy text right it doesn't help people aren't going to be blown away by this they are blown away by this though right so there's something different here this is A+ this is maybe C minus at best so if you got rid of that why not just just get rid of it so everything must earn its pixels everything must pull its weight on the page don't just put crap there because you can or because it was already there and you're too afraid to hit the delete button so another important concept yeah and then and then lastly I think this one's important uh on pages I do what's called the caveman voice and like do you remember those old Geico commercials with like the dumb caveman where people see like this dumb looking Caveman with long hair and and they're like oh he's an idiot and he responds back like I'm actually really smart well the thing is like imagine there's a dumb caveman and he's reading the page and he's just scrolling blury eyed it doesn't really give a and he's kind of like dumb dumb dumb I don't care for some reason there's a picture of Einstein yeah okay that's how I read pages like I don't pay attention I I read like the average person on the internet does and I think that's what really helps you uh understand what's good and what's not so when I saw this you visibly saw my eyes light up and go like oh and then I started hitting command Shift 4 to take a screenshot that's good me scrolling through like a dumb caveman going like H okay stupid whatever I don't care that's probably a bad thing right like you're really not grabbing anyone over there so couple couple of uh important Concepts over there to learn I want to my my yes very very cool my my reaction to that on the caveman voice thing is for and this is relevant for anyone who wants to start an agency as agency owners we all try to sound smart yeah right like because our job is to be smart to help other companies that's the service that we're providing what you're saying is kind of you know write like you speak and just talk very simply um and I believe I believe you like I believe that that'll work what if you just said something like this I'm I'm totally making stuff up over here right but if you had something that said here's three examples that THX Revenue in three months that's that's something grabbing right take some of your like high-end let's see if this okay well that doesn't look great but you get you kind of get the point over here if you just put that over there instead of like our hypothesis you know that could just grab a lot more interest and get people it's like screenshotted people want to save it and be like oh my God that's so awesome like they did this like this is how it looked and now it looks like this and that had such a big impact that's what we want as well so I think stuff like that is like pretty simple to do especially if you're an agency that already has a lot of good results so I'll I've I've done work for agencies all the time this is very common that they're like it's a little embarrassing that we're a marketing agency but we're reaching out to someone to tell us what to do for marketing and I was like it's familiarity blinds it's totally okay and I asked them all these cool what can you share about your results and they have crazy ass results and I'm like wouldn't it be helpful to just put that on the page over here and they're like oh yeah I never thought about it so yes very simple to do because i' I've seen your page a million times I had no idea what you did to know um should we look at a A Different Page yeah the other aha moment before before we click that is your page can literally just be one image basically so uh yeah start your website by like one image and then just kind of like layer on as you need fit as you you know as it earns its pixels as you say so that was a big aha moment for me I will often before uh I come up with business ideas in my head all the time uh I think yeah you see like right here on my page there's like a folder that says ideas and I come up with stuff all the time and what happens is I find it really helpful to actually write the sales page or homepage first and this is a thing I learned from like base camps Jason free he always talked about this back in the day he's like write the copy out and like a text editor no Rich formatting no bold no text sizes no nothing just write out the copy you want and then build off of that and I've always taken that to heart because it really gets at the it gets the heart of like what you are trying to promote what you're trying to sell and how you're describing the product and what the value proposition is if you start designing the page which is always tempting you're going in framer you're going in whatever WordPress it's tempting to like make it look pretty but we're not trying to make pages that look pretty that's not our goal our goal is to get a page that converts and so I do think it's really really helpful when you're starting a business idea try to write at the sales pitch and you'll quickly realize oh this is a bad pitch this this isn't good and so I I I have discouraged myself from doing a lot of businesses that'll take me a lot of time with no result by writing out the pitch first and then I'm like yeah this sucks I've I've so many people told me to make a a copywriting agency I start writing out the page and I start quickly realizing like the problems of like why it wouldn't work too well so very helpful to do quick ad break let me tell you about a business I invested in it's called boring marketing.com so a few years ago I met this group of people that were some of the best SEO experts in the world they were behind getting some of the biggest companies found on Google and the secret sauce is they've got a set of technology and AI that could help you out rank your competition so for my own businesses I wanted that I didn't want to have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I didn't want to depend on ads to drive customers to my businesses I wanted to rank high in Google that's why I like SEO and that's why I use boring marketing.com and that's why I invested in it they're so confident in their approach that they offer a 30-day Sprint with 100% money back guarantee who does that nowadays so check it out highly recommend boring marketing.com all right Community Empire let's do it this is this is like I'm so embarrassed with with this copy but so once again I'm going to I'm G to make this really small and just like look at it visually the page looks nice it's super small I could tell that I'm probably supposed to click this I guess or this okay so at least kind of know what to do um I think there's like a call to action here and a cool picture I don't know what it is yet looks pretty simple already I'm kind of liking this page I I don't I don't hate it so if I can let's say for creators on build your internet Empire product generate okay um I think my biggest issue is I don't know like is this a CO is this a course is this a cohort do it start at a certain time I think that's just my main questions already um I love this picture though I think it's kind of cool feature business building more than a community ship it's a membership okay is this an ongoing m ship that I could like go to like school.com and click like SLG Greg or something yeah so the idea here was um yeah I think it's it's called Community Empire so let's see if that pulls up but the idea here was solo preneurship is pretty lonely and I think there's also a lot of people like Indie hackers people who want to build businesses without taking Venture Capital but a lot of people don't have the accountability they don't have the knowhow they want to build internet audiences they want to build communities um they need swipe files for a lot of this stuff um so and then selfishly I wanted a group of people who um I could hang out with connect with invest in hire like we've hired PE hired people from this group we've uh we've been you know been in talks recently actually I'm buying someone's company from this space so it keeps me at like the Nexus of this people so um it's it's a membership for people who want to accelerate building a business without VC money or and are you talking about building a business specifically like as a community like on school or is it like does this have to do with Community it doesn't um so my whole thing the way the way I build businesses is using something called the ACP framework um yeah so ACP talks about that yeah yeah it's basically a it's basically like a funnel so you start um you start with the audience so you build like you know you start off by building a Google doc of some copy I start off by registering a Twitter account and just start tweeting so I start by building an audience and then from there I convert that into a private Community to try to learn uh a little bit more get the power users and then from there I build a product and service to service that community so everything I build and I'm betting my whole I've been been been Bing my whole career on this has been using the ACP funnel so no to answer your question you don't have to build a community to like on school but I do believe that having a community helps accelerate the ACP funnel that's pretty cool I I do like that so I guess you don't drive people directly to the school page you get them to like apply before they can get in yeah and that's just so you can vet people before they come in and kind of stink up the place that's why we recently changed it is because um we want to we want to keep it a really high quality group so the weight list helps do that so okay so a commun I I run a community one thing that you might want to do have you talked about the people who are in there right so for example let's say I go to uh a Hustle con event right so there's going to be like the founders of Wei workor and the founders of whatever big company or some crap like that up on stage I'm probably not going to get to meet them but I'm gonna be able to mingle with other people in the crowd so that's a big part of why I'm going to go there who else is in this community of note like does anyone you don't have to name names or anything but is there anyone of note or do they have like a cool business going any anyone you have in there yeah I don't know if I want to like put them on blast but I will say that there's several people who've who either have eight figur nine figure businesses or built them in the past yeah let's not name names however let's talk generally so remember one we'll just talk about generally n figure yeah go ahead uh yeah nine figure boot trap business member two would be um co-founder in multi-billion dollar VC backed business but now he's interested in cash flow so that's why he joined what about this you definitely heard it let's say it's like Casper or something like that right like we don't have to put them on blast but we could talk in vague terms remember three etc etc etc right so I'm just gonna copy a couple of these now if you were to put like three five six 10 of these like this is this is kind of like you know what Sam's doing with Hampton or something like that it's like the the the purpose is like who else you are going to meet inside the community it's not just access to you so so you can say I want you to be part of this crew and awesome convos going on inside I also wonder if you could talk about specific conversations inside um I assume yall talk through the school platform it's like a chat thing Forum Facebook post kind of stuff is that is that how it works we do um but we also have weekly workshops um within so we'll do like Zoom type stuff can you give me an example and once again you you could OB skute names or whatever of something that's happened inside of a weekly Workshop that's kind of cool sorry to put you on blast right away and think um so I mean first of all we've had guests who I think are super interesting like um Andrew Wilkinson uh co-founder of tiny which is a another really big holding company MH um and then he'll come and he'll talk about let's say holding companies we'll have um here let me pull up yeah don't worry I'm I'm just going to make names we we'll we'll keep going I'm gonna say Tim Ferris and Mark Cuban for fun whatever okay so inside what are some like conversations that have had like are they talking with you sometimes it's like an office hours where they ask you questions and you answer sometimes it'll be with me sometimes it'll be with my team but it'll be um very tactical so it' be like how to get from Zer to 100,000 followers with uh you know seanp I'm just making an example um but they're all they're all like that um so we'll take an expert and it'll all be really uh around the tactics to get from point A to point B like give the secret sauce and then we also run something called Sprints mhm which is um you know in the next 30 days we're going to go collectively get to 100,000 followers so everyone signs up to a Sprint and we provide um like a lot of the curriculum the trainings the guest speakers the accountability to help get get you there and then everyone kind of shares um what they're learning so to okay so that's that's pretty cool what makes it even more real is you give like an actual example so Mark got 20,000 followers with a super viral post you got 15,000 followers collectively we hit 115,000 new followers in one month right like some sort of result is often kind of cool yes um also and this is really hard I actually I have a problem with this I actually made a module inside of copyrighting course where we just talk about recent office hour sessions because I people have asked me this in the past like what do you do in office hours I'm like I forget and every week we have dope questions um so so here's all the ones we did from like the last office hours and it goes on and on this is all just from August right and it goes on and on and on and on and so um it would be helpful to put a couple of those like really cool conversations preferably that have resulted in an action because if you just a lot of people will put testimonials and stuff like Greg is awesome cool who gives a um it's like Greg is awesome he helped take my company from Z to10 billion in one day much better right there's like a result in there so I think having some sort of like results from these convos and listing out maybe three of them like like Billy was doing X but after talking to Greg he did y now they get 100,000 plus customers right some sort of result coming from these conversations uh the other thing could be Jason got hired by Greg now he's head of marketing whatever so these kinds of results are what are really cool to see and once again show don't tell like you could just be like here's here's what's going on here's some of the results you don't have to like you know be vague about it cool but I I do like the look of this page I I actually think it's like well done I would like to see more about who's in there um if you're allowed to say some of the people yeah I think that's really really helpful like I know these are guest guest e experts and stuff but they're not in the thing um so saying who's in there would be really really cool um yeah that's a good page so it looks like you already got like a decent amount of members in there right yeah I mean it's it's it's one of those no-brainer offers like I'm I'm buying School school cost $99 a month so this costs $149 a month so for $49 a month you're getting access to uh you know these peer groups workshops all the content pretty much everything and I don't even think it's on the page but there's also a million dollars of software discounts that you get with the membership um which is pretty insane so um I don't know how long we're going to do this for in in the sense that um I don't know how long I'll continue buying school memberships for people and I don't know how long we can continue giving this much value at this price but it it is for now I yeah is there like some sort of urgency that you could put on these and urgency is always best when it's tied to something real if you just say like sale ends in three days and it's just you know August 27th or whatever it's not as real as if it ends like at the end of the quarter or at the on New Year or on Christmas or on Black Friday cybermonday Etc so it might be interesting and to what I do actually what I found works well is if we're going to do a promotion tying it to Q3 and Q4 is always really good Q3 is great because it's often like the doldrums for a lot of people in sales summer is kind of slow for a lot of companies not all and what happens is you have time to like redo all of your promotions that happen in Q4 and just remember in Q4 you've got Halloween you got Thanksgiving you got Columbus you got holidays you got um Cyber Monday Black Friday Christmas New Year's and these are all great times for people to buy they're in the buying mood but also more importantly like I tell Q4 is always big for us because people want to say like all right 2025 I'm gonna get my business into shape I'm gonna redo all our autoresponders I'm gonna redo our emails I'm gonna update our Pages I'm gonna get Neville's help with it um and so Q4 is always big because we can tie urgency to something that's real meaning like 2025 is about to start you need to get your together if you didn't do it this year so it could be interesting to have some sort of urgency where you get people in all at one time um so that could be something like next enrollment or it could be a sale or it could be just like a Q4 promotion where there's no sale but just saying like hey this is a great time to get in so next year you can start off right I like that I also I wonder what you think of this I mean the reality is I I I don't know exactly how many members we have like 330 or something but the reality is once we get to let's say 450 500 we're just we'll either cap it or um the price will just be significantly higher um we actually started off at $99 a month but we just had to increase it so we can like publicize basically those numbers and be like these are if if you think this is a good idea you know at 400 people it's going to be uh $200 a month at 450 it's going to be 250 at500 it's going to be 350 what do you think about that I think it's okay I think it's a little bit slightly dense con concept and the thing is it's not backed up by anything if you were to say since like do you have like employees that work inside of this or anything yes yes okay if you tie it to that be like to manage to give the level of uh service to each customer at 100 people I had to hire it couldn't just be me I had to hire someone at 200 people I had to hire another person at 400 people another person right if it's tied to something real I think that's good I think the whole like 400 price increase it's I think it's okay I don't think it's like Earth shattering a lot of people would be like yeah okay whatever you're at 340 you're not even at 400 yet but I I do think like saying that you're G to cap it at a certain level so you can have a certain level of service I think that's kind of cool cool yeah I like that for example sorry if if you're going to do like next enrollment starts for Q4 and then say like once we get to 500 we stop accepting I think that's powerful like those two concepts are good you know yeah cool I like it let me ask you a question you do a lot of communities like this right is it or or is it just the only community that you're part of no tons okay I mean have you noticed that like it used to be like maybe 10 years ago or or maybe even more courses were popular because you couldn't get all this information online now you've got YouTube you got X you got all these places that just AI that just give all that information essentially for free right so I have noticed and tell me if you notice this too course creators are all moving to communities now right yeah uh course creators are moving to communities and communities are actually moving to memberships and to me there's a difference between community and a membership interesting a membership yeah my a membership to me is I'm paying for access to be you know ident identify as Xyz and I'm paying for access to this XYZ membership and what I get out of that could be a community could be software could be deals could be content could be XY you know XYZ whereas a community is just you're paying for access to other people and I just think that a lot of people are burnt out of you know paying for another paid Community just so they can hang out with other people that's my that's that's like lame I feel like you could do that in a lot of places for free now there's all sorts of free discords there Reddit there's all sorts of uh different Facebook groups and stuff like that also U one thing one thing I've noticed for is I've noticed that people have moved out of like the Facebook group model that was really popular a few years ago and people got a little flamed out on it and I think the reason is they were going based on engagement so they'd be like what's your favorite color what's your favorite software tool and that works well for like a few like days or months but then people get tired of like these like random engagement posting type things and so I think that's the reason that a lot of memberships have had had struggles I think one of the key things that we did with our community is the way that engagement happens is that we have courses okay and courses still are the fundamental part of it training courses like you could watch me talk about how I make emails whatever and then after the end you can either post your email on that post and I'll help punch it up as well as a ERS or you can just ask a question and I'll respond right there and that's how we keep membership like engagement alive rather than like just asking questions every week because questions get old really fast yeah and so a lot of a lot of uh communities are like oh here's a place where you can talk about copyrighting and you're like okay like I I just don't understand what like how what's everyone's favorite software it's like the same questions over and over and over and then it's just like engagement Peters out eventually and people get tired of it yeah well yeah 100% uh that's why I'm such a believer in the membership model just like you're overloading with value and it's not it's not just the community piece like people think that Community Empire for example like oh it's another place on school like how many how how often am I actually going to go and get value from it but guess what our retention rate is for for Community Empire it's insane guess how many people it's it's 80 it's 84% 84% are active which is crazy which we probably should put on the website yeah 84% active are logging in all the time because there's so much value like what other you know the only other place for that is like Instagram and Tik Tok where you're seeing 84% that active what are some other what are three other cool ass facts about about uh the the membership I mean probably like Collective you know cash flow of let's just say $100 million a year or $200 million a year or probably more probably a billion at this point like that's that's huge just try to figure out one way to like write it in one sentence there we go yeah I mean that's that that's kind of cool to see over here I don't think you need it right here but the point is like somewhere on the page there could be some like little things like Collective cash flow of a billion dollars you're like oh so there's like big time people in here right so that's helpful to know yeah I like that yeah this is I mean this is pretty cool overall I think it's a pretty good page it could have a little something extra to it what what is your thought I'm just asking you Greg like what what do you think of showing people what's going on inside of the community like giving a little preview or something like that what's your thought process on that um I think uh I think we should do it I don't know why we wouldn't do it because like there's you know I'm just opening it up right now there's so much interesting stuff like it sells itself it's it's kind of like what we talked about before with design scientist um the post cell itself so why wouldn't we here yeah I think so too I feel like most communities like don't share that stuff I think e-commerce fuel um is one like the only one I've seen that actually shares like some like what's behind the scenes cuz I've been in these membership groups before that I've bought and I remember like they they they don't show me what the hell's inside I'm just like like what are you even like running this on I think most people don't care is what I found like just through surveys like they don't so long as they get what's promised on the page like they don't care the delivery method whereas I actually care like what platform is it on and stuff I don't want it to be like some harded platform um I did a little thing where I put on my sales page a Community Feed like a live Community Feed and I'm not sure if it helps or not but I think it's helpful and we used to have a lot more but it's just on mobile it was just massive so it actually shows like a live feed and if if someone actually posts right now it'll like show up on here so it's just embedded in the page how do you feel about confidentiality in that case well the thing is I think it goes away quick so if you check in like an hour this will all be different it's just gone um so it doesn't really index on Google or anything and then the other thing is it's just the headlines it's not showing what they're talking about and so I have ever got any complaints or like concerns about it because it's it's on there for a brief amount of time then it goes away so we're not showing everyone everything uh it's just a little bit and even um even get oh man I can't show you my full screen but um I'm gonna pull this up real quick uh on the side on the sidebar whenever I whenever someone's a guest they see this they they see like a live feed a live updated feed and when they click that it shows them an error it's like oh you got to be a member and I can't prove it with numbers but I think it gives people fomo and they want to join because because they want to see like like someone's here's my autoresponder what do you think and then there's like 14 replies to it and they're like ah like I would love to like learn from that right I I actually just noticed one of the one of the people on that feed is a community Empire member um so that's also interesting which is which is uh you might see a friend in there and you're be like oh I didn't realize that you know Amit is in there I'm definitely going to join so you know who does we actually we have a directory but we don't publish it um I just don't want to put everyone's name on there because I think part of it is confidentiality but I think small bets uh does a cool job at this where they put all the members and and by the way this is lifetime membership that they're selling so it's a little bit different so they have a large number of members but they have a directory and you can see everyone who's joined and when and I personally find this very compelling I don't I don't think I would ever put this on my own Community but I do find it compelling that you can see who joined and like check out their ex so I could just like who's George and like look at his ex and be like oh he does this and I've like kind of snooped on this before and I thought that was kind of a cool thing I like I said I don't think I would do it would you put something like this up for free for everyone to see I wouldn't do it publicly uh we have a private directory and people use it a lot because all of a sudden like if you see Neville in there it's an excuse for it's like oh Neville is a community Empire member I'm gonna go message him and so I feel like there's that trust if you if you made it public it just you lose a little bit of that trust so um I wouldn't do it publicly but for I get it for small bats I get it for small bats because it's so big it just depends on the nature of your thing because that's like a cheaper product lifetime access the goal is to have like access to a lot of people which by the way when you think about the lifetime access thing what's your thoughts on it I know my thoughts I mean we wouldn't start a community like for example Community Empire we have like one of the top Community managers in the business running it and people love him um his name is Patrick and um if small bets is doing a community like I I do they have a Community Feed I think they do right um I don't know if they do I don't I don't I have not seen a feed I think I think they have a chat and it goes into campfire which I believe is part of Discord or something yeah I mean I think that there's there's room for this which is Lifetime but no Community I think the mistake uh people make is they open up a feed and then all of a sudden someone might Poison the Well or too much promotion or you you know there's so many ways that a community could go wrong um but I think it you know small bets is a huge I mean I'm not on the product but I think from what I hear people love it um and it's so cheap right um so I think it's like 180 bucks or something yeah so it's just like it's a different offer I I so how do I feel about lifetime I see I think that there's opportunity to do it just don't open up a community yeah I I used to do lifetime like when I sold courses and the problem is like things happen so let's say I'm talking about emails and like now convert kit is out compared to when I first made the videos and there's a whole different software I use and now you know with AI things are very different I'd have to re-record videos and trainings and update things all the time for someone who paid me $300 s years ago and that's just not like the greatest business model in the world to me and so and then also inside of our community we actually rewrite people's copy and so if I had a person who paid $300 seven years ago I have like professional writers in there that I have to pay I have a staff I have like development costs to maintain a community like this and so it's just it's just not possible to give people really really good service and if we had all like I don't know like what 15,000 people or something that have been through in the the previous years that would be in a tremendous amount of like people requiring copy like how do I update this entire autoresponder there'd be no way we could service that um so we have to charge a membership and some people don't like that but I think people are pretty used to it now but I think membership like a recurring membership is the way to go and some people will use it for only a few months some people will use it forever and I think that's the way we've moved a long time ago and I've seen a lot more course creators do that by the way you want to know know my here's my thoughts on how course creators go you start with one course right you build an audience so let's say like you in the early days you build an X audience and you have 20,000 followers and everyone's craving for someone something for you to sell you make a course it does really well so you go hey that was kind of cool so then you make another course and then you make another course now you got three courses and now people are confused as to what you do it's like you got community Empire Compu Community this and community that and they're like which one do I buy so then eventually you say I'm going to bundle them together for one big price so that's the next step and then what happens is people say like well can I just get that one or this is too expensive so then you say I'm going to bundle it together for $97 a month and that's where everyone ends up landing on like the membership model like here's all my crap you get access to it for like a monthly price or one big price per year so I have seen that's where everything goes and I have seen course every course like add some sort of membership with varying levels of success it's very difficult to keep a membership going and keeping people engaged for a long period of time so anyways kind of a random rant Neville this is this is why I called you this is this is exactly why I called you this is this is exactly what I needed and I'm happy we went through these two examples because on the design scientist side it's it's really for anyone who wants to build an agency so you basically live cooked how to create copy for an agency and then for the community Empire example ex Le you live cooked how do you how do you write copy that sells for an info product a digital product the membership business so thank you thanks man thanks for having me on it's an honor appreciate it where could people get to know you better you get a copyrighting course.com um it'll well I'm logged in right now but it'll show you a little newsletter sign up that's probably the number one best place I'm also on X at SL neved first three letters of my first name and last name neved so I'm over there I also got a YouTube channel called YouTube copyrighting the old spelling with K's so that's kind of fun and I interview a lot of people over there I've done a lot of previous trainings but recently I've been doing more long form interviews and then um also on Instagram this this goes surprisingly well we do all these like short form reels and stuff like that so every day I post one real and uh that's a pretty fun way for people to follow as well so copyrighting course.com or Neville madora and all the socials dude I didn't know you're I didn't know you're so busy like those that's a lot of uh you're creating content I guess so I mean it's I guess I guess I got a system down to where it doesn't seem like that crazy but yeah when you look at it and you're just like we're on Tik Tok Instagram Facebook LinkedIn that it's yeah I have an agency that splits all the stuff up into shorts and then posts it um but yes pulling stuff getting the long form stuff is the hardest part so totally I record a lot of long form with the intention of cutting it up into short form also just doing like this it's kind of like I selfishly want to ask people cool questions um and get their ideas on it and since there's a camera in their face I feel like they answer better and uh and then they get some promotion I get what I want out of it the audience hopefully gets to come and play along too so it's pretty fun 100% all right my man I'll catch you later thanks man appreciate it have a good one everyone bye later [Music] down baby

1) Why Vertical SaaS?
• Market often overlooked by VCs chasing unicorns
• Opportunity to build enduring businesses with strong retention
• Still massive potential in 2024, even in "boring" industries

2) How to pick your vertical:
• Focus on industry, not idea
• Look for:
a) Large market size ($1B+)
b) Fragmented (many SMBs)
c) Mix of small, mid-market, enterprise

3) Understand the industry inside-out:
• Map end-to-end operations
• Get hands on P&Ls
• Follow the money - where are they spending?
• Identify areas still using pen & paper

4) Analyze existing solutions:
• Look for legacy providers
• Identify where they're using horizontal solutions
• Find gaps where AI/FinTech could add value

5) The power of the wedge product:
• Your "get in the door" offering
• Should be:
a) Easy to implement
b) Solves a critical problem
c) Ideally free or low-cost
• Example: Roofer․com's proposal tool

6) Go-to-market strategy is CRITICAL:
• Many industries require relationship-based sales
• Product-led growth is ideal (but rare)
• Get creative: Industry newsletters, memes, etc.

7) The payments opportunity:
• Owning the transaction can 10x your market size
• Build before/after transaction, then capture it
• Example: Toast in restaurants

8) Pricing framework:
• Understand current spend on problem you're solving
• Price based on ROI you deliver
• Aim for 20-50% of value created

9) Keys to success:
• Only build products that:
• Increase revenue
• Decrease costs
• Prevent churn
• Maintain compliance

10) Validating ideas:
• Don't just Google search
• Talk to actual businesses
• Offer to buy lunch and shadow operations

vertical sass you've probably heard the name and you're probably like yeah I wish I can create a vertical sass that prints millions of dollars well I brought on the number one guy who talks about vertical SAS he's got the vertical SAS Bible and uh he spills all his secrets on the step-by-step way to create a vertical SAS this is a guy Luke sfinos who's got a vertical sass business that prints Millions himself uh he's a vertical SAS advisor to Atomic which builds billion dollar businesses like him and hers and uh this might not be the most exciting podcast I've ever done might actually be a little bit boring and that's the point uh vertical SAS is boring but uh that's why there's so much opportunity and we do use AI to come up with some some fun ideas so watch the watch the whole thing and and take some notes enjoy [Music] all right I got my man Luke to come on and teach us about vertical SAS vertical software and I know it sounds boring but if you stick to the end of this you're you're going to come out with a lot of knowledge he's gonna he's GNA teach us the vertical SAS Bible and and uh I'm excited to dig right into it awesome Greg thanks for having me man looking forward to it so where do we start you know do we want to start with why vertical SAS yeah let's do that let's start with why vertical SAS so I think you know my thesis on this is is relatively simple and straightforward and you know vertical SAS isn't something that's new um you know if you look back all the way to when first PE people really started creating software use cases were all tied to businesses it was tied to how can we better optimize better you know create more efficiency right create cost Savings Time Savings Revenue lift blah blah blah but I think somewhere in the last kind of 10 15 years a lot of that got lost and we got into the sexy you know VC let's chase massive billion multi-billion dollar opportunities and go unicorn hunting and so what happened is you had a bunch of Founders that moved away from industry specific software well why because they're they're Market constrain you're only going after one market and you know for a VC there's just not a lot of of of individual industries that can create these these extraordinary outcomes that they need to see and so all these Founders started chasing really broad kind of startup Concepts and obviously you had huge winners in that but you had a lot more uh you know grave sites so I'm I've looked really I've spent the last decade building you know a vertical SAS business in trade schools which is probably one of the most like boring Industries you can you can contemplate but there's so much opportunity for still today in 2024 to not go build the shiny sexy thing with Limitless you know Market size and hone in and focus on one industry you know one type of business uh and build software tailored for them uh and build really great businesses that are enduring strong retention you know they don't necessarily have the growth rate that the VC guys want to see in in most cases but uh you can build great businesses in these these settings so I'm I'm obviously bullish on it I've dedicated my career to it and that's what I do cool yeah and and it's working like you're making millions of dollars a year in revenue and through the process I think and that's why I wanted to bring you on is you've kind of figured out a playbook for the different types of vertical SAS businesses had to think about wedges which is like a wedge product which is something I really would love for you to get into um how to think about picking a market for your vertical SAS and maybe i' I'd also just love you to go through pricing like how do you think about pricing your vertical SAS so where do you want to start yeah so let's I let's start on um how to dive in and actually start one of these things and so I think it's much more of a I think vertical SAS is much more of a science than an art I think people believe starting a software business is this artistic thing where you gotta come up with some crazy big idea and you know you got to hold it close to the vest and you can't tell anybody about it and you got to raise millions and millions of dollars I think it's a very like mathematical scientific approach in vertical software and so I'd love to just walk everybody kind of through how I how I think about that as a place to start and that'll lead well into wedge products and we can give examples of wedge products and you know how to actually get in the door at some of these businesses how does that sound that sounds perfect let's rip it let's rip it I like it jam session baby all right I'm gonna um I'm gonna share my screen I'll talk through this for those that are listening but I've got a bunch of stuff kind of outlined in my my quote unquote Bible here so let me let me pull this up all right so so the first thing that you're going to see here is uh you're and again back to science so I'm a big believer in picking a industry and not a and not an idea so you don't come up with an idea at all that's not the first step that's not even the 10th step so you have to focus on an industry um and there's certain characteristics that make an industry a really good opportunity for vertical SAS right so I have this check list we'll go through all the checklists but the first thing I like honing in on is like all right how do I know what industries are out there well there's a bunch of great resources I've mapped out over a thousand Industries um and I map them out on a couple key things the first one is how how big they are right so what do the companies in those end Industries actually do from a revenue standpoint so you can see the biggest industry in the US right now is is General Medical and Surgical Hospitals they're doing nearly a trillion in revenue and there's 200 companies so the first thing I like to look at is revenue but the second thing that's that's very important is how many companies are in that industry and why this is important well you can see in in Surgical Hospitals there's only 2500 companies in that space so that means it's incredibly enterpris driven right selling into the Enterprise is incredibly difficult you have to have a ton of of of product in massive features sets to actually get something in there so I hate topheavy Industries especially if you're a bootstrapper and you're not trying to raise you know tens of tens of millions or hundreds of millions of dollars so the segmentation in how the industry is actually broken down is is hyper hyper critical so the best markets to look for are you know bigger bigger the better right especially if you're doing a venture kind of opportunity if you're doing bootstrap it doesn't need to be that big but um a solid amount of operation ating revenue and then the better the segmentation uh so what do I mean by that well there's a healthy mix of small businesses right businesses that do a couple million dollars a year in Revenue there's a healthy distribution of mid-market businesses you know maybe those are companies doing 10 to you know 50 to hundred million doar a year in revenue and then business Enterprise so over a hundred million do why that's important is because as a software company it's so much easier to get into MBS they require less you can get in with a smaller feature set or maybe even one feature and then you can add to the capability kind of grow up a little bit you know uh take the punches and and develop kind of broader feature sets that can then go serve a mid-market and then an Enterprise so the first two things I have to look for when I'm I'm thinking about this is again not an idea we haven't even talked about an idea yet right it's how big is it and what's the particular segmentation shh don't tell anyone but I've got 30 plus startup ideas that could make you millions and I'm giving them away for free these aren't just random guesses they're validated Concepts from entrepreneurs who built hundred million plus businesses I've compiled them into one simple database compiled from hundreds of conversations I've had on my podcast but the main thing is most of these ideas don't need a single investor some cost nothing to start I'm pretty much handing you a cheat sheet the idea bank is your startup shortcut just click below to get access your next cash flowing business is waiting for you questions there does that make sense yeah go back to that for a second when you when you scroll on this list what is one or two industries that you're like whoa this there's something here and I need to dig in and why yeah so I've broken these down um actually into like individual scorecards so there's a couple that I really like here so the first one that I love that I think is dying for a vertical SAS business is machine shops so um why is machine shops interesting well going back to that list it's 26 2 billion or 240 billion in Revenue there's 22,000 of them and it's beautifully segmented right so the higher this number is the better um out of this is basically a score so I'm taking all thousand Industries and you know this is up at the top 70 763 so if I actually look at machine shops it checks a ton of my boxes because it's highly fragmented there's a healthy amount of small businesses to go after midm markets to go after after in a few Enterprise and the average machine shop is doing 2 million a year in Revenue right there's 17,000 of them uh so this looks like a perfect place uh to build a vertical SAS company right now it's got a beautiful Market size beautiful segmentation and then I have a couple on the list here that kind of things I look at after that initial piece that we'll go into and what do you say to people who are like wow he's right there is an opportunity in machine shops but I live in Tribeca and I've never even visited a machine shop in my entire life I don't know anything about it is there still an opportunity for people yeah so look I didn't know anything about trade schools um I went to traditional education like I had family that went through the trade school route but I you know I lived in California I was like a tech guy right I started it bit my business in college and you know obviously if you have the domain expertise and you spent a bunch of time in machine shops right you're going to be uh a step ahead of someone who hasn't but and there's a correlation with successful outcomes and actually actually having the industry expertise but it's not a requisite at all so you know we've built one of the biggest vertical SAS businesses in the country for trade schools and it's I didn't know anything about trade schools until I started a decade ago so there's hope there's hope for you listen okay cool I mean look I think it takes again it's back to more of this is science versus art right so you have to go and you have to learn everything about machine shops as you possibly can um and there's opportunity in boring right and I don't look at vertical software as boring because I like I think it's incredible problem set it's it's you know it's a puzzle that you got to put together and the way that I try to learn about machine shops and this I'm sharing now on my screen um something from toast S1 so toast is a publicly traded vertical SAS business a lot of people know about it they do restaurant software right and what they did in their S1 is they actually visualized a restaurant in every aspect of its operations end to end and so this is a very important part in determining if there's an opportunity in machine shops beyond the few characteristics that I talked about right so you have to map out the entire customer journey and the entire operations uh of the businesses within the industry that you're you're going to serve so in toast S1 they literally have visualization of every aspect of the restaurant the back office the kitchen the bank the delivery piece right uh the actual restaurant itself the bar um you know people at home that are trying to find out about the restaurants with websites and marketing and so you have to really understand machine shops even if you're in Tribeca um and I did this at corsky too so here's my example for trade schools like we have we understand all right the first piece of a trade school is admissions right it's finding students to enroll them the second piece is actually training them well how does that look it's not actually a classroom setting like they're training them in a garage right and they're training them with a a real car uh for an automotive example and then you have all these other bits and pieces I don't have to go into all of them the IT team this know student services the compliance and Regulatory piece the placement group is actually responsible for getting folks in there and as you actually visualize the end to end operations of the businesses within the industry this is how you start to actually identify is there where is the software opportunity and how big is that software opportunity i' I've never thought about it like this and it makes so much it's so much sense because I always think about it from the software perspective so there was a famous blog post called the unb unbundling of Craigslist a guy named Andrew Parker wrote it where he visualized Craigslist and all the different pieces of it and how each part was getting unbundled into you know I guess vertical software so for example you know there were dating you know people use Craigslist for dating then dating apps came out people use Craigslist for uh short-term rentals Airbnb came out and there's you know better versions of it and I've actually written a post called the unbundling of Reddit which is kind of the same idea different subreddits different you know vertical software but this is kind of taking it and flipping on its head it's saying these are industries that have a huge physical component to it visualize it and then thinking about okay where does software play a role in making this way more efficient yeah no totally and I you know it doesn't necessarily need to have a huge physical component to it but you have to map out and visualize the endend operations of any industry that you're intrigued about you want to go after I mean that's the nature of of vertical software so it's there's a you know I have over a thousand Industries in here right pharmacies uh restaurants Banks chiropractors gas stations you know uh IT services right home Home Centers Home Health Care is a really interesting one furniture stores is a really interesting one churches um the there's so many Industries I have a thousand the Better Business Bureau has over 5,000 um and so it's the science of and we're we haven't even scratched the surface yet we're just getting started which I love but it's how big is it what's the segmentation and then let's actually map out and understand kind of the End Business operations um and what that looks like from A to Z all right let's keep going hit that scorecard so there's a couple other things that I like to do um beyond that piece I'll I'll jump back to the the scorecard here so the the first piece is um outside of now that I've mapped out that particular uh you know end to end operation something that's really important to do is get your hands on as many pnls as possible so you want to look at as many pnls as you can from as many businesses in set industry as possible so an easy place to start is looking at like publicly traded companies within that space and looking at their pnls um another hack that I love is I talk to as many Bankers within that industry as possible um Bankers are an incredible Source uh because they buy and sell companies all day and they typically are industry focused and so you when you get your hands on a bunch of pnls you actually start to understand where are these companies spending money um and so like one of my core beliefs in software is you have to build software that either increases Revenue decrease costs or uh prevents customer turn and then depending on the industry a fourth one would be maintains compliance so some Industries highly regulated that becomes like a need to have and not a nice to have some you know Industries don't care about it but every single business in every single industry the CEO is trying to to and the owner is trying to increase Revenue decrease costs prevent as much customer you know churn as possible and so I want to understand when I look at those pnls like where is the money going um how much of it is being spent on people that could be automated with software right and in what specific functions how much of it is being spent on software all right what software are they spending money on and how much are they spending on it and what is it actually delivering or doing for them um it's one thing what what they're saying it's doing it's another what it's actually doing right um but a p&l will tell you a lot and you can start to really understand where existing expenses are going and how to create solutions that um that support you know the challenging pieces on that p&l makes sense follow the money that's the that's the follow the money step yep yep absolutely so outside of the following the money the other thing I like to do is I I like to spend a lot of time looking at um the competition and what when I say competition we don't even know yet what we're building right we've talked about a few steps here but we still don't even know what we're building we're not supposed to even be idea focused right it's science not art so the next thing I like to do is say okay what are what are the existing software Solutions looking like in this market there's typically a couple things that happen when you go deep dive on one industry there's either massive like Legacy providers that are trying to do and and and probably are doing pretty much everything A to Z right so if I go back to like the trade school example there's probably like an Erp that's 30 years old that's doing all of this right um so that that will come up in some examples another thing when you're kind of studying the software competition you'll see is you know is they're they're kind of pulling together a bunch of horizontal software Solutions right so non-industry specific software so they're pulling together you know a CRM that's built for any type of business they're pulling together a um uh you know a source of Truth or source of record or Erp that's built for any type of business um they're stitching together you know slack and and Gmail or Zoho or or something uh and that's I like those opportunities because it's super fragmented and and they're dying for an all-in-one you typically see one or the other uh when you dig into these industries the third thing you see and I promise you and people fight me on this but I promise you you see paper processes still and I it's 2024 I know you're going to be like Luke you're you're out of your mind I don't believe you um we still see at trade schools a bunch of paper processes in some of these indust areas but when you look at competition it's important not to just search like trade school software right like you have to look after you map out how these businesses operate a toz you have to look at each of these buckets and understand like what are they actually doing in each of these key areas right um and that's where you start to see interesting things coming because you'll say oh my gosh they're doing all their academics portion on paper right or they're doing all their placement stuff with horizontal Solutions um and this is right for a vertical component or all their compliance is like outsourced right to some Consulting shop um this is how you actually identify and uncover opportunities it's not Google searching like restaurant software does that make sense it does I'm just wondering if I'm let's just say I'm building in the trade school space and I want to map out and I want to figure out who the competition is is you know is there a way that Ai and could kind of do some of that heavy lifting have you tried that yet quick ad break let me tell you about a business I invested in it's called boring marketing.com so a few years ago I met this group of people that were some of the best SEO experts in the world they were behind getting some of the biggest companies found on Google and the secret sauce is they've got a set of technology and AI I that could help you outrank your competition so for my own businesses I wanted that I didn't want to have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I didn't want to depend on ads to drive customers to my businesses I wanted to rank high in Google that's why I like SEO and that's why I use boring marketing.com and that's why I invested in it they're so confident in their approach that they offer a 30-day Sprint with 100% money back guarantee who does that nowadays so check it out highly recommend boring marketing.com yeah you know I I like um I like AI for uh the search component you know like we'll use we'll use chat GPT to just try to do a lot of the desk research piece of it but my view of AI today is that a lot of this information we're talking about it's more like research reports and analyst reports and so AI would be great for like the revenue size of the market the segmentation of the market right more of these higher level pieces that a research company would put out I think AI isn't going to do a great job yet on like what is every single step of the workflow for a you know a bank Let's uh let's try it out just for fun let's try it let's try it let's see what it looks like okay I'm gonna I'm gonna share my screen real quick okay so what what do you think I should prompt Cloe uh maybe in your space um what do you think I should ask let's do um let's why don't we try the Machine Shop example since let's do it we're gon shops yeah so first question I'd ask it is like tell me about the market size and the you know in the United States for machine shops um for machine shops in the USA and I'll give you like 15 questions to ask it we'll see how it does so that this this is perfect right this is the for this is what we had 40 billion annually 25,000 machine shops employees 300,000 people growing one to three% uh industry is largely fragmented I actually this is amazing I love it uh with many small mediumsized businesses how are there also a few larger players that are con with uh some consolidation trends no real geographic distribution okay so that's beautiful so that's a perfect place to start right so next thing I would go into is um let's pull up the scorecard uh walk me through uh you know what a machine Shop's operation looks like end to end walk me through what a machine shop operation would look like n to n oh man I love it this is so great Chang the world crazy I actually didn't expect it to be this good to be to be frank it's it's good so what what we're seeing if you're listening to is they have basically steps one through 14 with one being if you scroll up what was one again it was uh requesting the quote Yeah so customer inquiry and quote order processing design and programming material prep setup Machining quality control inspection documentation package and shipping uh invoice and followup maintenance and cleanup so this is beautiful so the next thing I would ask it is like tell me uh what software Solutions are you know prevalent in the Machine Shop industry and can you tie those back to you know the end to- end process wow do we need to include do we need to qualify at this point like do they need to be doing a million in revenue or is that just complicating it it or what do you think um yeah maybe you just say like uh well you're saying what software Solutions are prevalent right so is that you think be more clear yeah let's let's let it rip because you know you could do you can also say like in this list and you know how many of these how how many of these softwares are like 20 or 15 years or older I love that yeah I love that so this is great so it's telling us they use crms erps uh design like CAD software right design software um manufacturing software machine monitoring software quality assurance and management shopware Inventory management project management scheduling and it's giving us a couple in each of these yeah so why don't you ask you that like how many of these are less than five years old I'm going to say list all the softwares here that are isn't it older than five years or older than 10 years because that's isn't aren't those the ones that you want to disrupt yeah so there's there's two areas one is is Legacy pieces right um yeah the other the other angle is going to be areas where uh that are still on paper that haven't actually been digitized yet yeah that's number two and then number three is where where they're where are they stringing together Point solutions for right so those things you're probably not going to get out of AI um we should try why not I mean we're not let's just try it let's just say let's just use it like a real person so we're gonna say I'm trying to come up with a vertical sass with my friend Luke um and we actually for machine jobs my friend Luke and we we have a framework so the first is um what did you say Legacy yeah so first is what areas of machine shops are still being run on pen and paper what areas of machine shops are still being run on pen and paper I'm going to say basically that says there is an opportunity for software okay second I so the other thing I like to look at is a like AI opportunity and payments opportunity so which which areas are um which areas are machine shops not leveraging AI so I always look at AI opportunity fintech opportunity I just wrot something on the payments piece that's so important um third I'd say is uh please identify uh areas where machine shops are are using a myriad of horizontal Solutions horizontal software Solutions this is an excellent approach identifying opportunities for vertical size whoa you know it's you know it's getting real when they do this this like this over here on the right where SS writing I love this so much so um for for people listening so on the right hand side there's an analysis machine shop software opportunities analysis area still using pen and paper literally just listed out job tracking and scheduling many smaller shop deals whiteboards and paper schedules tooling and inventory often tracked manual and log books machine maintenance log frequently kept in binder notebooks it's literally telling you where there's opportunity here for pen and paper what do you think of the pen and paper section reactions I think it's absolutely incredible and so my next step here would be to go and validate all of this right just show up at machine shops say I'll buy everybody I'll buy you guys lunch today I know I probably look like a crazy person but I'll buy you guys lunch today if you just let me shadow the operation for today go validate it that does that work like people will do that yeah you'd be shocked yeah yeah cool especially in like blue collar industries like you just say hey I'm trying to build a software company for machine shops and you know I just want to make sure that uh you know I'm building the right thing you know can I buy you guys lunch just to let me kind of watch and see what happens perfect cool so pen and paper number two areas not leveraging AI predictive maintenance AI could anticipate machine failures before they occur optimize job scheduling AI could consider multiple factors to create efficient schedules automated quality control AI powered computer vision could enhance inspection process energy manag management AI could optimize machine uses to reduce energy consumption you get the idea here uh Luke what's your uh reaction to the areas not leveraging AI section I think um I think there's I would doubt that any of any aspect of machine shops today are probably utilizing AI especially in SMB and midm Market I would highly doubt it which is great so this is showing a ton of opportunities I bet you there's even more yeah and I and by the way there's probably an opportunity to just like design this using like vzer and you know just design a prototype or a framer website even and just show this to a machine shop owner and be like hey if I built this would this be of interest like getting their feedback cool and then section three areas using multiple horizontal solution project management often Cobin get together General purpose apps tools like Trello Asana spreadsheets CRM many use generic crms not tailored to machine shops accounting and invoicing General accounting software often lacks machine shop specific features etc etc Luke reaction I it's on the money it's on the money I think the so this is incredible so AI is is a incredibly helpful kind of assistant for anybody listening to go build a vertical SAS I think start out with those Frameworks around Market size segmentation right and then this can be a totally it's it's your own research assistant right I the only thing I'd say is do not there's no news in the building right so um make sure you go out and spend time validating and ensuring that what we're seeing online is is the reality in person 100% 100% I'm GNA ask it one last question question which I don't think it's going to I don't think it's going to work but I'm I'm getting greedy I'm going to say these are all really great ideas I honestly can't believe it my issue is I don't know if these are validated ideas I was thinking of going to machine shops to get their feedback um IRL but I hope you can save me a trip validate these ideas for me let's just see what happens I don't have High Hopes but I was nice okay so it's giving me some some idea does on how I can actually validate the ideas look it even wrote you a a machine shop SAS validation plan it's pretty cool this is insane it's so crazy yeah cool all right um I think the next thing that I I would do so so let's zoom out for a second right so we've found an interesting Market it meets like the size requirements it meets the segmentation requirements we've studied the endend operation we've um we basically have a couple different areas where we understand you know there's product opportunity software product opportunity um the next piece that I think is hypercritical is you have to really understand the go to market and be comfortable with to go to market before you go and invest a bunch of time here and so let me give you an example of that is I see Founders all the time they build these beautiful products they come up with Incredible things well the you can have the a great product but a great product without users is a shitty product right you know that better than anybody Greg um and so you have to be understanding of the distribution piece and so a way that I like to do that is I like to look at vertical SAS companies that have scaled in that particular space space and I study their go to market and I bet Claude or chat GPT would help here too which is like tell me you know one of the companies that came up there was Fishbowl right I believe it's inventory management for machine shops um but tell me about how you know they got their first 10 customers firsts 100 customers firsts thousand customers I think one of the things that Founders need to be cautious of in vertical SAS is a is go toar market is really really difficult in a lot of these industries and what I mean by that is um a lot of them to date have required pretty heavy outside sales models so they're not your typical like product Le motion where I can you know drop a product uh on product hun or via email and and get users like a lot of these are kind of country Clubby you know sit down shake hands build relationships typ types of businesses and so if you don't want to do that go to market needs to be a very key piece of your scorecard and it needs to be a key piece of your scorecard especially if you're looking at doing a venture take over the world type of startup because VCS almost always like to invest in companies that have product Le or marketing Le customer acquisition because it's just faster right if you look at sales Le publicly traded companies all of their average contract values are massive like the only way to build build a really big company at least based on historical data like prove me wrong but the only way to build a really big company if you have a sales L motion is if you have like pretty substantial acvs uh and ACV being average contract value right so like um if you want to grow fast you want to lean you want to find Industries where you can acquire customers via product Le or marketing Le approaches how important is building media being on social like are are are the Machine Shop people of the world on on social like what's your what's your take you know look I don't know about machine shops um I think that's one of the key things on a scorecard to dig into and figure out I mean people listening to your your podcast like smart people right creative people ambitious people they're going to do it differently than everybody has done it before so it doesn't mean to do it how everybody's done it before it means to understand how they've done it before and so you can see what works and what hasn't worked doesn't mean you can you can add in your own flare and and make a few bets that you think can can uh result in Faster growth or you know better economics or whatever and so yeah I mean newsletter creating a machine shop newsletter like I'm sure those guys are on their email right yeah uh I bet you a lot of those companies aren't doing that well so it's all industry dependent and I bet you like if you ask me if you put me in a corner and you're like Greg how do I get the 1 million people who work in machine shops and onto like a newsletter what I would do is I would do like a daily funny Machine Shop Meme email where you just are like it's like inside jokes like you hire you hire someone who works in a machine shop in like De Moine Iowa and you're like hey like the dad joke of the day yeah pretty much yeah and then you have all these people Advocates and it's like oh by the way I'm like I sell this software and then you know you you start building up multiple pieces of software and before you know it you know the lifeblood of your of your uh software is this newsletter yeah so that that's why Greg makes the big bucks here because he comes up with the creative approaches I love I mean I love it I'm gonna do that for trade schools you should you honestly should uh Nob brainer Okay so go you know what else have you know where where we at on the scorecard so we've talked go to market was the the next one I think um kind of and I'm we're jumping around a little bit but I think that's okay so going back real quick to the product piece I think we we talked about opportunities and product I think it's probably good Greg talk a little bit about wedge products yes um so everybody has a different name for them I call them wedge products what a wedge product is is I Define it as it's your get in the door product so in vertical SAS if you found a good opportunity like the end all Beall is to be the One-Stop shop like the all-in-one solution the source of record the thing that they use for everything A to Z right but nobody starts there nobody ever starts there and so if you have if you're like I'm going to build the One-Stop shop for machine shops investors are going to look at you and be like well you're out of your mind because it's going to take 10 years and you know hundreds of millions of dollars and and you're going to go and you know they do so many things you're going to go an inch deep and you're not going to do any of them well right so the typical approach and like the approach I use at my business was you find an area where there's it's on paper there's like really shitty competition but it's really important to the customer right and it's being done very poorly today and you're able to come up with something creative that gets is something that is easy to get in the door with they can implement it and deploy it quickly like it's not a 12-month implementation um and it's your reputation prover like nine out of 10 folks fail on their wedge product and it's because in my view it's because they don't like really think about it so let me give you an example of like a beautiful case study on Wedge products I write about these in in you know my vertical SAS newsletter but a beautiful case study on this is a company called roofer dcom rr.com they're building roofing uh they're software for roofing companies well roofing companies are the this beautifully massive Market huge mix of smbs midmarket Enterprise really bought like longtail lot of small businesses so beautiful thing it would have checked all of our boxes we came up with great what rofer did is they didn't say hey we're going to build allinone software for Roofing and they went to Market with that they said we're going to build a proposal tool right that enables um proposals are really important like you go on Google and you you want to get a proposal like well what was happening is you you call some number and some like random guy shows up at your house and is like hey I'm here to like give you the proposal on your roof and it's all awkward and he's got his clipboard and he tells you okay it's going to be $1,000 after he like climbs up on your roof um so what these guys did is they created a proposal tool that literally just used Google Maps to like look at the roof and it wasn't perfect right and but it enabled the roofing company to on the back end say hey um here's my pricing like here's what it should be this is what it should look like and then customer was able to get a real-time quote they could they could you know obviously with a star that says like subject to change when I when we get out there physically but should be in the realm they're able to book book it well when they book it roof.com got paid so it was a free wedge product right so they were able to they were like the first company I've ever heard of that acquired roofing companies via marketing like they did Instagram ads and Facebook ads and blah blah blah and they were able to acquire them um via digital which is like unheard of in Home Services Industries like it's always heavy sales Le like inside sales calling calling calling they got in with that product it spread like wildfire among roofing companies because it's like this free tool yeah I don't care if you you know take a percent of the booking because it's going to be on top of what I'm getting so no money out of my pocket you create this cool digital experience for the customer like I don't have to send somebody out until they pay me awesome so then they go and they launch a CRM right and so now they're moving down the entire lify life cycle of roofing companies I bet you next they're going to build like the Erp right like they'll they'll they'll get to the all-in-one they didn't start with the all-in-one but they built this wedge product that enabled them to it was a reputation prover it was easy to implement right and it was easy to get in the door it was a marketing ledge customer acquisition or marketing Le customer acquisition approach so you know what's easier Greg than acquiring uh um a net new customer acquiring an existing customer right so it's so much easier for me to sell something to somebody that already uses my product than it is for me to sell someone who's never used anything so they're like yeah those guys had a great proposal tool like let me look at their CRM maybe we we want to move off of ours and now I'm willing to pay like a SAS based kind of monthly fee for that CRM as opposed to this transaction kind of business model on the wedge product that was like a beautiful and I'm you know if you ever have the founders on I'm sure I got some of that wrong that's like what I've heard through the ether but that's like the perfect wedge into software uh you know CRM and I'm sure the next step for them is like Allin one I like it for a few reasons one it's follow the money because it's like a proposal you get it out there and then you close the business and then all of a sudden rofer is the hero um because they you know they helped close that business which then in you know number two increases the trust around the customer and and the business so I think if you're trying to create it sounds like if you're trying to create a wedge product think about how you could like what is the wedge product that could create the most amount of trust absolutely the other thing I'd add to it too that's really important in vertical SAS is if you can build a wedge product um before or after the transaction you can eventually own the transaction and so let's talk about that for a second like adding payments into vert your vertical s your vertical SAS solution is the way to like build massive massive companies in in vertical software and so every single Big Industry specific software company owns the transaction all right so let's unpack that a little bit let's say toast remember we've talked about Toast restaurant software right if they go out and they say hey investors we're going to build an all-in-one software for restaurants there's um I'm using rough numbers it's like gen generally accurate I think but there's like a million restaurants in the us and we're going to charge you know 10 bucks a month uh and so now you do the math on that what's a million times 10 bucks not a lot it's 10 million all right uh so our our software Market size is 120 million right so like VC is going to look at that and be like that's not big enough at all if you're bootstrapping absolutely big enough right but now what happened with toast is they said wait we're gonna actually Implement payments and we're going to take a piece of every single transaction that flows through those restaurants well the those million restaurants do one trillion in revenue and so now our Market size went from 120 million to like you know whatever a couple percentage points one you know 1% 2% depending on their take rate probably a little lower than that of a trillion dollars right like very very big difference so it's it's one it's all these vsas companies can scale insanely quickly by adding payments and so if you can build a wedge product before or after the transaction and hopefully before and after the transaction you eventually can capture the transaction and I see like we implemented payments at corsky before they were using PayPal like trade schools were literally processing payments through PayPal so okay I already have all the students they use my app every single day they use it to clock in and clock out of class they use it to track their skills like it's obviously they would way rather the student pay through our solution where we already have all the accounts made we know their schedules you know we know everything about them versus I got to go create an account in PayPal and now I got to like export all the transaction records into like my Excel sheet and figure out who's late on their payment and who's you know who's not and how does that look on like a school by school or program by program and now like it's it's it's a it's an FID nightmare so vertical specific payments is like a beautiful beautiful opportunity and it's typically not a wedge it can be but if you can map into that you can build a really big business I like it we're running out of time but I I have to ask one one more piece to the scorecard uh because I know people are in the comment section are going to be like you got to ask this pricing how do you think of do you have a framework for thinking about how you price these things yeah so you know pricing I think is like the least thought about thing in software and which is crazy it should probably like be one of the most thought about things in software um my Approach is pretty pretty basic but I think it works so my Approach is I understand how much does the thing cost that I'm solving right and once I figure out how much the thing costs I shouldn't say cost how much are they paying for the thing that I'm solving today right um and then I can look at actually coming up with some sort of pricing model so let I'll give you a concrete example so we came up with a retention tool um we kept hearing from all of our end customers that like student retention was a problem like all their they had a bunch of students that were dropping out of you know their their Trucking you know school um and so we said okay we're going to build a tool that like analyzes all of their academic data and their attendance and and basically floats up a risk score that tells you which students are at risk in real time and then we're going to automatically text those students um who are like trending in the wrong direction and and try to motivate them via text you know with resources and ways to get back on track right so then we said okay well how much is a is tuition for a school well it's $20,000 all right if we assume well what's the school's retention rate well right now it's like 70% okay so what we found out was like they were losing millions of millions of dollars every year on this problem and so if if we able to build a solution that like saved five students right who were halfway through the program and they were each paying $20,000 to go this program like that was serious and so now I'm able to price my product way high because I say I can you know look we're forecasting that we're going to save you x amount of students that translates to Y and so this is what we're going to do for you and then this is how much our product costs over time I was able to like look at all the customers that use this and say hey our average lift is 3% based on your business and the inputs you gave me that equals to X dollar of Roi therefore I'm charging you less than the ROI like half of it which is this so I try to look at things like from first principles in that sense which is break down the money how much money am I making you and then could you give me a portion of that money basically is what you're saying so that it's anywhere what is it anywhere between 20 to 50% yeah I I probably try to start at 50% and then I like listen to the market feedback and I adjust either up or down based on that there you go I also only I only build products that increase Revenue decrease costs uh prevent customer turn or or uh or help with compliance like because those are the things that I can have clear Roi on if I'm not doing that like I'm not I'm not gonna be able to sell it it's not what people care sure Luke uh this has been a master class I'm about to like hack on a couple vertical SAS ideas this weekend or markets and ideas this weekend I appreciate you coming on where could people get to know you your writings learn more about vertical SAS yeah absolutely so I have a newsletter it's uh it's just luk aos.com um It's s o p i n oos is how you spelled my last name it's called the linear newsletter it's on substack I I basically it's a free newsletter we we uh we it's all about vertical SAS it's all I talk about it's all I write about um so you can go subscribe there and then I just dropped the vertical s Bible which is vertical SAS bible.com that's a paid resource um only reason it's a paid resource is because it's literally like the last 10 years of my writing distilled into a thousand pages and I have a thousand Industries in there and um it's it's a bunch of good like case studies and how-tos and Frameworks on how to go build one of these things so tot that's where you can find me and then on Twitter Twitter Luke sfinos and you don't want a 100,000 people you know competing in in vertical SAS like we're keeping it small this is uh you know we we're keeping it a little small I appreciate it thanks for coming on um and uh I'll see you around see you around Miami awesome Greg thanks for having me man appreciate you later [Music]

Description:
In this video, we dive deep into the clearest path to achieving a $10 million liquid net worth. I outline my step-by-step blueprint that has proven successful for entrepreneurs and solopreneurs alike.

00:00 Intro
01:24 Step 1) Pick a NICHE niche
03:59 Step 2) Hit 250k impressions/month
06:33 Step 3) Convert 0.5% to leads (1,250 organic leads/month)
08:36 Step 4) Monetize leads immediately
09:50 Step 5) Reinvest profits into buying more leads
10:15 Step 6) Your lead generation machine
12:28 Step 7) Nurture your community like CRAZY 
13:07 Step 8) Ask the community what to build
14:21 Step 9) Launch a $30/month offer
15:09 Step 10) Convert 3% of total leads
15:09 Step 11) Year 1 Review: 672 customers, $201,600 ARR
17:45 Step 12) Reinvest ALL profits into buying leads
18:18 Step 13) Year 3 Review: 5,000 customers, $1.5M ARR 
18:24 Step 14) Introduce a Premium Upsell
18:57 Step 15) Year 5 Review: $9.11M ARR, 50% annual growth 
19:20 Step 16) Exit options: Sell for 3-5x ARR ($27M - $45M) or keep your cash cow

1) Pick a NICHE niche
• Don't go broad. Use tools like Reddit, Google Trends, and Glimpse to find pain points in specific niches.
• Example: "AI for solopreneurs" not "AI tips for Businesses"
• The riches are in the niches

2) Hit 250k impressions/month
• One viral hit can do it, but consistency wins. Post daily, engage, be THE person in your space.
• Pro tip: Craft a compelling bio + cover photo that makes people want to root for you.

3) Convert 0.5% to leads (1,250 organic leads/month)
• Create IRRESISTIBLE lead magnets. So good they'd be dumb not to grab it.
• Tools like Gamma.app for beautiful, gated content.
• Examples: calculators, ebooks, exclusive videos.

4) Monetize leads immediately
• Use affiliate links in your lead magnets. Aim for $1+ per lead.
• This isn't just extra cash - it's fuel for growth.

5) Reinvest profits into buying more leads
• Use that $1,250 to buy 625 additional leads at $2 each.
• Now you're at 1,875 total leads/month. The machine is running!

6) Nurture like CRAZY
• Weekly newsletter or community (WhatsApp, Slack, Facebook group).
• Give so much value they feel guilty not paying you.

7) Ask the community what to build
• Prioritize their pain points.
• Pick one that's:
—  High value
— Relatively easy to solve

8) Launch a $30/month offer
• Aim for $300+ per customer annually.
• Make it feel like a no-brainer "tip" for all the free value you've given.

9) Convert 3% of total leads
• That's 56 new customers/month.
• If you've done steps 1-7 right, this is surprisingly easy.

10) Year 1: 672 customers, $201,600 ARR
• Feels small? Don't give up - compounding is about to kick in!

11) Reinvest ALL profits into lead buying
• Your funnel is now a vending machine. Pour in more fuel!

12) Year 3: 5,000 customers, $1.5M ARR
• Introduce higher-ticket upsells:
— 20% at $100/month
— 5% at $500/month
• New ARR: $2.7M 

13) 5-year plan: 50% annual growth
• Year 5 ARR: $9.11M
• Exit options:
a) Sell for 3-5x ARR ($27M - $45M)
b) Keep your cash cow 

14) Buy a tropical island 

15) Tell your grandkids how you turned this YT video into generational wealth 
• Remember: It's not just about ideas, it's about EXECUTION.

okay so today's video I'm going to talk about the clearest path to $10 million of liquid netw worth and I'm just going to outline all the steps going to go through each one going to expand on each one let you know how I'm thinking about all of this let's get a few things out of the way the first is it's really hard to make $10 million it's really hard to make a million dollar it's really hard to make a $1,000 selling something on the internet but this is your my opinion best way to go about it and where the most opportunity is so this is the blueprint this is the Playbook I've seen this [Music] work um and you know a little about me if you don't know me I started and sold three Venture back companies before the age of 30 I was an advisor to Reddit advisor to TI talk I've done the VC thing I've done the bootstrap thing and this Playbook you know why I'm putting it out there is because I think it's going to be helpful to someone um I'm not selling anything um and hopefully it makes the world a better place you can make a little bit more money you can provide for your family um and uh that's why I'm putting it out there so so step one is to pick your Niche I use the example of pick a AI for solo preneurs not business tips the riches are in the N I hate that saying riches are in the niches I actually call niches um my point on this one is I've made this mistake before where I just put like a I create a general business in some topic and picking your Niche is really um picking the right Niche is almost one of the most important things as of this entire list so um I use a few tools to uh figure out how to pick pick your Niche I've talked about some of these before I've used um gummy search before which is built on top of Reddit and uh gives you ideas and pain points on top of Reddit uh you don't need a tool on top of Reddit you can literally just go on Reddit um and you could go into different subreddits and you could see what people are saying I like to go to the top and then pick let's say this month and you can see in this fire Community Financial Independence retire early Community what are people saying and it just gives you this ability to say like okay how can I create a a niche within this Niche so I like Reddit for that uh Google Trends um it's an obvious one but it's so so powerful I don't know why more people don't use it when you have an idea for a niche for example um the fire movement um you can see what's going on and I actually use this other tool called Glimpse which just basically supercharges my um supercharges my Google Trends I'm not affiliated with the with this product or anything like that but I uh just think it's really cool that it gives um just additional Search terms it's acting a bit slow right now there we go so I really like that it says like what is the fire movement um fire movement and health insurance so you know there could be an opportunity to build a whole business around health insurance and within the fire movement um so this this will just you just scroll through all this and this is going to give you ideas on which uh Niche to pick oh the fire movement only for Australia or Canada or France oh my God maybe there's something here so pick your Niche make it Niche actually make it niche the second uh step hit 250,000 Impressions per month one viral hit can do this but consistency wins post daily engage and be the person in your space so some people are going to listen to this and they're going to be like 250,000 Impressions how am I able to do that easy for you to say Greg you have like 400,000 followers well I do this with with a bunch of new accounts and I start from zero and it's totally doable that within 90 days you can start getting 250,000 Impressions per month now it's just about uh understanding your Niche creating content that that Niche is going to share um and then also just replying to other people in that Niche get them to see who you are um and be the person in the space so pick a name uh that's going to really resonate with people um so that then they see your you know they see um you know not necessarily your name when I say name could be a handle but can also be the bio like your bio needs to be really good I actually tweeted about this guy over the weekend who had a great bio and great uh cover photo so his name is Marty bootstrapping a video platform for realtors profits to buy first house Twitter homies get housewarming invite # projectx and then his cover photo is his dream home Zillow sucks $629,000 I mean amazing amazing like you want to root for this guy and that's why you're clicking follow and you know I've never met this guy or anything like that but I just think it's so cool that he he's you know he's doing the The Playbook so hit that 250,000 Impressions a month shh don't tell anyone but I've got 30 plus startup ideas that could make you millions and I'm giving them away for free these aren't just random guesses they're validated Concepts from entrepreneurs who built $100 million plus businesses I've compiled them into one simple database compiled from hundreds of conversations I've had on my podcast but the main thing is most of these ideas don't need a single investor some cost nothing to start I'm pretty much handing you a cheat sheet the idea bank is your startup shortcut just click below to get access your next cash flowing business is waiting for you then what you got to do is convert 05% to leads so you want to convert some of those Impressions to leads uh so about 1200 that'll give you about 1,50 organic leads per month uh what I like to do here is create uh irresistible lead magnets so good they'd be not you know they'd be dumb not to grab it so that can be a calculator could be an ebook could be a video uh you name it just some piece of content that is going to be valuable that you can gatekeep some of the tools that I like to create lead magnets uh it's called one is called gamma. apppp gamma AI um so you can create these like beautiful presentations documents websites you don't need to know how to code or anything like that and then you can gate it um so you can go ahead and gate it um so you can create like put photos and gate it uh videos and gate it charge diagrams gate it there's all these like templates that you can use you can import existing documents and it makes it look really nice so um you you can use something like gamma to create it I uh I have like a bunch of lead magnets on my website Greg e.com um so like for example fine winning startup ideas using Reddit and AI startup ideas bank and how i' start them things that I know that my audience would use and then I just create simple these are framer framer dcom uh landing pages um and look how like simple this is I just put an image through you know bolded the title you know it doesn't need to be fancy but these are lead magnets that convert your impressions and this this uh this adds you know at least five to 10,000 Subs to my newsletter from these things so these things these lead magnets do work once you okay so now we have these leads and the mistake a lot of people make is they don't monetize their leads immediately so what you can do is you know say someone signs up to find winning startup ideas I actually don't do this but I should I could say like hey you could sign up to you should sign up to framer dcom or whatever and I get an affiliate cut to framer decom um and that's just a great way to at least generate you a dollar per lead um so you're what is happening here you're you're getting organic leads every single every single month and now you're getting paid $1 at least you know I'm I'm making up the number a dollar but usually it's it could be 50 cents it could be $3 could be $5 $7 it depends which um which affil like how you're affiliating what what uh like which Affiliates you choose it depends on are we talking uh a very high value customer or low value customer so it depends on that but the point is you can make money from these leads and then what you do is you take that money so let's say it's 1,250 bucks which I think by the way is super conservative here and you uh you buy more leads so you take that $ 12250 and you buy leads at $2 each um which isn't Crazy by the way I you know you should be you can you can easily buy leads on meta for a dollar $2 $3 and now that's bringing you in 625 additional leads per month so now step six hope are you are you following here we got 1875 leads we've got the 1250 organic that we were getting we're getting from you know Twitter Tik Tok Instagram whatever social platform LinkedIn whatever social platform uh you you choose and you think that you know you're great at and then you've got the six you got the 625 you've purchased so now you've created this lead generation machine you've picked a niche like where okay let's take a step back like where are we you've picked a niche that is IDE ideally validated by Google Trends data or Reddit um and it isn't very competitive you have cont Market fit meaning you're creating a type of content that is really resonating with people doesn't mean that you're going viral every day but you're going you know you're going somewhat viral once twice a month you're converting these people into leads meaning they're eventually going to buy your product and you are getting paid per lead um and by the way you can also I talked about you know partnering with software companies or other Affiliates you can also sign up to something like spark Loop um which is I'm sure you've seen this before where it's like you sign up to a newsletter and it's like people who sign up to this newsletter also sign up to these recommended newsletters and basically they'll pay you anywhere between you know 50 cents to $3 for every recommend recommendation that you give to other people so for example you sign up to Greg Eisenberg decom and then I go ahead and recommend the hustle and for every subscription that I give to the hustle they're going to pay me let's say a dollar or $2 so this is that's a form of affiliate as well then you've got all these leads you got the organic over here you've got the paid over here and now you've become this lead generation machine this is like a really good place to be if you can do this in like 120 days you're you're looking really good the next step step is to nurture like crazy so great you have all these leads but if you're not nurturing them they're going to forget about you so you can either do something like a Weekly Newsletter where you're keeping people up to dat uh giving them value left right and Center or you could you know create a community uh you know WhatsApp Community a school Community Facebook group uh most of our communities we run on school it's just it's sort of easy um and you give so much value that they're they feel guilty not paying you basically so you just make them you just Pummel them with value The Next Step uh before you actually you know you haven't built any real products yet so the next step is you ask the community what you can build for them and then you prioritize that those pain points so you ask them okay by the way right now you might have 50,000 leads so you're like hey you know in in a weekly news Eder you're like hey I'm thinking you know what is something you know what are your pain points how can your job be better how can this how can I make you happy how can I entertain you whatever it is I don't know what you're building but you have to figure out what their pain points are and and then you just write that down in a Google doc maybe that's 10 15 30 um of the high of of the you know most valuable pain points um and you pick one right some pain points you won't be able to create software agency Marketplace uh you know a business an info product for them because my point is there's some products that are easier to create and some products that are harder to create so uh you're not going to be able to solve all these pain points and you want to pick a a paino where it's quite easy to solve and easy to build a minimal viable product step nine launch a $30 a month offer aim for $300 plus per customer annually make feel like a no-brainer they're tip to you for all the free value there will be people who sign up to this offer just because you've been in their inbox for six months you've created a free community maybe and you're providing so much value for six months 9 months 12 months and they literally just want to say thank you and they'll buy your product now $300 is ideal you know could it be $200 could it be $400 $500 yes the point here stick with me is directionally you want to basically make a few hundred per customer annually step 10 you convert 3% of total leads which is 56 new customers per month1 1875 that was the total amount of organic and paid into 56 so now you have 56 customers uh and c and you're making cash right um and if you've done one to se one to seven right um this is surprisingly easy um so it is so surprisingly easy because your your offer is quite dialed you have a niche um and they want to pay you step 11 you know year year one where are we at we've got 672 customers it's about 200,000 $21,600 of ARR um so if you times the 56 new customers per month times that by 12 months um you know that that gets you to 672 672 oh no you know it gets you to 672 and 672 * 300 is 2,600 now it might feel small you you might be like wow all that work for $200,000 is a is tough you know I don't know if I want to do that but compounding is the eighth wonder of the world and it's just beginning so don't don't if you get to Step 11 don't give up this is like right when you're about to take off quick ad break let me tell you about a business I invested in it's called boring marketing.com so a few years ago I met this group of people that were some of the best SEO experts in the world they were behind getting some of the biggest companies found on Google and the secret sauce is they've got a set of technology and AI that could help you outrank your competition so for my own businesses I wanted that I didn't want to have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I didn't want to depend on ads to drive customers to my businesses I wanted to rank high in Google that's why why I like SEO and that's why I use boring marketing.com and that's why I invested in it they're so confident in their approach that they offer a 30-day Sprint with 100% money back guarantee who does that nowadays so check it out highly recommend boring marketing.com step 12 reinvest profits in lead buying you're now profitable on each lead buy more turn your funnel into a vending machine the mistake a lot of people make here is they take that 21,000 and they go and buy a Lamborghini or Rolex or whatever don't do that do not do that um take that money to reinvest into your funnel um so you make it a vending machine you've you've created the machine all you have to do is basically pour more gasoline on it so year three we've got 5,000 customers at 1.5 million ARR this is when you can start introducing a higher ticket upsell so uh a premium power upsell to 20% of your power users to maybe let's say $100 a month another 5% to $500 a month so that makes your ARR $2.7 million and and the breakdown there is 4,000 time 300 1,000 time 1,00 250 time 6 $6,000 puts you to $2.7 million step 15 uh five-year growth plan at 50% annual growth which by the way isn't like that much um I'm I wanted to be conservative with all these numbers um so under promise overd deliver here so that year five that brings you to $9.11 million of ARR now you can exit this business now I don't know if this is a software business this is an info product this an agency but I don't think it's crazy to to think that you know you can exit this business three to five times AR which is about $27 million to $45 million um or you could just keep it and enjoy your cash cow you know and there's nothing wrong with that there's absolutely nothing wrong with just saying this is a profitable thing this is kind of like almost like a an apartment building a real estate that you own um except that you never put a huge down payment and you never borrowed money from the bank you just did this thing step by step by step uh step 17 and 18 are fun you know you could by a tropical island and uh step 18 you can tell your grandchildren how you turned a video not really a tweet into gener in generational wealth you you saw this video you you looked at the steps you gave it a like comment and subscribe and uh and it worked for you so I hope this got you thinking I hope this got your creative juices flowing that's what the startup ideas podcast is for it's not just to give you just ideas um because you know it's not just about the ideas it's about executing them and this is a plan for you to execute on some of these ideas so uh thanks for listening and uh see you in the next one

Join me as I chat with Nick Huber, a serial entrepreneur and real estate investor, as we dive into the art of going viral on social media.

If you're looking to boost your social media game and learn strategies that truly work, this episode is packed with actionable insights!

Timestamps: 

00:00 Intro
01:23 The mindset
02:37 The structure of a viral tweet / Example 1
08:29 Example 2
11:26 Example 3
15:38 Example 4 (video content) 
16:46 Example 5
17:22 The importance of priming the algorithm
19:16 Example 6
22:24 Example 7

1) The mindset:
• Don't try to make everyone like you
• Be willing to look silly sometimes
• Have thick skin - you can't please everyone

2) The structure:
• Start with a "wow" statement that sounds unique
• Take a hard line on one side - no nuance
• Back it up with strongly written copy

3) The hook:
• You have 1/8 of a second to grab attention
• Make people laugh, strike emotion, or teach something
• Use numbers and specific details for added humor

4) The controversy:
• Say something different than what most people hear
• Take an un-nuanced stance on a debatable topic
• Trigger people who disagree (respectfully)

5) The follow-up:
• Double down in your second tweet
• Add more context or examples
• Don't backpedal or soften your stance

6) The visuals:
• Use video when possible - algorithms favor it
• Catch attention in the first second

7) The mix:
• Blend personal content, entertainment, and value
• Prime the algorithm with high-engagement tweets
• Follow up bangers with business-related content

8) The authenticity:
• Tweet things you actually believe
• It's okay if not everyone agrees
• Spark good conversations and critical thinking

9) The strategy:
• Build a following of smart people and entrepreneurs
• Use the "jab, jab, jab, right hook" approach
• Leverage high-engagement tweets for business asks

10) The lesson: Nuance doesn't go viral. But thoughtful, controversial takes that make people think?

Nick the man who needs no introduction but I'm going to give you an introduction anyways you have probably more businesses than you have fingers at this point you are running somewhere. comom which is just taking over as a recruiting agency right now you've got probably 100 million bucks in in self storage facilities you got time to be a good father you got time to troll the internet when hundreds of millions of people see it of course you're of course you're coming here and you're sharing some ideas let's do it [Music] man and I wanted to do something a bit different I want to get inside your brain around how you actually craft content that gets people ticking and I don't know if you can just like open up a Google doc and just start like typing out stuff and we can jam on it how ever it works I want to I want to I want people to listen to this and at the end of it understand how you do it how you're able to be in Athens Georgia and get the entire planet uh to jump up with happiness or or pain or or do something you think that works let's do it man I think we can cover A Lot quickly because my strategy is pretty simple I mean the we all know the framework of great Twitter copy but the mindset is a little bit different and the mindset is that if you try to make every single person like you on the internet if you are worried about what people think if you have thin skin it's it's impossible to do well it really is because if you try to make everybody love you nobody will actually have an opinion on you at all is is the truth so if you're not a little bit different if you're not afraid to put yourself out there and if you're afraid to look silly then it's not for you right so I make myself look stupid sometimes is the bottom line I'm going to I'm going to share my screen and I want to go through tweets and I want to just we've never done this together like we we've never you talking some of the real bangers the viral ones yeah why not and and and and also other people's tweets too and just like what makes them great let's just go through it um I'm G to share my screen can you see my screen I can let's go to you for a second which which tweet well let's I'm going to go through maybe a few tweets and you tell me which one you want me to stop at I mean this one has you know 720,000 Impressions like what were you thinking when you tweeted this so the structure you can see it here I make a statement that people say oh wow that sounds unique I'm not sure if I agree with it or not but that's not like what I mostly hear that first line okay then I spend the rest of the Tweet taking a hard line on one side so there's no Nuance there's no teasing out both sides my structure is hey I'm GNA say something boom whe you know obviously there's Nuance obviously there's two sides of it obviously it doesn't apply to everybody but I'm G to act like it does and I'm going to take a very strong side towards one of them that's the structure of a great tweet so something that not everybody agrees with said as fact with conviction and then a bunch of really strongly written copy to back it up that's how almost all of my viral tweets are structured and how were you thinking about this this reply second tweet it's a little small for me let's see here don't don't buy into here I'll I'll actually make it bigger don't buy into this actually can you see better now yeah so I feel like I just feels super passionate about this in general maybe it's cuz I live in the south maybe it's cuz I see a lot of people making the mistake of waiting too long to have children and I'll read the tweet my advice to 25y olds get married young and have more kids than you can afford that's the wow part of the Tweet right everybody reads that and they're like whoa that's the opposite of what I hear I hear marrying your picking your spouse's like you know the most important decision you'll ever make be very careful about it be very deliberate in it be you know super thoughtful on it and kids are super expensive and I need to be financially secure before I have kids like so Boom the thing that Nick said at the very top is different than what a lot of people say then I go on to take a very hard side towards having more kids younger I've never met anyone who wishes they'd had fewer kids that's a super strong unnuanced take supporting my first line but I've met a lot of people who regret waiting so long or having so few every 60 plus year old that I know cares about one thing Above All Else their kids and their grandkids that is just a super powerful convincing thing that's also super triggering to people who disagree with it and what percentage like what percentage true is this tweet I pretty strongly believe so look it's it's it's geared towards my target person obviously not everybody is in the situation where this applies to them right they're people with mental issues they're struggling with alcohol they're literally do not have their own life together and they have no business getting married and trying to support a child but I'm talking to to the people who are like me because that's the majority of people who follow me on the internet are competent people 30 to 40 to 50 years old who are kicking ass at their career they're making money they're into entrepreneurship they're into business and maybe they've just kind of forgot that holy cow kids are super important to live a rewarding life then I make the second tweet don't buy into the illusion of choice because you hear the excuse all the time of guys and girls alike being like I just want to travel I want to get out of my system I want to go live my life and you know do all these things before I have kids and I personally pretty strongly believe that that's and it actually creates a bunch of bad habits that are really hard to break when you actually do want to settle down so my second tweet I just lean in don't buy into the illusion of choice you know don't buy into the lie that is getting out of your system if you travel and sleep around and do whatever you want for 20 years it'll be even harder for you bad habits die hard and that just it just lights people up right I think the the strategy by the way of like double Downing on your second line always hits hard yep yeah catchy catchy little intro my advice to every 25y old okay I'm going to read this because I want to know what Nick advises 25 year olds and then boom a super strong controversial Viewpoint and then me taking one side even though if I were in a conversation with somebody you discuss the Nuance like right we can we can discuss the Nuance of this right now that having kids is not right for everybody but I do think a lot of people make this mistake so my goal with this was to make people think twice about it totally and by the way for for for this pod like it's okay what we're talking about right now is how to create content that goes viral so we're not talking about nuances and stuff like that it's really just about how you're structuring it and what the insights are right yeah Nuance um the lesson here is that Nuance does not go viral yeah Nuance does not go viral all right I'm to continue scrolling and then let me know uh when I should stop yeah I'll scroll too shh don't tell anyone but I've got 30 plus startup ideas that could make you millions and I'm giving them away for free these aren't just random guesses they're validated Concepts from entrepreneurs who built hundred million plus businesses I compiled them into one simple database compiled from hundreds of conversations I've had on my podcast but the main thing is most of these ideas don't need a single investor some cost nothing to start I'm pretty much handing you a cheat sheet the idea bank is your startup shortcut just click below to get access your next cash flowing business is waiting for you oh this is a good one dude okay could you do this one yeah all you have to do is refuse video games until about the age of 16 then your kids will be so far behind their friends it won't be fun for them they'll give up and focus on real life virtually no chance they'll grow old to spend 20 hours a week on a computer casting spells it's a say uh it triggers all the people who sit around and play video games as a hobby because it's true that video games while they do add a lot of critical thinking skills and maybe people argue hand eye coordination I disagree with that but um they argue the benefits of it I don't think they're very beneficial so I took that hard line and it it frustrated and made Angry a lot of uh Gamers yeah and the reality is you actually believe this you know and so it's like you're twe things that you believe which I think is whether I agree with you or not like I actually disagree with you but I know that you believe this because I remember texting some you know you I was like I played video games today and you're like basically why um but it's cool that we can still be friends and just have differing opinions you know um I get a lot of messages I get a lot of messages from people who support me and follow me and want to and want to use my businesses and they the first thing a lot of them say to me is I love I love your stuff and I don't agree with all of it right I spark good conversations I make smart people think critically about things and obviously that what I think doesn't apply to everybody so throw out the stuff that doesn't apply to you but I guarantee you some of the stuff might strike home with you how important is putting numbers in tweets yeah I think I have this one tweet about a white Escalade like if you want to the more if you can get really specific and it adds just a layer of humor like 20 hours a week on a computer casting spells just adds a layer of humor to the thought of like somebody it's somebody playing World of Warcraft it's that you picture that guy on South Park who's got his hand up on the desk and he's and he's really obese and he's eating chips while he's beating Cartman and their and all the friends at World of Warcraft right that's what you picture when you think of you know 20 20 hours a week casting spells so I I like to add a little bit of complexity I have this one tweet about salespeople and driving a white Escalade like I love to hire salespeople who are paycheck to paycheck but drive $120,000 white Escalade because they're super motivated to sell and they are highly determined to make it rain and they'll work super hard because they're cash strapped and it's just funny because we all know a lot of sales people like that um this isn't let's talk about Marshall this this one that you retweeted here why do you think uh why do you think this one blew up this was I actually I actually workshopped that with Marshall so we worked on that one together um because it's it's a promotion for somewhere. comom but I think that it's the same structure that we are talking about at the beginning okay we have a line at the top is just the wow factor right of like I should read this it's catchy it's the hook I sold my company For $52 million earlier this year that's the first line that says says Hey drop what you're doing and read the rest of this tweet because in reality somebody scrolling Twitter you get an eighth of a second of their attention you have to realize that like they are selfishly scrolling Twitter being like what can you do for me what can you do for me what can you do for me are you g to make me laugh are you going to make are you going to strike my emotion or are you going to teach me something those are the three things are you going to make me laugh or be entertaining in some way or are you gonna are you going to teach me something so you're trying to stop them in their tracks with that very first line just like my advice to every 25-year-old oh I might want advice because I might be I might have a kid who turns 25 or I just might be interested in this boom Marshalls I sold my company For $52 million not very many people done that I'm going to read I'm going to give it more than eighth of a second I'm going to give it four seconds so now you have four seconds and it's the the controversial part right my secret weapon I had two Americans on my team and 150 plus International Folks at the time of the sale wow Not only was this a remote company but 1% of his employees were us-based and 99% of employees his employees were overseas Finance Ops sales and then the rest of it we're selling right we're we're telling people what somewhere offers Finance people operations people salese developers even Executives and then bang this is the catchy one all for 80% less than us Talent you can do this too here are seven people ready to hire today that tweet got 1.4 million impressions and it drove 100 plus leads to somewhere. comom and it was worth a quarter million dollars of marketing for us and it was fre insane insane that's crazy and you did something else that was really smart here which is you could have just put higher sales people for $1,800 $100 a month but you did this can you explain why yeah we made it so that these people can see and like hear the voice of who they could potentially hire because everybody a business owner thinks oh I might hire somebody abroad and they think of what they get on the phone when they talk to a Filipino who works for Bank of America and they're like damn I really hope this person can actually help me but it's unlikely they're going to forward me around a culry and it's going to be kind of tough because Corporate America has trained us to think a certain type of person who works overseas but if you play Keegan's video he sounds like us he sounds like an American so yeah it's it's really it's really pretty cool so when they see that and they feel it it's uh it hits different and it sells much more effectively yeah and the platforms are optimized more for video now so I think it also just you know you're feeding the Beast the algorithm Beast as well you you mentioned something that's so important actually this is this is really hard because Twitter is changing so fast and I think Elon is Elon knows what he's doing and he's chasing engagement chasing daily active users and it's going to point him towards a Tik Tock Instagram type model so I'm worried that we're going all video over time on Twitter so it's kind of scary for guys like me what do you think well well I agree um just cuz the ad dollars are also in video but you seem to be like leaning into video right here like this this is working like I don't see many videos that have 700 likes how how do you what did you do here did you script this out um how important is the background talk walk me through your thinking on this one yeah so I recorded a 52 second video can you can you scroll just the very beginning of it so I can read that yeah um I can't remember exactly what I filmed what I said in this video oh yeah I'm saying repeat after me I will keep keep it simple I will copy what works and we're going to talk about this in the second half of our of our episode which is a maybe a pretty cool transition but yeah my videoos the exact same thing it's catchy because I have when when somebody's scrolling Instagram or Twitter I have one second of their attention so I have to catch it right away so let me tell you my advice to every entrepreneur in this world copy what works I will do boring things I will um you know avoid what's sexy I'll stop chasing everything that everybody else is chasing in the the world and I'm going to simplify it and I'm going to do boring things and the people who have succeeded in entrepreneurship most of them can really relate to that so that's why it took off very cool all right let's do one or two more uh bangers maybe this one three names you never share yeah it like I I I I just have a I wouldn't say it's a natural gift to be funny with word or anything I don't know if it's funny but it does hook so yeah three names you never share your babysitter your house cleaner and your attorney I've learned my lesson on all three and it's just funny this is a funny tweet because you really you cannot share your babysitter in the group chat or you will not be able to secure your babysitter next Friday when you need your babysitter and and you know someone's probably listening to this and and and thinking like why is Nick posting this how is this going to actually make his businesses better so you know what's the what's the ROI of of a tweet like this I think it's a it's a mix right most of my tweets are just trying to get smart people to think maybe there's some entertainment maybe there's some personal stuff to get people to know me and then there's trying to get smart people to think more critically about something and if I can get smart people and entrepreneurs to follow me then when I post a tweet like the one Marshall tweeted about International Talent um I'll be able to get $250,000 worth of business in the door that way so it's just a it's just a a constant process of trying to get attention trying to add value trying to make smart people think critically about something and then you ask it's the Gary ve jab jab jab jab jab Right Hook and the right hook is the ask hey let's do business pay me money for recruiting services or whatever yeah really it does really Prime the algorithm so if you do hit like a banger like this gets 1 th000 likes your next tweet uh maybe it's a lead magnet maybe it's something else but it does it does work more you'll notice it like if you if you click at somebody's tweet on Twitter you're going to see another one of their tweets the next time you open the app and start scrolling but if you scroll right by four people's twe you know one person's tweet four times you'll see that the Apple realized hey I don't want to see Nick anymore because you just scrolled past five of his ideas so I'm not going to show you his next couple so it really does prime the algorithm and your next tweet after a really high engagement tweet will get a lot of Engagement so you can use that to your advantage okay I want to do this last one from from you and then after this I want you to pick one Creator and we're going to like kind of look at one or two of their of their posts okay n Nikita is a genius copywriter so I pick him cool this football one what do you what were you thinking when you when you tweeted this I just talk a lot about how I think football is brutal on the brain and I'm not going to let my kids play it um and then I just see a kid here get laid out and obviously can cussed as a 5-year-old and it's sickening so just spreading just trying to spread I'm I'm not I don't have an agenda for engagement with this one I'm literally trying to talk other 35y olds like me to not let their play football right totally I I will also say like the quote retweet this is like a it does work a lot in the algorithm these days um you find something uh and then you can just you know add your POV on top of it and a lot of times it goes viral yeah you know who's good at that levels IO I don't know if you follow him Peter levels yep but he uh he's a massive quote retweeter so he like probably about 20% to 30% actually maybe more is him just quote retweeting and he gets massive engagement yeah he has the same strategy as me I think he has a lot of people who totally dislike him because he has what some people would call radical views just like I do but he stands behind his actual opinion and he's done the work to build his own opinions so I think he also gains a lot of respect so I think it's been a massive part of him building his brand is to not being afraid to ruffle some feathers totally yeah he went on the uh Lex Freedman podcast and basically um talked about PHP and like this a language that no not many people sort of write in and he he writes in it and and it's just it's a dividing thing to say that just like oh yeah just build something in PHP so I think he believes the stuff but he also does it to ruffle some feathers for sure quick ad break let me tell you about a business I invested in it's called boring marketing.com so a few years ago I met this group of people that were some of the best SEO experts in the world they were behind getting some of the biggest companies found on Google and the secret sauce is they've got a set of technology and AI that could help you outrank your competition so for my own businesses I wanted that I didn't want to have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I didn't want to depend on ads to drive customers to my businesses I wanted to rank high in Google that's why I like SEO and that's why I use boring marketing.com and that's why I invested in it they're so confident in their approach that they offer a 30-day Sprint with 100% money back guarantee who does that nowadays so check it out highly recommend boring marketing.com okay this one Nik work on Twitter Nikita's work on Twitter has just been unbelievable I mean he writes so well his copy is so good like if you want to study copywriting forget me look at Nikita look at the way he structures obviously it's impossible to remake what Nikita does because he's so clever with his jokes not everybody is like a has the mind of a comedian but he's also brilliant when it comes to building consumer apps so he's built this reputation online where he is the guy to go to in the tech in the Tech Community when it comes to verality and consumer apps so he has just massive massive respect like here here we have Elon like obviously following Nikita I would not be surprised if those two get dinner soon he it's just leveling up his entire career because of the reputation that he's built on Twitter which is just it's awesome to see I'm so happy for him 100% yeah this is this is just so good a lot of his stuff is like very it's like not a lot of words too right yeah he doesn't do any threads or a couple threads but most of them and he and he's the perfect mix of like hey I'm going to show you how serious I am and how good I am when it comes to building consumer apps with a really thoughtful thing to say like on September 17th which is yesterday he tweeted about seating an app with users like he just gave a really good insight for people who are actually building apps and to get a really value falling of actual entrepreneurs and then right after that it's a my a huge joke about how European how how aggressive Europeans are about sexual advances and if they put an emoji in a tweet that means they're coming on to you only Nikita can follow up a tweet about seeding an app with users with hey here's how Europeans are coming on to you in a tweet in a in a message it's just hilarious yeah homies got range for sure absolutely I'm gonna put together just some takeaways I'll probably put in the comment section on YouTube around just like how how to how to tweet like Nick how to tweet like Nikita um cool um well Nick thanks for taking us through your mind there um [Music] baby

32:16 Final thoughts

1) YouTube is eating all media:
• 99% of TV shows would flop on YouTube
• Platform-specific content is crucial
• MrBeast: "We are not Hollywood"

2) A-player mentality:
• Only hire obsessive, coachable people
• B-players can be trained, C-players must go
• "There's only room for A-players here"

3) Re-engagement strategy:
• Hook viewers at 3-minute mark
• Use spectacles that only MrBeast can do
• Example: Carl watching Josh in prison video

4)  Data-driven content:
• Creators are data scientists, not just entertainers
• 60M views = same as presidential debate
• Obsess over audience retention graphs

5) Constraints fuel creativity:
• Don't rely on big budgets
• Example: Year's supply of Doritos is more engaging than $20k cash
• "Creativity is the answer, not money"

6)  Communication is key:
• Define when to use in-person, email, or text
• No excuses, move on mentality
• "Late" isn't in MrBeast's dictionary

7) Consultants are cheat codes:
• Leverage expert knowledge
• Example: Call previous world record holder
• "Consultants are a gift from God"

8) Brand deal integration:
• Make ads part of the content
• Avoid boring, scripted brand mentions
• Goal: No viewer realizes it's an ad

so Mr Beast how to succeed in Mr BEAST's production document just leaked and I think it's actually really interesting read think that if you're a Creator you're an entrepreneur you're a Founder you work in a company it's worth the read love him or hate the guy I just think that there's something that you can take from this and I posted it on Twitter it got like a million views 10,000 bookmarks so today let's get through my unfiltered analysis reactions of the newly leaked Mr Beast production [Music] document so I'm not going to read you all of this you guys can read yourself while I'm talking but I think I'm just going to give you my reaction to all 36 pages and what I find most interesting so vers is he doesn't call this a rule book you say this is not a rule book um and it's not just like a bunch of hey you need to follow these things um but I I find the most interesting thing is he's so casual about the whole thing I feel like it's a friend of mine who's writing to me and I'm just reading it it's like almost like he's texting me this uh he even calls out that there's grammar issues um and I think that's really powerful it feels like he just like had a pot of coffee one night I can just like picture it now and he just just started writing and and and then he he like published this so I think that more companies should do this have their Founders um just just write what they're feeling about uh you know how to do XYZ let me take a sip let me gu I'm drinking cocacola Oreo Edition don't ask me why I'm trying it and uh yeah I'm not sponsored obviously but it it kind of slaps okay so that is page two let's go to page three so he he says something here that's really interesting he said I can make a separate book for Creative a separate book for production a separate book for editors but I think that'd be dumb I actually would kill to see what those separate books would look like but I understand his point his point is this is a book for everyone here but I do think I I would I would love to see that and I wonder what you think would be in some of those books too I love how clear the goal is for this whole document he says uh M you know our goal here is to make the best videos possible all companies need this all companies need just a really clear goal in English or whatever language but like sixth grade fifth grade fourth you know seventh grade just really easy easy to understand but this document is so simple that even a child could read it um and probably because some children probably are reading this like and I mean I'm joking obviously not children but young people are reading this he makes it really really simple so page four he says 99% of movies or TV shows would flop on YouTube now that sounds really obvious when he says it um but I never thought of it that way um I guess yes every medium is different what works on mobile you know what works on different social platforms don't necessarily work on each other so um the fact that Jimmy we'll call him Jimmy even though I think there's two people on the on the planet you either call Mr Beast Mr Beast or you call Mr Beast Jimmy uh you know what I'm not calling him Jimmy we're gonna keep it I'm gonna call him Mr Beast because that's that's how you know I don't know him personally that well um although I have dm'd with him a couple times all right Mr Beast he's got that YouTube blueprint right um and I think that def saying that to everyone that you know we are not Hollywood or different um what works there won't work here I think is really really smart he says something at the bottom which I don't know about um he talks about you're either an a player B player or C player there's only room in this company for a players a players are obsessive learn from mistakes coachable intelligent don't make excuses believe in YouTube uh B players are people that need to be trained into a players C players are just average employees if you're a junior a player I don't know could you be on Mr bast's team does you know does he does that not work I don't really understand his his Vibe here and I think that there's some people that just are you know they don't come out of the womb as a players right they need to be groomed and stuff like that so uh I feels like a bit much I get his point but let me know in the comments what you think of that comment page five okay this is interesting so here here he explains how to go viral uh on YouTube in just a few words so that's really cool he just like breaks down like this could be a hundred Pages he breaks it down into basically one page so on one hand I think it's genius um on the other hand I actually don't believe this applies to all video creators um for example me myself I create Niche B2B business content I create content around how to come up with startup ideas and tactics in terms of taking our ideas and shipping them some of my best videos are literally like two hours long and and with like very little preparation just like live cooking I mean this video who knows maybe this video gets a million views but it's literally just me talking about you know reacting to something and it's not like super super optimized at all so um I think for niches I'm going to have to disagree with you Mr Beast um but uh for maybe if you want to be for everything if you want to be a top 10 video creator uh I do think he's right shh don't tell anyone but I've got 30 plus startup ideas that could make you millions and I'm giving them away for free these aren't just random guesses they're validated Concepts from on entrepreneurs who built hundred million plus businesses I've compiled them into a one simple database compiled from hundreds of conversations I've had on my podcast but the main thing is most of these ideas don't need a single investor some cost nothing to start I'm pretty much handing you a cheat cheet the idea bank is your startup shortcut just click below to get access your next cash flowing business is waiting for you page six I looked at this this is a a key moments for audian retention and really the big thing that stuck out to me was that 60 million people clicked on his video uh 60 million people uh we just had the debate uh in the US here uh you know Donald Trump C Camala har Harris and that's like about the same amount of people who watch that debate who watch this Mr Beast video there's more people who watch this video than live in Canada the second biggest country on the planet so that's crazy scale um was also a big reminder to me that uh you know I used to think of YouTube creators as entertainers but they're actually more like data scientists uh than they are entertainers so uh when I'm talk when you look at the top hundred YouTube creators they are obsessing over the data um and uh I think uh that was quite quite an interesting takeaway from this one uh page seven here I just I'm calling out Mr Beast like why isn't Mr Beast building the Y combinator of creators like you know as you're reading this you you'll see it's if he understands how to make people go viral and distribution is more important than product now it's just from uh it's just easy you know it's hard it's easier to build product you can use like AI tools and and other software to go and create those products um but it's harder to get distribution so I just don't really like why is he selling a Lunchables competitor right now with KSI and Logan Paul which you got tons of backlash for um when he could be building the Y combinator of creators Building Products software um and owning piece of them um the other the other reaction I have to this is the idea of re-engagement makes so much sense but I had never thought about it when he writes the you know in here when he talks about re-engagement um I just think that that concept it's smart and he's a smart guy he gets it um and he defines it over here we also want to do something around the three minute Mark called a three minute re-engagement a re-engage re-engagement can be described as content that is highly interested that fits the story and makes people genuinely impressed another way to look at this is if it's if it's a segment that only Mr Beast can do this it's important to re-engage the viewer around this time because they could get bored of the story and clicked off these re-engagement are usually spectacles and sometimes needs lots of time and money to perfect which by the way is a bit of his moat uh not a bit of his own it's his moat so it's it's interesting that he calls us out a good example of a re-engagement is when Carl was put in charge watching Josh in the 10,000 everyday you survive prison video page eight you know I'm reading this and especially now that I'm eight pages deep I'm like I love that this guy Mr Beast defines his own language you've got re-engagement you've got LOL Etc uh this is really a Hallmark of someone who is exceptional a Founder who's exceptional and I actually had an opportunity when I was about 20 one or two to be in a room with uh a founder of a billion doll e-commerce startup he was the one who told me that I was in this brainstorm and I was like the young person there um you know supposed to you know giving advice on social media at the time and uh we we W I just wanted to get right into it and he was like like kid stop stop because we need to Define what you know so we're all on the same page these five or six different words we can get to uh we can get we can get to our goal and so here you are Mr Beast doing the same thing um and I do really like it so in your life too by the way Define these things number nine page nine so look at this this is literally like the product requirements for a software product so I'll read a little bit the shape of the audience retention graph can tell you which part of your video are most and least engaging to viewers when the line is flat it means viewers are watching that part of your video from start to finish gradual declines me viewers uh viewers are losing interest over time all videos on YouTube generally taper off during the playback period spikes appear when more viewers are watching rewatching or sharing those uh parts of your videos and dips when viewers are abandoning or skipping point is someone should build software that looks at data like this and gives you insights and and says you should do the following things um and maybe that's view stats which is Mr B's software creator analytics company um maybe that's where he's going with it but I think that opportunity is it's a billion dollar opportunity there's no question about it page 10 so he he keeps talking about this he keeps talking about being obsessed with YouTube basically no matter what apartment you're in is a prequisite uh to work here and I don't think he's wrong I just want to put that out there I don't think he's wrong at all I think it's really interesting gets me thinking of my own companies how do you know what what do what does someone need to be obsessed with what is the one thing that they need to be obsessed with in order for us to be exceptional at our work that's my reaction to this page I also have big points for him using haha in the dock keeping it casual my guy keeping it casual page 12 we're about a third of the way through we're almost through when I read something like this this is a man of Excellence late is the word late is not in his dictionary um and this whole page really is about you know don't be late and it's your fault and uh you know it's important to have bias for Action meaning it's important to actually go and do things that you said you were going to do um and you can't blame people um and and he he just has zero tolerance for it um which makes me just believe I'm not surprised how he's able to pull off what he's able to pull off um and you can tell how seriously just by reading this you can really tell how seriously he takes this page 13 I mean this is a massive block of text seems stressful but I get it uh I like that he said he wasn't perfect here you know we see some Humanity here you know he he says he's not perfect I think that's an important thing to say and I think I'm sure some people work for him and probably most people who work for him they look at Mr Beast as almost like a god you know and it's it's it's great that he he said that he's not perfect he gets stressed and I think that when he lays it out like this it's just going to make his company run so much smoother because they're just going to you know you're reading this and you're like okay I kind of get this guy you know here I am working three you know he says here I am basically three doing three full-time jobs all by myself little things like sending videos to people for birthdays attending events networking all Etc all add up because I'm the face of the channel on top of that I'm you know on top of being the main talent I have to work with each channel to make sure the creatives are basically evolving and not getting stale and in general be a Visionary for them basically running four channels at a high level better than anyone else in the world can run one we also have Beast Burger febles now he has his Lunchables thing and I still have to set the vision and be the lead in Creative so he's got all these things you know it's a lot going on and uh it's tough I get it I'm sure there's people listening to this that are like boohoo uh Mr Beast um what a tough life you live but uh I mean listen he's playing the he's in the Olympics right he's he's uh he's doing it and uh it's important that Founders communicate what's going through their mind and here he is doing that so I do commend him for that uh this whole page 15 I would have titled it creativity uh constraints fuel creativity um he basically just talks about how you know don't don't go over budget you know here I'll I'll I'll I'll I'll talk I I'll say a little bit of it I don't think it comes to a surprise when I say we don't have unlimited money here actually by the way I think some people think that there is unlimited money so it's good that he said that uh we can't have every video constantly going over budget because the money has to come from somewhere but you're in a tough spot because I constantly want better and better videos by the way this is kind of like there's like a vend diagram which is like the worst client which is I want things like cheap fast and good good cheap and fast he wants Jimmy Mr Beast wants things good cheap and fast well that's tough um that's a tough client so sorry um miss you know employees um people always assume money is the answer and we just spend more money we can give what Jimmy wants which is wrong creativity is the answer here is an example I use all the time about our gaming team basically they love to give away money every video but which sounds cooler to you as a prize for a gaming video $20,000 or a year supply of Doritos to me dor Doritos is much funnier so constraint fuels creativity he wants people to come up with great ideas totally get it um that's my little edit to this slide that's what I would have said um and uh I agree with him I mean if I'm trying to create creative ideas I I want the most creative ideas page 16 backup day no one will ever have 100% success rate when when it comes to filming our videos on time and on budget it's impossible you can still do certain things that increase your probability of success uh and one of those is having a backup day uh just something I had never heard of but makes a lot of sense basic no basically the idea is uh have some buffer room you know if uh you need to deliver on a t on a on a Tuesday uh uh you want to make sure that you can extend to a Wednesday um if something were to go wrong uh and you can make up for it so where is the idea of backup da in my whole life love it smart move um this just when you're reading this you you know that Mr Beast has has gone into some tight situations where things got crazy he probably spent a million dollars on a set and all these people and they weren't able to finish it and the owner of the Chateau says sorry you got to be out at 8:00 a.m. tomorrow so um he's talking from experience I think that was a good slide this could be one of the more interesting pages of the entire document um and basically he talks about how to communicate with other people um and most people don't understand communication and most companies are pretty bad at communication they don't Define what you're supposed to do when you're supposed to do it so I love how he bre breaks it down when to do inperson communication when to do email how to think about text no excuses move on simple I love it I think that you know every every company needs something like this um and it felt very human and you know reading it so I thought this was really cool this was surprising this is probably one of the more surprising uh pages in the entire document he talks about Consultants uh Consultants are literally cheat codes need to make the world's largest slice of cake start off by calling the person who made the previous world's large largest slice of the cake lol love how he puts LOL there he's already done countless tests and can save you weeks of work I really want to drill this point home because I'm a massive believer in Consultants because I spent a decade of my life hyper obsessing over YouTube I can now I can show a brand new Creator on how to go from 100 subscribers to 10,000 in a month on their own it would take them years to do it but Consultants are gift from God said no one ever I don't think uh please take advantage of them and every single freaking task assigned to you always always ask yourself if you can find a consultant to help you thought this was interesting um I also tend to use you know I don't I don't call them really Consultants um they're they're experts right you you of course you're trying to accelerate whatever it is you're doing as fast as possible uh get the person that's done the thing that you're trying to do um I don't think what he means here is hire McKenzie or hire BCG uh I think what he means is higher experts um and I think uh I think he's right quick ad break let me tell you about a business I invested in it's called boring marketing.com so a few years ago I met this group of people that were some of the best SEO experts in the world they were behind getting some of the biggest companies found on Google and the secret sauce is they've got a set of technology and AI that could help you outrank your competition so for my own businesses I wanted that I didn't want to have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I didn't want to depend on ads to drive customers to my businesses I wanted to rank high in Google that's why I like SEO and that's why I use boring marketing.com and that's why I invested in it they're so confident in their approach that they offer a 30-day Sprint with 100% money back guarantee who does that nowadays so check it out highly recommend boring marketing.com page 19 so this was uh this is a weird one this a weird page so no does not mean no so what he's saying here is basically you have to do everything you can to do the best possible thing for the experience uh for the business uh and just push through things so if you get a no let's say you know you can't film here you have to keep going and you have to say of course you know what can I do to film here you know don't take no for an answer is basically what he's saying um I agree with him like you you want that startup mentality at the same time you don't want to hurt other people of course um so so I would say I agree with the spirit of it and I just think I would have put a little asteris um it could get a bit hairy there and and and make people feel uncomfortable so I wonder if you you know let me know if you agree with me there page 20 this this this a short page but the takeaway he leads his company in a very Merit meritocratic way uh if you get him a one on 10 uh on YouTube Studio which means you know your your video is really outperforming he'll love you so uh he just he wants the best and he's data driven so if you're number one and you're helping uh this is a guy who who's going to go up to bat for you it's my my lesson learned there page 21 so I this is his it's cool actually that you can see this so these are uh his top 10 videos in the first 45 days the fact that like 44 days the fact that he's getting like 198 million on his first one and 39 million on 10 is really interesting to see um the variety and like the the lesson here is that and and I've actually been learning this myself as as I'm spending more time on YouTube is you know it's very YouTube is like a hits driven social app um so you can see here this is like the squid game in real life outperforming so much you know we're talking five times basically that's a big deal it's a big deal so I you know for him this is like the difference between making a lot of money and probably losing money um and then like when I look at my own like these are my recent videos I know I'm a small small YouTuber subscribe if uh want to make you know if you're enjoying stuff like this but you want more of it um it's it's it's interesting I have like a similar um hit driven model like I got a few at the top and then these are you know underperforming so uh it's interesting that the reason why I bring this up is you're if you're a small YouTube Creator you have this this is relevant this whole document is relevant because he's having the same problems that we are all having and he's got big numbers man I just you know what what what clicked for me after after reading this starting you know this page and the last page is the difference between a title and a thumbnail is is difference between millions of views and so he talked about like titling something ketchup before um and just these little changes in in title make a really big difference and these little changes on um thumbnail make a big difference and it just makes sense that he's just he's like an AB testing go God that's what he does I also when when I when I saw this together all these together it was interesting because they're like basically all the same thumbnail it's like all the same thumbnail with like a different image here related to the video so this is kind of interesting if you're creating thumbnails like maybe I think most of my thumbnails have like right I'm on the right side like they're not on the left side like maybe you should copy Mr Beast because this is probably working okay 23 random things that you should know there was one thing that bothered me about this page I think could be worded in a better way so he says I'd rather you be honest with each other than nice to each other and he's talking about people on set I think you can be honest and nice and I think that you could create a more productive working environment and a happier world if you do that so I think it's I like Mr Beast I like that you want people to be direct you want people to be clear you want people to be honest at the same time I think the the way you know you want do that in a pleasant positive way um or else that's not a fun work environment and that yeah it just kind of sucks so uh I'm I'm gonna assume that you you mean that um on this one because I I do think that people can be honest and nice um I do think that I you know I really like here uh he says me like simple the simpler the better the better apply with the grain of salt in caps but he keeps driving this point around simplic home um and I really really like that page 24 when he does when he goes in bold he he's basically like writing out things like almost like tweetable things and and just like bangers like um yeah you know the biggest like takeaway for me is when I'm reading something like this is what would be the difference in the quality of Mr be's videos if people worked 40 to 60 hours a week just you know 60 hours a week is still working like really hard instead of 100 hours you know I'm not an all nighter guy I work hard but I do not believe in all nighters my uh I started and sold three companies before the age of 30 and I don't think I've worked more than uh you know 40 to 50 hours a week I just don't believe in it I think that um I'm not even talking about you know I just yeah I don't I think that I need like reset time in order to be creative so so um I don't know I think uh I think great work can be done in a standard work week if you work hard and if not something is broken so biggest takeaway for page 25 is is he says what is the goal of our content he and Mr Beast responds to excite me the goal of our content is to excite me I just didn't expect him to say that I thought he would be talk about like there's all these people and we want to make them happy and people people love our content I did not expect for him to just talk about himself on page 25 so page 27 um you know he's talking about one video has 120 million views the other has 45 Mill million views look at these retention numbers and see if you can pick which one got triple the views the point is he's back to data um and I love it I love that he's so data driven that was a huge surprise for me but I was wondering why there's no top you know there's no talk around a metric around comments and positivity around the comments I know for myself when I create a piece of content yes I look at retention yes I look at you know views yes I look at subscribers but the first thing I honestly look at is to see who's commenting what are they saying um are they enjoying it um and I don't know I didn't get any of that from so what am I missing this was really interesting um so he on page 32 adds his content he basically says if you watch a lot of YouTube you'll probably notice that when someone does a brand deal it's boring and sounds like they're reading a script we take a different approach to Brand deals um we like to integrate them and then he shows what happens uh where the brain with the with the brand deal so I just think that um this you know we all know that people skip advertisements um but if you can make it really exciting and make it a part of the content and just have no Creator that's when you're winning so that's what everyone should be focused on so we got a few more pages um this is where I gets a bit unhinged so HR definitely did not review this doc um and you know I'll give you an example if Talent wants to draw a dick on the whiteboard in the video or do something stupid let them assume they know all the risk and aren't missing contexts on why it's not safe uh help them be idiots I don't know um being stupid and having fun definitely I get that part of the shtick but I can imagine that could offend people or go the wrong way understand his point and why it's important to the content but I don't think it lays out a culture that most people would want so I don't know if this scales and this seems like this can go bad that's just my gut reaction and then the last page your career last but not least he talks about people you know the people that who work for him um and uh he basically says that he's going to make you rich uh if you do well um and you create you know you're exceptional at what you do um you will be rich if you work for Mr Beast basically is what he's saying um and and you'll make more money than you could ever dream of making at any other company so he puts that in words he puts that in writing and uh my reaction to that is I hear like the sentiment I get I think sentiment I get is just I don't know when I hear people saying stuff like that I'm kind of like okay what does that mean for me does that mean I'm G to own 0.1% or 0.1 you know one 2% but I mean he can fire me at any time like I don't know what it really means but the sentiment around this is a big opportunity if you do your job well uh you know this is going to be big I totally get and and he isn't he isn't wrong on that you know if you stay there and I'm sure if you do a good job you probably you probably will be able to to crush it for him and and that's the document and I enjoyed reading it of course I didn't agree with everything that' be foolish um but it definitely got me thinking about how to build a how to build a how to build build on YouTube how to build a Content driven business how to think about in you know uh getting your employees your team on the same page um and got me thinking I want to create a a a I know it's not a rule book a not rule book rule book um a culture document for for my team so um I hope you got something out of this hope that got your creative juices flowing um and if it did and you've retained and you've made it here average few durations long uh hit hit us up uh with a like and a comment and a subscribe and uh I'll see you next time it's been real [Music]

1) Startup Idea 1: Collectible Pokemon iPhone Case
• Combines collectibility and utility
• A product’s utility is the best way to standout on the interet
• Tap into current trends to leverage the zeitgeist

2) TikTok Shop is a game-changer:
• Scale through affiliate creators
• Brands pay $1,500-$2,500/month retainer
• Creators earn 20% commission on sales
"Kids aged 20-25 are making 10-25k/month off these commissions" - Oren

3) The power of creator communities:
• Discord channels like "Your First Dollar"
• Brands recruit creators for TikTok Shop
• Learn video creation, hooks, and editing
Pro tip: Brands can find pre-trained creators here 

4) TikTok Shop success formula:
• Wide demographic reach
• Multiple creators across age/race/gender
• Leverage Amazon for fulfillment
Example: Goalie (gummy brand) offering Rolex, Lamborghini as affiliate incentives 

5) Content creation golden rule:
• Provide saveable, shareable value
• Entertain (replace Netflix experience)
• Or fail
"So many people fall in that third bucket because they go say, I'm going to talk about my brand story" - Oren

6) TikTok vs Youtube:
• TikTok algo allows for hyper-specific targeting
• TikTok has wider reach than YouTube for niche products
• Youtube is a less direct sales driver
• Youtube is great for brand building
• Long-form content still valuable
Hot take: "YouTube as a primary sales driver for most businesses" is outdated

7) Oren's content creation philosophy:
• 1) Value 2)entertainment 3)brand story
• Tell stories, not just facts
• Create content people want to bookmark
• Focus on your area of expertise
"I want your director to drop it in the Slack channel and be like, why aren't we doing this?" - Oren

I interviewed Orin Meets World this guy has worked with everyone from Red Bull to sarro you name it but that's not why he's interesting he's interesting because he has nailed Tik Tok and he has nailed how to create content that spreads to millions of people Tik Tok shop I didn't know much about it he taught me and he's going to teach you enjoy this episode the start it's sipping time baby [Music] all right new character unlocked Orin the internet's creative director welcome man I'm excited to be here let's uh let's rip some ideas you know okay I want to run this is a startup ideas podcast so I'm G to run an idea by you anyone could take it you can take it for for all I care um and I want to Workshop it and and just get into your brain to see how you would take this idea and turn it into a cult brand with me let's roll so here's the idea I have a iPhone case it's kind of actually kind of falling apart it's just black it's not that interesting I will say I used to just have no iPhone case and I would crack it and crack it and crack it so I've I've given up you know for the people in the comment section who are gonna be like oh you know I can't believe he has an iPhone case can't believe he's one of those people like I've given up on it you know it's so you feel me on that yeah I was going to say I was going to hold up uh I was going to take my phone out of its case because I adopted the case purely because it's been absolutely destroyed in the same way I just gotta stop I gotta stop doing it and so I'm in the same exact boat brother dude once you hit like I don't know late 20s early 30s you're just like I can't do it anymore yeah as soon as kids are involved man phone's breaking no matter what exactly so uh the idea is how can you make the case a little a little more fun and like a lot of us you know I'm into Collectibles and I was thinking oh wouldn't it be cool if you can have a case and in the back of the case there'd be like a chariz a a holographic Charizard so it's basically marrying a collectible with uh with the case and you're able to make a premium on it because obviously let's say you're buying okay Charizard is probably a bad example because there's some Charizards that go for like $30,000 but there are like I don't know maybe it's a Squirtle or something like that um which you can put in buy it for $20 it cost you $5 to make the case and you sell it for $75 what do you think definitely intrigued I do it is funny you mentioned up I have I have an influencer iPhone case I know for for lack of better term I have a uh this is this is from maximize I don't if you've seen his uh his his videos say weapon of mass distraction I'm a Believer in the van of the iPhone case um and uh I'm also the the the place where I where I I I work is uh we we do websites and that includes the road the road website who did that the viral um the case that has lipstick holder so look I would immediately take that and be looking at all right you have the IP angle is a great angle but I think the utility angle is still the best angle to take for uh for anything that's going on the internet right because people are more likely to save and share something with utility than they think is cool because we are so inundated with cool stuff and that is just my my general um take of like where we are right now on the psychist and so I'd be looking at okay what can we take within the Charizard world that like makes this useful right can we slap is it can we make like the back case big enough to put a uh a full pack of cards in or whatever that is you can like you can hold your deck or whatever that would be that would tie into what that experience looks like or what else are like the youth really really into that could make for like a funny potentially viral viral case to tell the Brand Story one um just because I'm I have a bunch of uh cologne's really popular right now and so I've been sent to all this influencer cologne that I'm never going to wear and I have like 20 of them in front of me but that's a thing right kids right now young men especially are building like their perfume bar it's like a thing that's happening online so i' be like all right cool how can I like if they want to carry that with them throughout the day like what's the iPhone case allows me to hold four of those that has the royalty with you know whatever uh you know colog somaler they're following on the internet so yeah I would basically be attaching utility to that that has virality and storytelling I think any of those could then have you have a hundred videos that Spawn from that you can repeat those videos whenever like some new exclusivity drops and then you're on your way to uh to establishing your cult so my initial reaction to that is well if you're building a luxury product which this is do you need to have utility that was my initial reaction and then you started talking about the cologn which by the way I had no idea that cologne is like a you know popular right now the The Ether are in a shocking place right now but we'll get there exactly we can unpack that later in the video so uh what you're kind of saying is you know utility doesn't need to be like your standard utility around uh just covering covering the phone but it could mean like how do you how do you put utility and marry that to what's happening in the cultural Z guys is that what you're saying exactly that's exactly what I'm saying because I think your luxury point is actually an interesting one and I spend a lot of my background is in like conversations around luxury and higher end and items that sell for a premium price point and so like the concept of luxury I think is really important for people with ideas to to understand is there's basically like luxury is inherently rooted in craft right people buy their Hermes saddle or whatever it is because of the quality level with which has been sustained over a period of time and then the the desire that comes from people you know wanting to attain the ability to acquire that quality level so luxury is inherently rooted than craft and since in iPhone case I don't know how much craft you can apply to that we've already seen the carbon fiber cases and rare python leather or whatever doesn't really change my experience but then one level down from that we have what I call designer products right where the design differentiates it you can charge a premium because the design is so cool or so interesting and a good example of that is I don't if you've seen those metal cases that are like two pieces but it's like a little metal like almost like liquid metal looking thing that goes on top and the bottom they advertise on on Instagram a lot that's a designer case right right you're charging a premium for someone's really unique design you could say the same thing about like say this more hype beasty concept where it's like oh you get your Charizard or it's a you know it's a Travis Scott case or whatever it is could fall in that category but really where luxury is at its Pinnacle is that combination of of utility and craft right where you're able to say like a a perfume experience depending on what o you have Etc can can be a a luxury experience and if you marry that with you know uh all the utility that comes from it like the craft and the story of it you're kind of reaching reaching that P so I think that's what we be we' be trying to do here and now I'm leaning into the idea of the colog case right like let's get it so it could have four or six of those testers let's launch it with like an exclusive with you know uh with with YSL or whoever is going to give us the four tester set that fits right within it we're going to go we're going to go uh Mr because you're going to get four to six sent to you on on a quarterly basis and you can sign up based on your scent profile and then you can share the scent profiles with with your friends via the via the app obviously uh which has its other like inherently so you know social value and then you can get your your pheromone ratio you know through the wearable all right we're going too far shh don't tell anyone but I've got 30 plus startup ideas that could make you millions and I'm giving them away for free these aren't just random guesses they're validated Concepts from entrepreneurs who built hundred million plus businesses I've compiled them into one simple database compiled from hundreds of conversations I've had on my podcast but the main thing is most of these ideas don't need a single investor some cost nothing to start I'm pretty much handing you a cheat sheet the idea bank is your startup shortcut just click below to get access your next cash flowing business is waiting for you well you know what's cool about this idea is when you think of of okay what's that brand it's a men's clone I almost bought it and then I looked at the price and it was like $250 for a clone there's one I think it starts with a C do you know what I'm talking about I'm not sure what's the cre or you know I have only gotten back into cologne because I have uh it was it came up so often in this I did this uh like I do these like reports for like larger like retail groups and stuff like that where it's like oh like what's trending and so I end up doing like these focus groups with Gen Z all the time and and the perfume thing came up and then I started to say I always used to say no to the influencer seating on perfume and now I take them all because yeah it's a it's a whole thing so I but I'm not like super Savvy as to what brands are popping right now I I got it I got it I was close I I called it cre but it was really Creed um and I just like the first link that came up is it it's a 12 Creed $1,260 for I don't know like it's like the the laam mer of uh of cologne let's go yeah exactly so listen if you're going to I don't care how wealthy you are if you're taking one Spritz of that Creed you're hoping that someone's like wait is that a is that a ODU you know aventus you know that's you're but that's the problem with cologne is there's no easy way to share the status of your cologne yeah well the uh and it's interesting because you do want to let's go back to marketing from utility so A A friend of mine has a Tik Tok shop that smashing it where he sells cologne and he sells a cologne called her loss named after the Drake uh and it is a pheromone cologne because he's playing on it's 130 bucks or or 95 bucks or whatever that is uh I guess we're down to 80 on Amazon and he they're playing into that idea that you know there is a chemical attraction element to what cologne can do for you and that is a a perfect scenario for the Tik Tok shop but I think it's you because people aren't going to notice what that wi is and no one's recognize the Creed scent uh I think you know if you really want to make something in that Niche and you don't have the infinite marketing budget apparently Creed has then uh you have to go back to good old fashioned chemical utility whether it works or not how how do you look at a Tik Tok shop and see how much revenue they are doing uh yeah so basically you can click into this this core store so basically you'll see the hard part about this is that all these people have like 50 accounts now but if you go to the core one that has the store on it and click over into shop the individual items will have at how many units sold on there behind them and so your buddy you know I don't know if you can say but like what ballpark is he doing in Revenue he he's pretty uh uh his his handle he's pretty open about it like but they're doing a couple 100K a month just in the cologne like he's he's on Instagram talking all about that you know full full full Guru life so yeah so I think they're they're doing really well on that well but I think look the the alpha there for the ideas podcast is that like there's a young demographic online that are discovering these experiences for the first time cologne right and there's a ton of influencer videos on Colones if you see these these guys have these like cologne collections so there's all these influencers have like 50 and then they'll pull the bottle out like really close in front of the camera like a macro shop some ornate like a good example John vvad bottles are great examples I'm like or Nate crazy bottle and they'll take the whiff and they'll be like talking about it or whatever and there's all these you know when we were exposed to Cologne whenever we were growing up like I don't know it's like whatever my dad had or like some stuff I saw on a magazine ad right and this is they're getting exposed to it through these insane people on it on on Tik Tok and then they're going hey I want to start my own Journey what does that look like but guess what if you watch a video on cologne on Instagram you're going to get shown more videos about cologne on Instagram so if you and then if it's a Tik Tok Shop video where someone's actually purchasing product recurring from it Instagram is waiting that super heavily in the cologne algorithm so basically as soon as you start down that rabbit hole you're getting hit with her loss right or with with my boy's product and and who's hijacking that consumer Journey who's saying yeah instead of finding out the other way a native Tik Tok shop brand is taking advantage of that opportunity inside culture and that is a really interesting concept to me and who else is is because I'm fascinated and I think a lot of people are fascinated with Tik Tok shop so like how do you build a business on Tik Tok shop and who's doing it well like what what uh goalie at all or no tell tell tell me about it all right so so Tik Tok shop is a scale game this is the thing that breaks most cmo's brains right now is everyone back to our com about one Tik Tok account whatever they started off the account with is that is Tik Tok is a game of Affiliates right uh so basically other people that create content for for your brand to then and they link your product and they get a percentage of that sale most of them are also on retainer so for instance I ran Tik Tok shop at at this brand I I was at um I was a CMO previously we had a toy brand we had five or six creators that were on monthly retainer 1,500 to 2500 bucks this is very typical bigger Brands will build this up to 50 creators 100 creators they are thirsting for creators to be able to do this because it's it's a lucrative system for that, 1500 2500 bucks a month they make let's say 15 to 20 videos you know sometimes more that are about that and there's software doing it too not related to shop separate combo and if those videos go well people buy a product from them on Tik Tok shop that Creator gets a percentage that goes in their bank account that's why you see all these kids now there's a lot of kids aged 20 to 25 who are in these discords like the collective and stuff like that or I think they just changed their name it's called your first dollar where they are making 10 15 grand a month 25 Grand a month off these commissions flaunting that on the internet because of course that's what we do now but like actually making good money uh and like that is a really interesting opportunity because they're doing it off of like affiliate sales but the thing is there's no limit to the scale of that currently because Tik Tok is so wide and we all look at creators differently right um I I when I was first making content I was at like 100k I noticed someone was jacking my content someone was copying my videos word for word and they had like 40,000 followers I was like oh man but they I went looked at the account they look different to me different race General different overall Vibe completely different follower base almost no overlap to my follower base and that's like the important concept to understand is that everyone's Tik Tok algorithm is different they want to see different people they have different interests they have different niece and then the Tam of that is like ludicrously wide so if you look at a Tik Tok shop brand you go if I'm goalie like a gummy brand okay every single person in the on the earth is my Tam for this right and I also sell this on Amazon so I'm gonna have young creators of every uh gender race overall Vibe content type I'm gonna have middle-aged creators older creators I want to cover as many as I can as long as I can make the math work from an affiliate perspective that they get 20% of the sale I get the other money off Tik Tok shop I have a certain Splash over into Amazon and now Tik Tok and Amazon are becoming one for that fulfillment like that is the size of the opportunity and you'll see why why I bring up goalie from the start is their incentive package for Affiliates going into Q4 is insane what I mean by incentive package it's basically if you generate enough gmv like the market value of sales there it's like Rolex Lamborghini a condo in Miami night at Amiri like that's the level which we're talking about like for these kids and that's the promoted program they have and that's how far these big Tik Tok shop brands are from where these like Legacy Brands who can't move on there are as like and the Arbitrage is crazy dude I actually I actually love you I I I I we have to unpack all of that because I feel like there's to you that's completely uh of course this is happening you know in my world though I'm like in the software world so I don't like think about these things you mentioned something at Discord I think you called it uh yeah it's called your first dollar used to be called the collective but that's like where all the kids go and get trained and then Brands go and like recruit in there explain explain exactly what it is yeah so if I'm so like if I was if I was 19 right now I worked at Chick-fil-A when I was 19 and I worked at abomi I got fir from Abie I worked at chickfila long story that sucked right so if but say say I'm online I'm like these kids are making money on Tik Tok shop how do I do it so there's a Discord Channel where they teach kids how to make videos basically like how to use capcut Tik Tok editor what's a good hook what's a good whatever and so kids will go on they'll pay I think it's like 15 bucks a week or something like light to go say all right cool do I want to do this but I want to learn how to make videos and then Brands will post opportunities like hey this Brands want 20 videos for Tik Tok shop so I recruited off of that when I worked at this toy company I was like cool I need a Creator in the UK because Regional is big in Tik Tok too I need a Creator in Germany I need a Creator who does Spanish we recruited off there pay these kids x amount for the videos they get x amount of the Tik Tok shop Revenue they've already been trained you can see some of the content they're doing or they're brand new and you're giving them a shot for a lesser rate and then Brands will come in there kind of with deals and recruiting at the same size so they kind of have a two-tiered system but like that's what kids want to do that they have to go figure out how to do that somewhere so either you take a course but a course is like the wrong framework for anything now right it's like course and Community much rather you'd have the Discord where people like me are hopping in there like give me a couple youth to go make videos about whatever I have a budget and so all that kind of happens in one place and that's one of like 10 discords where this is happening insane insane that that exists because you know I did a tweet the other day about you know if you were going to create the YC of today in a world where software is commoditized it's all about distribution what is the YC for creators look like and if I feel like it's kind of this right yeah well also I look at I mean honest so my last before I hopped on this podcast I was giving a talk to YC about content for software and so um so a quick note on that is the same things in software right so if you look at um airbuds you look at I think the other one like is is Humane um Humane is like the mental health one there's Jenny there's GG dating uh GG D is a good one there's trip BFF this software that said hey content Market fit is as important as product Market fit but they're using 50 creators like I think airbuds definitely has has 50 you know GG has four or five accounts maybe two or three creators even like like ladder has like 30 trainers on their fitness app that are creators so they're applying the same Theory they just don't have the unit economics that Tik Tok shop does Tik Tok shop is great because there's a get-rich dynamic that is that is material that you can literally calculate out the way you calculate like meta ads Rass and and like be in the mix of that's amazing software you have to like look at it's much more it's a little more intangible but that that's literally happening but also you look at like to your point about the Creator YC like I run this program called cut 30 we have 100 150 people in it every every time we do it it's like every six weeks to teach people how to be content creators and the hit rate is crazy like the group chat of the people we have a group chat of people that like really pop off going from there and it's like 16 18 people who've become like hundreds of thousands of followers right and like we're not the only one there's other people that are doing that but like all this is happening in these closet communities the only people that know about that I don't like go run a million ads about that or talk about it every day it's just people that like have gone down funnel enough to even get promoted to same thing with the collective they're not splashing that on the front page like a bunch of us aren't tweeting about it but it happens in the background and that's where I feel like entrepreneurs and CMOS get left out is because if you can't find a way to be visible into the world that's happening around you and into the trends that are around you you're literally just getting left behind just to finish up on the Tik Tok thing what else to people need to know about building on Tik Tok starting a business on Tik Tok uh it's an operational nightmare um the hardest part about that is dealing with Tik Tok and your inventory being in there and not so like I mentioned I was at a toy brand uh with this beforehand we we were getting we got shut down on Tik Tok shop so much that we basically stopped um we had a product that was on the edge of compliance there's a reason for that but basically there's just so many Logistics around shipping and customer service and compliance and violations and Strikes that's like all automated by Tik Tok that you have to be you need to have a uniquely insane and process-driven operational person who is dedicated to that to work through the scale but if you are is likely worth that on the other end especially if you are have a good Amazon business because the crossover is huge and if you're walking into a retail conversation something I like to call out is I worked with this water brand called chlorofil water where he was really early on Tik Tok the founder seated out a ton of product on Tik Tok when he launched we had this whole SEO strategy we put together but he had there was something like a billion views on the chlorop water hashtag when he lost launched and he walked that right into retail and was like look at the demand for my product and it is but this is not a product that is consumed online people don't buy cases of water or single water it's a prod that's consumed in retail and like guess how those retail conversations went right of course they want to take advantage of what that that of that Arbitrage right of we want to be the person that has that availability that's still the conversation like we talk about Tik Tok shop there's the crossover to Amazon and the crossover to Natural retail because of how much Discovery entertainment happens on that platform today damn dude like that that I I do feel it and maybe other people listening the whole like supply chain just feels like a black box like I don't even know where to start on terms of like making a product yeah in terms of making a product so I would go to like if you know kind of if you have a general idea but uh you want to go into the belly of the Beast and I would go to Canton Fair it's twice a year it's in China I know that sounds like something that would be a wild thing to do but it is they literally like it's like the mecca for where things are created um and that includes everything food you know like you know jewelry Electronics like whatever it is food may say slightly less but let's say if you wanted to get into the supplements game there's that there's a network of other more specific like you want to do gummies you want to do stuff made in the US whatever there's there's a bunch of like trade shows related to that but like Canton fair is where everything in the world is made like all the factories that make everything in the world go to to display their Wares and the Western world is kind of come and adopted and there's enough understanding that you have to deal with people that speak English when you're there and that's where people go to find their factories experience supply chain for the first time obviously if you don't want to go all the way over to China if you do go there you're going to get the best rates you're going to actually see people's operations you're going to see all the available options if you don't do that like I don't know the reason there's a reason that Alibaba Founders are so rich right like between Alibaba and Petra you basically have access to factories of any kind to make anything you want basically anywhere in the world like or you can hunt them down individually I I just feel like to me like the product creation part is fully Antiquated right now it's actually so easy to use Alibaba or go talk now through WeChat or with translation or the amount of Chinese people that speak English or to anywhere in the world to make something that really comes down to more of like distribution of ideas being more important than the creation of them what sort of software tools do you use to come up with ideas figure out supply chain competitive analysis like what's your uh content creation what is what are the things that people probably need to look into um there there's there's a whole there's a whole bunch of them um but I would say like yeah so like e-commerce like particles interesting on e-commerce because you Bally look at any Brands like Shopify data over time um and store data over time and so that's a good one to be like how much should people do promotions what colors do they sell the most of how much do they really sell of x x units or Y then there's the more traditional um ones like Amazon ones like like aium 10 and things like that there is a really specific one for Tik Tok shop that my brain is uh is short circuiting on right right now but I'll find that one before the end of it but like I manage my entire life in notion in these like databases where basically every project has like the supply chain is all is all tracked in there notion is great because it's also functional in in China um um so people can update their statuses and stuff and all like that but basically every project is tracked in terms of like where things are in production and Target dates content Rob app is populated by where product road map ends on like on a separate uh a separate dock um but it is interesting the creative workflow is the one that's most interesting to talk about because we have CRM we have Erp but creative teams like there's so many briefs and so much content being created Now by these teams and there's really no good way to track it everyone's using like these Ultra complex like notion slack Combos and there's not like a dedicated creative plat for that and it's moving so fast that by the time anyone creates it it's probably going to be iterated away but anyway software opportunity for people all right so yes this is the Tik to app the name eludes me at the moment just my brain is short circuiting but basically it shows you creators and how much market value they're doing so how much sales they're actually making and then that's the and then basically also you can go explore products and categories in a similar way which allows you to then format formulate a strategy to go DM creators do Outreach and like that's the gate that everyone has right is finding more people actually getting them to want to do something with your product and like getting that relationship and following up is definitely the hardest part of that right now quick ad break let me tell you about a business I invested in it's called boring marketing.com so a few years ago I met this group of people that were some of the best SEO experts in the world they were behind getting some of the biggest companies found on Google and the secret sauce is they've got a set of technology and AI that could help you outrank your competition so for my own business businesses I wanted that I didn't want to have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I didn't want to depend on ads to drive customers to my businesses I wanted to rank high in Google that's why I like SEO and that's why I use boring marketing.com and that's why I invested in it they're so confident in their approach that they offer a 30-day Sprint with 100% money back guarantee who does that nowadays so check it out highly recommend boring marketing.com and so we've talked a lot about Tik Tok but YouTube do you do any sort of competitive analysis on YouTube or you just don't really touch it no I mean I still don't think as a platform I'm excited about the features they're putting in for products like I've tagged a bunch of my own products inside my YouTube channel things like that haven't seen like big sales lift or anything I do not think of that as a platform for Brands besides very mainstream cpg Brands like that like that compai Foods um like like candy brand is a perfect brand for for YouTube YouTube shorts but I think um YouTube when I talk about the algorithms like Tik Tok is extremely good at giving you very specific things it can Zone in on like like when I was in China it was showing me content of other Americans like in China like like the level of which that they they are good at being able to do is is actually shocking even though it's like on a VPN and but then with YouTube It's So mainstream if the content that succeeds has to be like painfully mainstream on shorts at least so if you are a niche product you have less of a chance of reaching your audience there but you have a product with wide appeal and you have a viral format you have a lot of opportunity for success but I still don't think of that as a YouTube YouTube as a primary sales driver for most businesses wow that's a hot take dude I appreciate that yeah that's a really hot take I mean like first of all the interesting thing is you don't even you don't even mention long form yeah well long form is a brand builder for Brands to be able to put out there and obviously there's influencers that put a bunch of that like inside their their content to build it but when you look at a like a tactical useful strategy with Arbitrage that you can then compare to you can come at from a numbers perspective the way you come at advertising I look at short form like and especially what's happening on Tik Tok like way more specifically quantifiable actionable scalable organically than than YouTube is is more of a like a slower more marauding more brand focused game not that that's a bad thing for for Brands but I think uh the opportunity with Organic virality on short form is is generational and before we before we leave I have to ask you because you're the goat at this besides format if you're trying to create a Tik Tok audience you're trying to create cont content that's to land with people how do you do it uh so this is a good one there's a couple things uh like so core macro level you there's three types of content right content that drives value and not just like I have three tips like value that someone wants to bookmark or share like my content works so well because I get shared in slack channels of companies small and large every day thousands of times because I I make content specifically for that I want my content to get I want some I want your director to drop it in the slack Channel and be like why aren't we doing this or I want a a creative person to be like sending it to their creative team I want to do this so value that is savable and sharable either either does that or it entertains it replaces Netflix in the TV experience or it fails those are your three options for for content right and what happens is so many people fall in that third bucket because they go say I'm going to talk about my brand story or I'm gonna talk about what my product does that's cool and no one cares and even if you're an established brand why a lot of their content isn't good is that they don't care but if you take that same lens I'm G to talk about that and I'm going to provide savable sharable value or I'm going to entertain in such a way that people are consuming it in in replacement of entertainment that's where you can succeed on short form so if you're an expert you're trying to build your following or do the kind of thing I've done on there I'd be laser focused on telling stories about things because people don't care just about facts they care about facts in context of stories that are that are also playbooks that enable people to act if you are an expert in any field from Fitness to to to branding to e-commerce um to you know whatever your cardiologist like that is the format for which you to succeed beautiful I appreciate it my man where could people get to know the internet internet's creative director more yeah I'm at or meworld o Ren meworld uh on Instagram Tik Tok YouTube uh YouTube is my favorite personal platform at the moment may not drive the vand value so you can come check out the long the long form on there I have a newsletter called hyper um that is in my link bios on all there where we talk specifically about brand strategy and creative direction that is a is a worthwhile read so appreciate you having me anytime my man come back soon baby [Music]

Title: How to build a million dollar sales funnel using Facebook Ads
Published: 2024-09-16 14:15:06 UTC
Description:
I’m joined by Jonathan Courtney, as we deep dive on how to set up million dollar sales funnels. 

1) Startup Idea 1: Paid Ads Agency
• Huge market for one-person ad consulting businesses
• Target specific verticals (e.g., hair salons, female info product owners)
• Take a cut of revenue instead of charging upfront

2) Facebook ads still crush it (for 40+ demo):
• Still effective for 40+ demographics
• AJ&Smart spends $80k/month on FB ads
• 318% ROI in June ($252k revenue from $80k spend)
"Meta ads are only dead for people under 35" - Jonathan

3) Funnel basics:
• Opt-in page → Free training video → Call booking
• Use ClickFunnels for quick tests
• Use Framer for validated funnels
Pro tip: Automate everything possible in your funnel

4)  The book funnel strategy:
• Offer free digital + physical book
• Lose money upfront to get email addresses
• Monetize later with other offers
Example: http://workshopperplaybook.com/

5) Copywriting hacks:
• Focus on increasing status (even for B2B)
• Use pain vs. pleasure framework
• Adjust tone based on economic conditions
Key insight: Status increase drives purchases, even in corporate training

6) Jonathan's funnel philosophy:
• Don't obsess over tracking every conversion source
• Focus on overall company growth
• Prioritize Facebook ad spend ROI
"You have your monthly P&L. You just make sure your company is growing" - Jonathan

what is the promise that you're going to give our our listeners today by listening to this um I actually I know I told you I didn't have any ideas but I thought of some things beforehand that I think could be interesting I think there's a massive empty space in the market for not douchy non agency companies who help other people run Facebook ads literally that a lot of the times when people are building startups or when people are thinking of businesses they're not thinking about the fact that even very simple Google ads are hard to set up for a company and for even an event so just being giving people like the basic package of meta ads and Google simple Google search ads it it can be a game changer for these people here's here's what I do okay uh just to just to get the business off the ground in one month start [Music] okay what is that oh [ __ ] this is this is called the play date it is a games console made by a company called panic and it's a a collaboration between Panic let's see if I can get this wait so I'm pouring some beer here using this crank oh ah I used to be a Barman wait let's try this yes see that you see that [ __ ] so it's a collaboration between uh panic and what do you call them teenage engineering the company that I have like every product of and it's just such a cute cool thing for panic to do it took them a very long time to make it it's like a passion project but it sells like a lot I don't know if you know about panic but they do like they make this console they also publish a lot of different video games they're like an aspirational company to me I love companies that are just like doing lots of weird stuff that's what I want you love weird you love weird stuff I just had uh Jason freed on the Pod actually your boy Jason was on the Pod yeah cool very cool and we talked about making software weird so you guys are very aligned on that aligned yeah yes Jason is great we actually just moved from using slack aana a notion back to using base camp after a four-year break and it is honestly refreshing like I started to have the feeling that my company was becoming like a chat room basically um like we were just on slack all day you just open Slack and you have all these red dots and I what I presented to my team last Monday two weeks ago was let's not become a company that talks about doing stuff all the time and talks about making stuff all the time and let's just become go back to being a company that makes stuff um and so yeah I'm I I feel like base Camp's interface is more built for just working on projects instead of talking about working on projects in fact it's actually quite hard to just have open dialogues within base camp the product and this is annoying some of my team but I love it not only did you switch to base camp you went viral on Twitter for it this tweet went crazy I never have anybody liking any of my stuff on Twitter or on X I was so I hate when that happens because I'm like oh did I do something bad did I like did I post something that's somehow uh risky politically or something and no I was I opened up Twitter and there was I opened up X there was a thousand notifications I never get more than two and so I was thinking [ __ ] did I make a really off-color joke uh it was just a the post about base camp which I'm trying to pull up the post you basically were just like I switched to base camp I think I I think the way I put it I mentioned this thing about slack kind of became the default interface of my company um and that but like your tools in a way do determine a little bit what your work culture is like and it your tools kind of I don't know how you say it there's probably a really nice way to say it like the tools determine the way you work something about that um and it was just so I I've been traveling a lot over the last few weeks uh Laura and I who run the company have been rethinking the business from the ground up uh but mainly from like the outside perspective so we're going to be relaunching the business on the second of October but then we started to realize to make all of these changes we're going to have to change everything inside the business too for everything to really work and feel different so we're moving office that's one big thing moving to a new physical location a bigger space and the SEC and that's like doubling down on us working in person together being able to collaborate with more people and the second thing was getting [ __ ] rid of slack [ __ ] that [ __ ] I actually took I saw your Tweet when it had like three likes like early and I was like this is this is interesting I I shared in my slack and I was like what do you guys think of this and people people didn't want to get rid of slack of course because it becomes it is your work interface yeah it literally becomes your work interface and here's one of the dangers I think of slack I see Laura who's a senior member of AJ and smart who's running like very large seven fig sections of the business I see that I started to see that her job was replying to people on slack and I'm like wouldn't we make way more money if you used your marketing strategy skills instead of replying to [ __ ] slack messages but it makes and it's the same for me I'm the CEO and I was spending all day just replying to slack messages it's because it's like easy to do that because the work is just put there for you it's like your tasks are ready for the day whereas real work that makes real money and makes seven figure differences that doesn't come from just responding to [ __ ] on slack from my perspective so I just wanted to get rid of it Go cold turkey it's gone now I haven't opened slack in two weeks it feels liberating this is the episode like what do you want to talk about today what do you want to talk about on the startup ideas podcast so yeah what is the promise that you're going to give our our listeners today by listening to this um I actually I know I told you I didn't have any ideas but I thought of some things beforehand that I think could be interesting uh like a couple of things that I notice are missing in the industry that could be for small startups or oneperson kind of solopreneur thingies uh one is I noticed that one like one of the best ways to build business and to grow a business is to run paid ads I mean a lot of people know this the problem is wow shocker shocker wow you know everyone's been asking for Jay ice cream jce cream Jonathan Courtney for these hot takes everyone these hot takes for me um but when so a lot of businesses small businesses big businesses need uh paid ads or they often don't even realize that paid ads are worth using the problem is that the market for people who offer paid ad services are either agencies which are too expensive and like too big and just confusing or douchy guys who are like 25 wearing a gold Rolex and look kind of intimidating quick ad break let me tell you about a business I invested in it's called boring marketing.com so a few years ago I met this group of people that were some of the best SEO experts in the world they were behind getting some of the biggest companies found on Google and the secret sauce is they've got a set of technology and AI that could help you outrank your competition so for my own businesses I wanted that I didn't want to have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I didn't want to depend on ads to drive customers to my businesses I wanted to rank high in Google that's why I like SEO and that's why I use boring marketing.com and that's why I invested in it they're so confident in their approach that they offer a 30-day spread with 100% money back guarantee who does that nowadays so check it out highly recommend boring marketing.com and I think that so when I tell people that we at AJ and smart run a million dollars of ads per year they're like but Facebook ads don't work like but I heard meta ads don't work but I heard this doesn't work blah and I was I'm always very confused about why they think this but when I talk to them it's because they're somehow when they're looking for paid advertis iing for their business they fall into like the doucha verse you know what I mean they they they end up having calls with these people who are obviously just don't give you a sense of safety and trust and I'm always helping companies running their ads obviously for free this is just something I want I'm like you need to do this this is something that's very effective you can like turn on ads and get leads and then you can turn monetize those leads that's like a really big way our business runs and I think there's many there's a huge amount of space in the industry for one person ad ad Consultants basically who appeal to specific verticals and are not douchy so for example there's a huge space in the market for people who can run ads for just like salons like hair salons there's a huge space in the market for people who can run ads specifically for female product owners there's so many different verticals that you could go into running ads for people but not becoming an agency and not presenting yourself as like a rich person on uh on the internet because I I think that's a turnoff for a lot of people especially in Europe um and so that's one thing I'm thinking I'm always thinking about like again which which businesses would I start or which businesses am I trying to get my friends to start so that I can eventually just become part of it and and get a cut of it um I think there's a massive empty space in the market for not douchy non agency companies or single person shows who help other people run Facebook ads literally that that's it that's one idea what do you think do you notice this with the the fact that like paid ads get poo pooed but probably not for the right reasons yeah I also noticed that the gold Rolex Presidential or whatever it's called they all have the gold Rolex I don't know what it is about signing up to a meta account but it's like you need it's like you need unlock it with the Rox yeah it's like instead of log in with Facebook it's like log in with your gold Rolex yes yes I mean that's fine if you're appealing to people who want to run ads for that kind of Lifestyle stuff but it turns a there's a lot of people not realizing that there's an entire rest of the market for like if if you were um I I see I see a lot of open space for people to run ads to grow people's patreon accounts their creative patreon accounts things like this where it's about taking a cut of the of the revenue or something like that but there's just so much open space for it I'm I'm experimenting with this in my business at the moment so we're I'm experimenting with partnering up with other uh people in my kind of strategy design space and helping them run ads and helping them with sort of lead generation um and sometimes I'm shocked I'm like why haven't you done this in the last six years like why why are you just doing it now and often the story is a little bit like oh yeah we tried it and it didn't work and then we talked to this guy and he seemed a bit scammy and then this and this and this then we worked with this agency and we couldn't contact them and I'm like there's so much space for this there's so much space in the market for this just being the honestly just being a meta ads expert would be a game changer if you if you don't Market yourself in a weird uh it's about getting rich way you know what I mean so are you running the as The Meta ads expert are you running the ads yourself or you're just coaching them on how to run ads quite literally sit in a room with them uh opening The Meta dashboard showing them our meta dashboard showing them how we're doing it so it's a more of an advisory thing um so we're like advisor advising people on setting up funnels and taking a cut of their revenue we're going to like announce that publicly in probably two weeks after we launched this episode um but yeah it's for the last like two and a half years we've been advising other companies on lead generation building funnels that kind of stuff pure advisory no agency work no Consulting I guess it is a bit of Consulting but like yeah I was just like I don't know the difference between advisory and Consulting exactly so this idea what I okay now what I'm really understanding is someone can go and do this and not even charge a monthly fee but say like hey I'll take a percentage of Revenue here's here's what I do okay uh just to just to get the business off the ground in one month the first thing I would do is look around at events like yo let's say yoga retreats that are happening around New York something like that um just make a Google doc of the ones that are not full yet they haven't been filled and I would contact these people and try to figure out hey are you having trouble filling up these events I can fill it up for you using Facebook ads but I'm going to take a cut of every ticket sale the end there that's all my first clients obviously not everyone would say yes but that would be an example of how I would jump on this starting this business but yeah I would be looking for things where I think the product is probably good or the product is maybe interesting to me so I know how to make ads for it who uh and for me that's like creative stuff so I I I could definitely sell I could definitely help someone make ads for like creative Retreats things like this yoga retreats meditation anything in the wellness space anything in the design space um I'd also look at things like bigger you know know install like art installation things things like this I would be reaching out to these people assuming they don't know how to do paid ads and trying to work with them on selling out their thing because honestly event owners hate selling events they love putting on events that would be like my first vertical that I would attack well it's a pretty broad vertical so it's like a horizontal vertical of events but I would be looking at events around a city that I kind of understand in general topics that I kind of understand and I would offer them a deal like that where I'm taking a cut only for the ones they sell and only for the ones they sell through my ads through their ads which I help them set up cool I like it I mean easy to start I feel like you're right like people are getting I think you're right this you're you're right I don't like to say you're right often and the other thing is people think meta ads are dead because people are not understanding that meta ads are only dead for people under 35 So Meta ads work really really well for us better than anything else for over people over 40 and there are a lot of people over 40 in the world they're not all just dead you know so I think that a lot of the times when people are building startups or when people are thinking of businesses they're not thinking about the fact that just because they don't see Meta ads and just because they're not on Instagram does it mean like a massive amount of the population aren't seeing these things even very simple Google ads are hard to set up for a company and for even an event so just being giving people like the basic package of meta ads and Google simple Google search ads it's it can be a game changer for these people and if you're taking a small cut of every single one of those sales I know someone else who doing this as well and he's doing pretty well and he's also not douchy and he's a bit more like bit more in the selling like the spiritual events and stuff like that like Retreats things like this I don't know I feel my brain is a bit muggy I don't know if I'm making am I making sense you need your brain needs to get muggy more often because you are finally making some this is sweaty I'm also sweat okay so I was talking to a friend of mine the other day and I was like how's business he runs a SAS SAS business I think they do like three or four million AR software as a slug wasn't it software as a slug exactly yeah I just wanted to make sure that I know what you're talking about yeah and I'm like how are things going and he's like oh you know amazing like things are things are you know we just hit three and a half million ARR and we're growing double digits month over month and it's like oh great and then he ends it with and we don't even run any paid ads as like as as if it's something to be proud of or as if it's something to be proud of and I I hear that often I don't know if you hear this often ESP I hear all the time dude you're constantly hearing it I hear it all the [ __ ] time and I'm like yeah that's because you're stupid that you could have six million AR yeah exactly um I don't want to say your friend is stupid obviously I mean he isn't he's he isn't he's a really smart guy um but I think for whatever reason in Ventureland um a lot of the time it's it's kind of it's one of those things it's it's kind of a a status symbol to be like you don't 100% a status symbol this is the problem we take a lot of the Silicon Valley status symbols and try to apply these status symbols to small businesses I think this is what Jason freed is good at kind of cutting out and getting through the [ __ ] a lot of these status symbols like not running ads saying Facebook is dead saying meta dead are totally relevant when you're trying to be when the status game in Silicon Valley and the status game in startups is to work on like The Cutting Edge stuff but if you're working on doing something that's like you know running a yoga retreat or uh running a creaters retreat or trying to sell cups or whatever it is you don't need to play those types of status games and in fact they might actually hurt you like trying to build a massive personal brand or a massive like crazy like trying to do what liquid death did uh but for your tiny Yoga Retreat or something isn't going to necessarily apply without having loads of funding and all these other things um I think ads are just such an amazing easy way to start for most people I also know it because I run a community which has like a couple of thousand people in it we teach people also hey you know we're teaching them facilitation but we realize after a while well they need to get clients so we need to teach them some Basics and when people run ads into a simple funnel they get call bookings and when they get call bookings they get clients the end it's as simple as that when you're a oneperson show or a small team ads are so so helpful when you can't do some massive branding campaign and get on TV and do Billboards and stuff I don't think you should start with ads though that's my take because I think in order to create ads that are really high highly performing you have to have your messaging pretty dialed and I think the best way to get your messaging really dialed is to do organic content yes see what works on places like Twitter Instagram just do that for free learn that's your training wheels and then once once it starts to get get traction then you know okay this is the messaging on social I need and this is the messaging I need on my landing page that actually converts now I'm ready to experiment with paid ads I agree for Mo in most cases I agree with you uh and what we do is we because our audience again is is older like our our at the event that your uh CEO was at I think he was probably the youngest person there and he's in his 30s or something yeah so our audience our audience he's in his 70s he's in his 70s exactly he's in his late 70s like just due to the price range like our uh in-person events cost like 11,000 something dollars we are aiming for like generally it's senior people at corporates and and Consultants coming to our events oh now the senior people makes sense to me I don't they're quite literally senior people I don't mean senior senior uh although actually yeah the range the range of Ages at our last event was from 20 25 to 706 not too bad huh not too bad not too bad um what was I trying to say [ __ ] was I trying to say you're you're losing your memory in your old age dude I've had such a crazy last like six weeks my brain is done I need a break I can't get a break until like the 3rd of August but I'm definitely at the point now where I'm I'm like I actually need a break shh don't tell anyone but I've got 30 plus startup ideas that could make you millions and I'm giving them away for free these aren't just random guesses they're validated Concepts from entrepreneurs who built hundred million plus businesses I've compiled them into one simple database compiled from hundreds of conversations I've had on my podcast but the main thing is most of these ideas don't need a single investor some cost nothing to start I'm pretty much handing you a cheat sheet the idea bank is your startup shortcut just click below to get access your next cash flowing business is waiting for you but I but I think I was talking about ads [ __ ] ads all right [ __ ] it this is what happens when a guy from Europe comes to America for an extended period of time and goes to like LA and San Francisco and just gets overwhelmed the Mind cannot comprehend there was an earthquake while I was in La by the way oh are you okay I I I was making deals while this was happening I just ignored it to be honest I actually just didn't so I was on a call I was walking on the beach I didn't feel it but if I had felt it I would have totally freaked out I would have like cried or something we had like a a WhatsApp group for all the people who came to our event and they were like Point uh posting about it um but yeah so like let me close this this one up it is I I remember what I was talking about um it it is like this kind of form of Pride it's a status symbol to not run ads fine if you want to be if you're already like if you've already got funding if you've already got some Angel investment um or if you're just like have a huge personal brand oh yeah no dude I remember you were saying first post on you know first post post on social media before ads and I agree with this the only thing is sometimes people I agree that this is the best way to do it in the beste scenario you're able to test things out in an organic environment and seeing what and even just getting a feel for the way you write and practicing so we tell people and our people to to practice on LinkedIn just because that's where they happen to hang out um running ads though I think in itself is worth learning just as a discipline just because when you get that thing you want to sell you don't want to be feeling helpless and just like oh there's there's nothing I can do now I just have to wait and beg people to buy my thing or come to my thing I love the idea of just being able to put money into the machine the machine finds the people for you and then you can figure out how you're going to convert them which is another whole thing but I do think you're right if you can do both it's even better but I just think that discipline or knowing someone who can do it knowing someone who who can help you run these things and like demystify it uh is great and becoming the type of person who can help other people do that not huge startups but small businesses I think it's an no-brainer you know I've known you for a few years now and you talk I you always talk about ads I always it takes like if I'm hanging out with you takes like two minutes before you just bring up ads you just love bringing it up but I haven't heard you talk at all about conversion really like how much do you think about landing page conversion conversion rate optimization we well we definitely always we think about it more like return on ads ad spent essentially so our row ass and we are aiming we're basically aiming for like okay we spent $1 we want to make $150 back right and we have our funnel laid out essentially in every step so we'll have a funnel we'll have like 12 steps 12 different things that are going on and we're constantly constantly tweaking it so that like our Workshop or Master funnel which was which is our kind of most successful program we have been tweaking and like poking looking at this funnel to increase conversions for four years now since since November 2020 but it's not just landing page conversion rate it's sales calls it's like tweaking the video on the second page it's like the survey we're constantly tweaking it so the answer to the question is we obsess about it but we don't obsess about it in the very beginning we get the funnel out there and then we can really quickly see which things are broken which things make no sense um but yeah a funnel from day one to day 100 usually looks pretty different or a landing page can you walk me through how you actually write out the funnel and how you build the funnel and what tools you use i' I'd love to do that if it's not too boring I mean it is probably boring but it's whoever's going to listen to it is is gonna is going to probably do quite well so I think it's and and I'm I want to know okay yeah I think when you're learning a new thing when I'm learning a new thing the best way for me to learn it is to have one very specific example thing that I can use as my like I'm going to it's like I don't know if you're looking at a I'm trying to think of a good analogy for this maybe I don't need an analogy when I got into funnels the best way for me to learn funnels was finding someone else's funnel I really liked and funnel hacking it essentially signing up to every single part of it screenshotting every single page looking at all the emails screenshotting all those printing out the entire thing laying it all out and trying to understand what the hell is going on here like why is this happening and then this happening and then this happening so for me one of the first types of funnels that I got really interested in was called a vssl funnel which is a video salesletter funnel and it has um I'll just draw the thing I'm going to draw like the basics of this funnel so this funnel for us we are getting so this is cheesy but we're we go to this uh very cheesy but fun event called funnel hacking live which I've told people about before and this year I hope I'm not over I hope it actually happens or else this will be kind of embarrassing but we're picking up an award for having our first 10 million funnel and so I'll draw out our $10 million funnel so it's one one draw it out while you're drawing it out people who are listening to this on audio you might want to head to YouTube oh yeah I'll try to describe it but I'll draw the main funnel so we have an the first page you create is called an opin page so this is basically a page that offers someone who interested in the topic something and for in a vsl funnel that's something is a free training video so if let's say you want for us we want to sell a $7,500 facilitation program which is like a combination of uh self-paced videos and actual live coaching so we want to sell that and so what we offer them we don't sell them that first we don't even tell them about that first our Facebook ad is selling a onehour free training which teaches you the basics of facilitation and so our opin page is to sell that free training nothing else and so our opt-in page leads to a video okay when you say free train selling a free training you're not selling so the way you talk about it in marketing is you're always selling the thing that sells the thing I wish I could remember the name of the guy who said that Steve Larsson I think so your your Facebook ad is selling the opt-in page your opt-in page is selling watching the video your and I'll I'll tell you as you go but your basic right now all you're focused on is selling the idea of watching this video because people can get free stuff online all the time all of the all of YouTube is free why the hell should you give your email address and sit down and watch this particular video so you do have to sell watching this video basically um because in in the end someone being trained by you on a small level is an ad it's a pitch essentially because they're getting a sense of what it's like to be trained by you so there's an opt-in page which which basically tells them that they can get this free it can be also a downloadable it can be a lead magnet it can be like a PDF we're doing a new one soon which is like a list of different exercises and that kind of stuff like we have this this is actually one version of it here I'm holding it up to the screen it's an book a physical book called meetings that we're going to be using as a lead magnet that will actually ship to you it doesn't matter the page is about getting your email address and ideally getting your attention on something and so the next page so the first page we build these on either framer or clickfunnels so framer is when we want to have something that looks nice and clickfunnels is when a random person at AJ and smart including me who doesn't want to figure out how to use framer properly just needs to test some Facebook ads so I don't have any affiliate with click funnel click funnels uh but that's like what we use for a lot of our funnels so I'll make an opin page and how do I figure out how that op opend page should look I look at other people's opt-in pages right that's how I do it then the next page is the video the video is like a a training based off the book which is called expert secrets from Russell Brunson I know people think he's cheesy I don't care I think that book is really good and I use the I use 50% of the format of that book to do the training and instead of selling something at the end of the training like he does because I don't feel comfortable doing this I sell a call so basically I tell the in in this training I tell people if you liked this training and you want to know if you want to get like a proper training from AJ and smart either in person or online you can book a call with one of our career coaches who will talk you through and show you all the different things we have and we get between 16 and 20 of these call bookings per day which we which we have gotten since November 2020 um so the video leads to a call booking wait it sorry go ahead are you charging for these calls or they're free they're free they're free we we are actually paying for everything up until this point it's actually Roi negative up until this point um so it's a Facebook ad to an opt-in page to a free training and then this free training a certain amount of people I can tell you the exact stats we have if you're interested because I have this I want your I want the exact stats I am highly interested I'll open up the funnel tracking sheet and I'll tell you everything open up the funnel tracking sheet all right let's see will I give you a will I give you a feeling for this one funnel about how much how much it cost how much it made kind of thing so we spent uh 74 it's Euro we spent $80,000 on ads um in what month is this in June so this is just the June page that's open right now $80,000 in June on Facebook ads uh $6,000 in June on Google and YouTube ads so total ads oh yeah sorry total ads spent so total ads spend between Facebook and Google $79,000 $86,000 then total cash collected was 207 uh 2 oh yeah total revenue was $252,000 so and that's like 2,00 270,000 yeah $270,000 $252,000 this is getting confused using I apologize but our return on investment on Facebook ads and Google ads was 38% so that's an example um and you can see how many calls booked we had 339 call bookings only 273 of those people turned up because obviously not everyone turns up and we sold 65 units of Workshop or master that's an example of this particular funnel running um and this has been going for you know four and a half uh well whatever since November 2020 is so yeah that's that funnel so it's four years by the way four years okay Facebook and Google ads uh which then lead to a an opt-in page which then leads to a video which then leads to a uh calendly which then leads to the team taking call bookings if you want to see this funnel working you can but please don't book if I will ask your audience to not book calls that I'm just wondering should I do this to my team because actually every time they click on the ad we're going to get charged no I'm actually if you know you know if you know how to do this you know how to do it but I'm not it will please don't do the call booking part of this because that will cost my team a lot of time and money if you cancel but yeah we have multiple funnels like this we also have a book funnel that's running um one I can actually show you or your team can look at if you search for the work Shopper Playbook um and you go to Workshop or playbook.com this is the same thing except inste except instead of a free training you can get a either a free Kindle version of the book or you can get a digital and physical copy of the book we get we make zero actually we lose money at this step um but we want you to give us your email address and your details because then we can bring you into other parts of the funnel and we'll often use this as like the front end of the funnel because Facebook ads when you're holding something physical like a book work really well and so this is one of our funnels that has been probably the most successful one we've ever made and this book obviously isn't the best book ever it was supposed to just be a little PDF lead magnet that I created in the space of one week or less um but in the end it was like oh this lead magnet's getting so big we can use it as a bookfunnel but yeah so ads to bookfunnel to getting the email address and then into some sort of campaign later like our Black Friday campaign for this year so we'll take those leads which have not been monetized yet and we'll bring them into our Black Friday campaign uh we'll figure out what we want to sell or what we want to do um but yeah that's and all of that is Facebook ads basically and when you Black Friday campaign that's kind of like a squeeze campaign as they call it we for us this is straight up hardcore email marketing like we start telling people on anybody who's come through any of our funnels but hasn't bought anything yet um we'll send we'll start sending them emails for we'll create a sale we'll create a sale page using clickfunnels and anybody who hasn't bought anything yet will get pushed towards that sales page uh using emails and we'll be using convertkit to figure out who's done what and dude we send a lot of emails we're famous for that and get a lot of unsubscribes as well yeah I was going to ask like is the goal just to send as many emails so people unsubscribe like how do you think about unsubscribes and should you feel bad about them we tried to clean out our um list during these campaign so during Black Friday summer sale Prime day and a back to school sale um we're not emailing every single person on our list so we have 130,000 people on our list today although we don't do many list building activities outside of running Facebook ads um we will find us like um a cohort or or a segment of that of that email list and we'll use that but generally I mean we're try we're we're threading a thin line between uh sending too much getting too many unsubscribed like always testing that um but we have a lot of data from the last like 16 or 14 years on doing this now so we I think we've got a good your question is what how do we think about it we try to make the most sales with the least amount of unsubscribed but we're also okay if people opt themselves out of what we're selling as well because there there are people who probably just never want to buy anything that we have uh and then they can just continue consuming our free content on YouTube and that's that's also fine with us but but I also feel you know we have the biggest YouTube channel for our topic which is facilitation um hundreds of hours of free content out there so we're also we feel like we call it like the Goodwill bucket um whenever we do a big campaign like that where we feel like okay we're pushing it maybe pushing it a little bit um we we're also trying to make sure our go goodwi bucket of free stuff is is being filled up yeah I think that's smart I think that's smart it also probably helps you with your overall conversion rate like if someone finds you via Facebook ad and you know dude it's the big so we everybody who starts working on funnels with me one of their first questions is how do you track whether you know how do you track exactly which things are creating which conversions like so that I know should I put more energy into LinkedIn or into YouTube or into whatever uh and you know there's a lot of products that can help you track these things like hyros is one of these products and I in the end just we don't what did you call it hyos I don't know how you say it hyros hyros h h y r oos hus okay cool this tells you like I I think it tells you if someone comes all the way from YouTube and it tracks all the conversions all the way through we don't pay so much attention to that that and honestly the this is because I took advice from Sam ovens which is don't [ __ ] bother tracking it just you you have your monthly p&l you just make sure your company is growing and that your you know expenses are a lot lower than your incoming and just focus on like the Facebook ad spend Roi and you can assume that having really great content out there builds trust um the people in the clickfunnels community call it a shadow funnel meaning like someone sees your ad the next thing they're going to do is see if you're real and if they find a like six years of high quality YouTube content out there they're going to be a lot more relaxed about going into your funnel than if you're just completely invisible on the internet we might have to do a part two of this like how to build funnels dude I am obsessed with that I'd love to do I would need to have like um like being able to use like the Whiteboard sort of thing I would I would happily do a live with you but it would need to be like 3 or 4 hours long uh I would happily do that and I can go through we could make a funnel for someone or like for for a product I I would love to do that I love making funnels I love copyrighting if people if people want that comment on YouTube uh so we know um and that could be something that we do you know one of the biggest parts of funnels is copyrighting yeah I spent today I spent from I think I spent six hours today sitting with my team rewriting copy like that's why I'm honestly so tired it's just copy copy is honestly the hardest part of my job like take the most out of me yes you know my favorite thing ever is when we were doing our Partnerships with other companies we were working with a company last week and when I can come up with an angle for them and a sentence for them that just makes them go oh my oh that's it that's like the one of the most satisfying things of all time like Laura and I who run AJ and smart we obsessed with the nerdy elements of copy it's so it's crazy how much of a conversion rate difference it can make that's your uh Don Draper moment yeah can I tell you one copy hack like yes that you can there's two copy hacks actually so when you're writing copy for copy is just like text right like just in case anyone's wondering what the hell we're talking about um one of the biggest things when you're writing copy and you're trying to figure out is it good or not especially for a landing page is you can ask yourself the question does this copy push towards the idea that it will increase someone's status so this is a really big thing it means that oh I held it up to the screen and I realize not everyone listens the idea is that we're often writing copy when we're writing about a product we're not thinking about the fact that people often buy things because of St status like will this make me look better to my peers and and you think you think like when you're selling corporate training like we do well then we should never lean on the status thing but of course if you learn something that makes you more valuable to your colleagues in work your status increases because more people want you to do things and so we lean right into that and it's it makes a massive difference to sales if you push towards this idea of helping people increase their status and not in kind of like a again it's not like if you buy this cool watch then you're going to have a higher status it's if you are more useful to other people you will be perceived as higher status and it's all very different for different uh topics and different companies that's one the second thing is if you're stuck trying to figure out what the hell do I write for this headline like I'm trying to sell this microphone or something then you can you can draw this thing which is kind of cool which I'll draw and show here but I'll also explain it um so on the left it says pain and on the right it says pleasure I'm sure a lot of you already know this because you've got smart people in your audience and when you're writing copy you can figure out whether you want to write copy that moves people away from pain so away from pain is like um never carry around like this microphone is battery controlled so it doesn't need this like Phantom energy thing uh if anyone knows like a lot of microphones need to be plugged into a much bigger thing for them to work so with this microphone if we were talking about moving away from pain we would say uh never get stuck in the airport without your podcast equipment again or something like this because you can fit it in your pocket doesn't need Phantom energy so that's moving away from pain because it's reminding you of a painful situation that happens to you moving towards pleasure would be talking about how beautiful this thing is and how nice sounds so it's talking about the positives and sometimes depending on the economy this is something that a lot of people talk about in the marketing space when the economy is really bad and things are going to [ __ ] then you want to make copy or and especially if you're selling like some sort of Education Service you want to talk about moving away from pain so during covid a lot of Market a lot of marketing was about moving away from pain in Good Times uh and and prosperous times you talk a lot about moving towards pleasure it's just another little hack when I get stuck writing copy that's really good I've actually never heard of that I learned it from I think it was Dean graziosi on Twitter like [ __ ] six years ago or something or on stage at clickfunnels funnel hacking live just all the all these kind of old school telemarketer guys I love that people don't really pay the pay attention to them because they have a lot of really good like they read all these old copyrighting books like Dan Kennedy all these kind of like old school marketers they have some really good um copyrighting tips like they invented this topic and we're all just too cool to to learn it now but I'm definitely not too cool to learn we're too cool with our gold Rolexes I'm going to get three gold Rolexes minimum so that I can open my ads account I have another random idea for you I don't know if I have time for I think I gotta go [ __ ] what if I say it in one sentence what if I say it in one sentence yeah say it in one sentence now that weed is legalized in so many places there are people like me who don't like the smell of it and now it's everywhere it comes into your apartment if someone can figure out a way to get rid of that smell and and help with this issue um they're going to make trillions for both the people who are smoking and the people who are receiving the smoke from in cities in cities especially but how how would you do that I have been kind of hacking together my own system here and that's that's a longer episode but if people can like making a website based on this search term like getting rid of weed smell from Neighbors and just turning that into affiliate links to specific air purifiers things like this um like doing like something like the wire cutter but for this specific problem dude I don't know maybe it won't make billions I'm surprised you said website when you could have said turn it into a funnel well we do we have a huge distinction between websites and funnels what is that distinction the distinction is a funel one sentence in one sentence a website is a business card just saying here's all the stuff we do a funnel is a step-by-step process to bring someone from being a stranger to a customer beautiful all right JC J ice scream Jay scream Jonathan Corney Greg I missed you I missed you too dude I missed you too I wish I I had turned up in a more like non manic state but you know just full disclosure for the listeners I was texting you and you were not responding for weeks yeah I know I was traveling dude I was uh I was in your beautiful country getting my brain melted by so many different C things going on it's good fun I mean I was literally here here Thursday August 29th bro come on the Pod no response no response no no response then finally I write I finally finally you respond and then I just wrote I just miss you no response imagine imagine texting someone being like I miss you and not responding oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] at at least any of the other people who are listening to this podcast who know me and have the same problem with me now don't feel like I'm just attacking them individually by not responding to stuff yeah dude I have to tell you off the off the podcast how the last six weeks have been because it's crazy you'll you'll forgive me you'll forgive me it's been real catch you on the next one dude it's been thank you so much thanks for having me back on of course you're welcome anytime [Music] baby

Title: Cursor AI tutorial for beginners
Published: 2024-09-13 14:07:23 UTC
Description:
In this episode, I am joined by Ras Mic, a full stack engineer & YouTuber, where we dive deep into the frameworks and strategies on how to best use Cursor AI. Mic shares his unique insights into how to use and set up Cursor to make the experience of building on top of Cursor as easy and seamless as possible. Learn how to use Cursor like a pro!

1) Plan before coding 
• Sketch out ideas (Figma, iPad, paper)
• Use V0 for mockups (10-15 prompts minimum)
• Set your AI assistant up for success
"Half the game is acting like a developer" - Mike

2) Use cursor.directory for better prompts 
• Copy tech-specific prompts
• Create .cursor_rules file in project root
• Drastically improves Cursor's output
Pro tip: Customize prompts for your exact tech stack

3) Tag relevant documentation 
• Add official docs to Cursor (Next.js, Supabase, etc.)
• Ensures up-to-date, accurate responses
• Cursor reads docs when answering queries

4)  Ask other AI models when stuck 
• Copy errors to Claude, GPT-4, etc.
• Include failed solutions for better context
• Different models can solve problems others can't

5)  Use AI to explain code 
• Great for learning & documentation
• Ask to explain like you're a beginner
• Follow up on confusing concepts
"The more you do this, the more you learn patterns" - Mike

6) Leverage existing code templates 
• Start with boilerplate (auth, DB, payments)
• Build on top of proven foundations
• Saves time on repetitive tasks

7) Add comments to your code 
• Ask AI to explain & document your code
• Improves readability & understanding
• Great for team collaboration

8)  Duplicate & modify existing functionality 
• Copy working code from other parts of your project
• Ask AI to adapt it for new use cases
• Provides context for better results
Key takeaway: Give AI as much context as possible for best results!

if you're anything like me you've been down the cursor AI Rabbit Hole the idea of taking an idea and turning it into a code in a few minutes is just so amazing but before we get ahead of ourselves I think it's really important to uh know the best practices when using cursor Ai and I found this guy that you've probably never heard of he's got like a couple thousand followers on Twitter and the way he explains best practices around using cursor AI really clicked for me so I I brought them on uh the Pod hope you enjoy uh and I think that it this video is going to save you hours and hours of time uh because it's going to give you the foundations of how to actually build something that's going to work and uh that's what we're that's what we're about here taking ideas and making them work so enjoy [Music] all right so I had a question about cursor and there's a few people I call when I have a question about cursor but one of my main people is my man Mike and I had a simple question I said how could you get the best results from cursor AI we're all playing with cursor uh we're stumbling we're following we're falling um and my man Mike is going to teach us in this video how to get the best results um and this man this man knows so thank you for coming on well again thank you for uh the opportunity uh super excited to share some of my findings and I I guess we can uh get straight to it that's what we do we get straight to it you know like that's that's what this channel is about yeah I love it no long intro and we're just getting straight to it so yeah I think um so I've been for for context I'm a a front developer um in my uh current place of employment I do full full stack and I've been playing with cursor for the last couple weeks mainly because I wasn't really a big fan of like the other co-pilots that were available like GitHub co-pilot so decided to give cursor a shot and I think a lot of people are starting to enjoy it but I I realized there are a couple things that I think if people made these tweaks at least I believe the output would be different and this is my personal experience so the first thing I would really say is planning um I don't think it makes sense to just jump on cursor go on the composer and just start asking it to build stuff I really do think even if you're using AI you're not a developer you should have that developer mindset where you plan on what you're going to build what it kind of looks like I would even go as far as having some sketches that you can go on paint or figma or even handwritten and really have like some sort of picture in mind reason being is when whenever you're prompting these AI models you want to give it as much context as possible you you don't want to assume it's smart and you don't want to make the AI the boss you're the boss the AI is the co-pilot right so the biggest thing I would say is is planning and um I don't see enough people planning I see people just jumping on composer and telling you to make stuff and I think your outputs would be really really great if you did a lot if you did planning before you go to cursor so this step I call the measure twice cut once strategy so you measure twice um you you know I I I think yeah figma is where you want to start right yeah 100% like somewhere where you can draw like if you don't have figma it's too difficult for you paint whatever it is just like you know even if you're not a developer start to think and act like one you know what I mean like half the game is acting like one and do you have any anything you can share of planning documents or something like that that people can have a look at so they get a sense around okay I think I understand what do I actually do and this is pretty funny my uh like very first I would say product that uh popped off I don't know if I have it in my Apple notes but I literally just drew on my iPad let me see if I can pull it up here just sketches and there are also AI platforms that you can use let me see if I could pull it up here can you see my screen oh baby do I see your screen yeah so this is like something simple and this was before we even had cursor this was just Chad gbt um and I think I was doing some client work I think this is for client work where I literally just drew this out and this is like some portfolio page for like a uh web3 client of mine and I took this screenshot uploaded to chat gbt and we didn't even have like code or anything like that but basically we didn't have Claud or anything like that but basically I just asked it um what should my how should I plan this out what should my structure be I wanted I wanted it to look like this what should I do and I already know what I was going to do but this was me sort of like building uh this was me asking my assistant my co-pilot for some advice um oftentimes in uh the programming world you you call this rubber ducking where you're talking to a fictional duck that doesn't exist but basically explaining what you're thinking and in in in doing that you kind of start to have realizations and maybe this isn't the smart way of doing things maybe this is a great way of doing things and I think with AI you can do uh that a lot better and not only that I know I'm sure people are familiar with uh v0 but I highly highly suggest that at least if you're not not going to plan with like Figo and stuff like that at least start with v0 reason being is I I I find it it really helps visualizing what your potential app MVP whatever it is will look like and vzer is great for that so for example let's say shh don't tell anyone but I've got 30 plus startup ideas that could make you millions and I'm giving them away for free these aren't just random guesses they're validated Concepts from entrepreneurs who've built hundred million plus businesses I've compil them into one simple database compiled from hundreds of conversations I've had on my podcast but the main thing is most of these ideas don't need a single investor some cost nothing to start I'm pretty much handing you a cheat sheet the idea bank is your startup shortcut cut just click below to get access your next cash flowing business is waiting for you uh I want to build a clean looking Marketplace website for bicycle sellers I don't know something random right and what's great with vzer um is that you can just keep going and going and I I truly believe this is where you start and and once you have a sense of okay this is what I kind of want to build then you take this over to cursor then you take this over to clot or whatever AI model you want to use I think people are jumping straight to claw or or to cursor and sure you can get results but I think VZ or maybe drawing it out is where you start and what I love about VZ is um because it's built using shaten UI which is a UI uh Library you can really get nice looking uh UI and this is just one one prompt if I like I could ask it for maybe a better gradient maybe more rounded edges maybe a testimonial section it even gave me a footer and all I would do is literally just copy this code and take it over to cursor and now cursor has something to build on top of which I truly believe is where it shines best so go back to that wireframe that you had before right here I feel like and correct me if I'm wrong like it almost makes sense even before you get into vzer to draw it out yeah and you know what we can even test this out why don't I drag and drop this into vzero this is what I'm talking about the live cooking starts this wasn't even planned so drop the screenshot um I want to build a web3 portfolio uh I spell portfolio on portfolio website refer to the wire frame web 3 do you want to include web three oh did I not say oh I meant miss the three please and thank you and one thing I don't know if this actually helps but I'm nice to my Ai and I seem to be getting great results so this is live I didn't plan this I didn't even know I had these screenshots and so it's cooking okay got the search Yep this is what I live for so we went from this screenshot this drawing on my iPad to this and now what's cool about this is I can start getting specific and saying move the search bar to the right um and then what if I do that it's going to move the search here so this is just a great place to start and I think a lot of people uh would benefit spending a good chunk of time here uh just because as a developer especially when I'm working on like software that people will actually use not just like a side project you have to spend a lot of time planning making sure you know what it looks like because whenever you start coding that's not the time where you should be thinking about what you should do you should already know what you should do and then just start writing code from there so I really do believe people would benefit massively draw something up whether it be figma your iPad pencil paper whatever it is take a picture of that place it over at V Z and start prompting with v0 like you can go far like I would say minimum you should go at least 10 to 15 prompts with v0 and get what you want to build as close as possible to what you've envisioned and it's very possible like v0 is that good so that's at least where I would start in the beginning no cursor so far step one of being good at cursor don't go on cursor exactly exactly like that's why I have you you're here for the hot takes all right what what else what else you got yeah so that's that's number one so planning like spend as much time planning daydreaming visualizing drawing vzer is a great friend and I like the name vzer because it literally is your version zero and then SEC second is I know the devs might know this but a lot of people are getting to cursor don't know this there's a site called cursor. directory and it's a pretty sick site and basically what cursor. directory is there are these prompts that you can copy and paste and place in your cursor codebase and essentially what this does is this is like the um like this is the initial prompted will read before you even get to prompted anything so let's say I'm building an app that uses nextjs right I can go here and search nextjs click that here and then I see that there's six different uh prompts I can copy so if I click on this one right here this is what you would copy paste to cursor it says you are an expert in typescript nodejs nextjs app rer react shat CN UI radics UI and tailwind and then there's just a bunch of best practices that cursor should follow for nextjs and the reason why this is important is because sometimes the models have a tendency to pull outdated information um it's not that it's wrong but it's just outdated so what this does is you are setting up your cursor codebase for success and all you literally do is you go to this site you copy this uh text and they even have an instruction I believe it's uh in about yeah so if you go about it tells you copy and add do cursor rules file in the root of your project so I can even show a live example of this just to tie the picture home actually we'll do this for one of my project for my portfolio set right now so let me know okay you can see that right so this is my portfolio site simple nextjs codebase the way this would work is I would go on cursor and I would create a new file in the root folder and it would be called cursor rules that's it right cursor rules and then what I do is I search what technologies my uh the what technologies I'm using to build whatever I'm building I'm using nextjs I'm I'm kind of a nextjs fanboy so I'll go to nextjs I'll read through these this one seems to be the closest to what I'm building with and if I want I can always tweak it so I copy that and then I paste that here and all I do is save and I'm good to go so now every time I prompt cursor I either bring the uh composer view or the side AI chat every time I prompt it it's going to know what my codebase is based on because of thist cursor rules file so highly highly suggest again it's cursor. directory all you have to do is just find what technology you're building with if it's python you go you go to python copy it and then create a cursor rules file paste it in there and I've literally seen Night and Day Results just by this simple uh implementation so highly suggest people do this I mean it makes sense right it's like why wouldn't you go use this 100% And I I think it just takes 30 seconds of work and here's what's cool let's say you're using u a set of technologies that um are not listed here what you can do is you can copy a couple of these go to Claude or gbt or whatever and be like I'm actually using these Technologies can you write something similar following this flow for these technology copy paste W that works yep so we can we can let's why don't we again let's do live example so let's say I'm going to copy this I'm going to say I'm building an application or let me say a web application using uh react and python python I want to write a nice prompt for my AI similar to the one below please be just as concise right and I don't even spell things properly but let's see and then I'll paste that um and then let's hit enter so it says here is so here it is you're an expert in react python scalable up applications key principles right concise you literally got the same thing dependencies react 18 Python and it even got the versions right too react 18 typescript react router axios fetch aper Implement code splitting lazy loading and react so your SES load yeah this is great so even if you don't have an En cursor directory copy one or two examples um prompted the way I just prompted and if there's something maybe you want to use react 17 or 16 for some reason I don't know why or you want to use JavaScript you know tell it you know um I actually want to use JavaScript not typescript and then you can manually edit that yourself or I can just be lazy tell it to do that and then look react JavaScript see right here it mentions it react JavaScript use functional components so crazy right so again this is before we haven't even started using uh cursor to write any code so highly suggest that you implement cursor directory um because it just makes your prompts on cursor the results at least you get from cursor are much much better yeah I mean both those things Nob brainer Nob brainer and and and I think they're easy to do right the planning is fun because you're in your creative process and cursor directory literally takes 30 seconds the planning is fun I will say I I I'm one of those people that I just need to like get into it you know and I think a lot of people are like that but I have to it sounds like I need to stop myself and just sort of take a breather start writing it down use use you know a figma or something like that that um the cursor directory to me is like quite literally thank you uh for just saving me time no problem yeah and I think to like to your point I'm that type of person too like well where even to this day I just like jumping into the coding because I I do enjoy writing code uh but I will say two things first you save yourself a lot of headache and I think that one PE that people who might not be developers who are getting into building stuff using AI I really think one thing that people need to start to embrace is the pain because there's a lot of pain when it comes to just building things in general especially um now with like these tools there will be a lot of times where you'll get stuck and you won't know what to do and then you'll flipflop and then maybe you want to go this direction or that direction and this is coming from personal experience it just saves so much time even if it's maybe not the coolest way of starting it just saves so much time planning and I think you you set up your uh AI assistant your co-pilot for Success when you already have a lot of the information ready right um I don't think that models are at a point where it's good enough to just start from scratch we'll get there eventually uh but if you're trying to build something that people actually use I really do think you should really have that developer mind where you know you might not be doing things you like but you're starting off with planning and then those plans creating some mockups setting up your cursor directory and then going about uh programming but from like a side project perspective have fun have as much fun as you want go oneshotting you know break stuff like that that's the that's you know it's a learning process in it of itself you learn a lot doing that uh but when you want to build something and you're and it's you know something of importance I definitely think the planning should happen at least try That's My Hope cool what do you mean by tagging docs yeah so um very important when you're building something um to know what technologies You're Building you might not need to know how exactly they work but it's super important to um know um the Technologies You're Building because every technology you're using to build has documentation so for example um a lot of people whether they know it or not are using nextjs so if I go to nextjs dorg um and then I click on right I essentially have the documentation to everything next to you is how it works um how things are what like you know how routing Works Pages Works layouts and all this stuff and one thing I would suggest even if you're non-technical person I would highly suggest maybe just taking a breeze at things just take a look at stuff if something doesn't make sense take a screenshot give it to I tell it to explain to you S5 but what I mean by tagging docs is let's go to curs here something cool that you can do on composer is I can hit add and then I you see this docs right here I can click docs and then I can click add doc add new Doc and then I can literally copy let me just make sure I'm getting this URL I could paste it here and I'll call this nextjs docs and then it should save so now inside my cursor I have access to the nextjs docs and the reason why this is important is because again a lot of these models you know scrape the internet and all that stuff in a specific time maybe some of that information is outdated maybe it's not best practices right any technology you're using the docks are usually the best source of Truth so now I have access to the docs and I can say um how can I build a simple page that says hello world I hit enter so now it's going to take in notice how it's reading the getting started page Dynamic modules building your application so I've literally given cursor um the latest and greatest information when when it comes to setting up uh an xjs application so not only do I get the code set up but I also get commands on how to run it and I think one thing that people should do even if you're not a developer again act like it until you become one I would highly suggest like going to whatever Pages it mentioned so it said here getting started so let's see if it's slash getting started I don't know if this is the page oh it's not the page maybe it's here right here getting started okay can't find the page but you get my drift you get my drift I really think um like as people are building they should use the building moment as a learning uh moment and that's essentially what I mean by tagging docs so let's say another technology that people might use for their databases superbase so I'll just search superbase docs and then I'll just copy this right here and then let me uh create a new composer view I'll just add docs oh pre-populated some dogs here I'll add a new one paste the link hit enter and then I'll name this super base docks and then hit confirm and now I have access to literally all this information here I don't really have to read through this I can just ask composer this and what this does is every time I have an issue um I can tag these docs and cursor can debug the issues I'm having with the most upto-date information right so it just makes your life way more easy right because we're all going to run into these bugs and you know when you see that CA of red you want to get out of there as quick as possible so yeah this seems like aot makes a lot of sense also it's it sounds like it's really helpful for like if you're a beginner a beginner cursor user or beginner developer call them that learning about all these different Frameworks and platforms like for example superbase or nextjs like I think your your recommendation around go and just read all these doc doents is just going to get you up to speed so that you kind of speak the language and you understand the ecosystem right exactly and and and that's half like that's half the battle really is just knowing what these words mean and I think with AI like you can expedite that process right so if you know the Technologies You're Building you're building with and you have access to the docs and your AI has access to the docks it like every time you get into an issue it's easy for the AI to solve it and in solving it you start to understand how things work right I think this is one of those things where if people are used to learning then doing it's going to be a tough time because it's one of those things you're going to do it's going to break and then you're going to do again it's going to break and then the when it works you realize oh this is how it works you just learned something new right and and I think so far the first three points have really just been preparing cursor with all the information and I I think context is key with all these AI models a lot of people think AI is just magic where it just knows stuff no it just has a lot of context already pre-built in so what you and I are doing um is just giving it as much context as possible with what we're building with what we're doing so it's sort of aligned with us right it it's almost like hiring a new employee and this is the onboarding phase cool quick ad break let me tell you about a business I invested in it's called boring marketing.com so a few years ago I met this group of people that were some of the best SEO experts in the world they were behind getting some of the biggest companies found on Google and the secret sauce is they've got a set of technology and AI that could help you outrank your competition so for my own businesses I wanted that I didn't want to have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I didn't want to depend on ads to drive customers to my businesses I wanted to rank high in Google that's why I like SEO and that's why I use boring marketing.com and that's why I invested in it they're so confident in their approach that they offer a 30-day Sprint with 100% money back guarantee who does that nowadays so check it out highly recommend boring marketing.com what do you mean by asking other AI yeah so there will be times that cursor gets stuck and I've experienced this where I have a simple bug the fix is is pretty simple like I see it I know how to fix it but I'm trying to understand like how would I go about doing this if I was just using Ai and the easiest thing I've realized and a lot of people um have said that I'm wrong on this but what I realized is whenever cursor is stuck even though I'm using CLA within cursor I realize when I copy that same issue that same bug and I paste it over to Claude even though it might be using the same model it actually like it'll be act it'll be able to actually solve it now I'm not a I don't understand how AI models really work but I've kind of based on my own workflow realized like if it's continuously getting stuck that's probably the time to consult another AI model maybe go to Claud maybe go to vzer maybe go to even Chad gbt whatever it is but what I've realized recently works even better is giving whatever AI model you're going to the bug that you that you experienced the solutions that it tried to give in didn't work because when you do that you're essentially is telling it hey um this is the issue these are the solutions it tried it failed you need to do something new and when I started doing that the results were much much higher again context is king So instead of just copy pasting the bug and giving it to the next AI model it will probably give you the same solution again but what you do is you give it the solutions it tried that it failed even give it the output you're getting and what you're expecting and I've seen time and time every time I do that the result are just much much better so if you're stuck with cursor take the bug copy paste the code that's giving you an issue the red squiggly lines copy paste the potential uh fixes that he gave but failed give that all to another AI model the results on Next Level so that's what I mean by asking other AI or other assistants cool and you even said chachy BT when all fails yeah the bottom yeah the bottom of your list you know it's funny just how things have Chang changed like over the last few weeks even it is like I pay for cursor v0 Claude I don't pay for Chad gbt and I I don't think I ever will uh truth I think Claude like Claude is great for like everyday task plus programming cursor is C cursor and vzer is just great for starting in UI components Chad gvt just seems you know so me mid basically but who knows maybe the next model sweeps us totally maybe who knows who knows okay cool what else uh what else do you want to talk about yeah so um some things that cursor is great at that I highly recommend or AI in general is great at is number one let's say um and this is more for developers let's say you have some code already written and you want to open source it or you want to explain it to somebody else asking AI models to explain what's already written in 10 out of 10 probably the best thing I think as a developer the most annoying thing is writing documentation and AI is great at that but I I'm I'm assuming most people who are watching this are not developers so to the next Point explaining code and teaching code so let's give a live example here I have um my portfolio site here let's go on maybe the projects card so this is just some simp simple code um and basically what this code does is just to give you a visual representation is on my portfolio you see these project cards and you see like this hover like when you hover that follow nice touch I appreciate that thank you I pride myself in good design that's what this component does right so um I actually have done this already I have some comments already written here that I use AI to write but let's say I go here and then I I'll do command shift L explain this code to me like a beginner I want to know the flow logic and overall how things work please and thank you so copy this component and now this is what's going to do so okay certainly I'd happily explain this code component setup this code defines a react component called blog card it is a client component indicated by use client at the top so if I go to the top okay so use client this is a client component which means it uses react Hooks and handles client side interactions so let's say this doesn't make sense to me I'll copy this over and then ask it again right and it says the components except three props State and refs Mouse movement Handler outer container so it literally breaks things down to you and then what I would do is when you read something that doesn't make sense um I can literally copy this and be like what does this mean and then hit that use client directive when you use client at the top of the file of next Chase it is telling next CH that the component should be rendered on the client side in the browser rather than on the server okay so when I add use client this file is being rendered or basically in a very simple ter it's being cooked on the browser versus on the server so the more you do this I know first glance this might seem difficult but you know it's like a snowball effect the more you do this the more you learn these little things you start to catch and understand patterns and truthfully speaking I know a lot of devs will hate me for this but if you understand the patterns enough and we assume the models will continue to grow um in the way that they're growing which is not linear but exponential like we can get to the point I don't I'm not saying we're there yet I I still think the El have a way to go but we can get to a point if someone invest time now that they can get really good at building stuff that works um and that's what I mean by I think um cursor or any model Claude especially they are really great at explaining code and like teaching Concepts so highly recommend as as people are building um to just ask it to explain what did you do here what do you mean by this how does this work um is there any other way to do this and I really think it would benefit people especially as they go on as the models get better to know these things now totally it sounds like it might take you a little bit longer but in the in in the short term but in the long term you'll be more self-sustaining you'll understand more you'll be able to build quicker you'll understand the landscape more yeah and I think that's kind of where like my viewpoint is like I see a lot of like there are a lot of companies for example building like agents a lot of startups doing this that and the third and then there's a part of me that's like all that we're seeing right now is just the early version of stuff right even cursor I I don't doubt cursor if they keep going this trajectory one two years from now is going to be a whole different monster so it's in my opinion that anyone who is watching this or or in the space right now that they invest time in learning this stuff not because they'll make meaningful change now but when the models get really really good maybe in the next 6 months a year two years you have been well prepared and you you're just the timing of things will be perfect right so I know there's a lot of people like oh there's no point in being a developer now like being a developer is done I I think in fact the best time is now because not only will you be able to know how to code but you have these models that will probably at some point code better than you and it will at least explain Concepts to you it's unreal like I've learned like I do freelancing on side and I've learned so much of new technologies that if I didn't have these tools would have taken me time like I'm mostly a web dev mobile Dev picked it up in literally a week in a week now does it help that I know how to program and stuff yes but what would have taken me some time has literally taken me a week and not only did I learn how to build but I built while I learned and I think a lot of people if they just stick to the pain for the next couple months when these new models come I think you'll be in a great position I love it anything else you uh want to add yeah um I I I would say adding comments to code kind of showed that here right if you write some code and you want to know how this works you can literally ask it um add comments to my code I already have them here so I won't show that and the last thing I would say is duplicating what already exists so let's say um and I can't think of an example so hopefully people can catch the theory I'm about to share but let's say you have um some sort of functionality on one page that um does something and it does it really really well and you have to do something similar on another page but with a Twist what I've seen helps is you copy that code or you copy that functionality and you say this works for this page can we do the same thing for this page but and then explain exactly what you want done and the more I I talk about these things I realize it's just the more context you give your AI models the better um answers they will give you so I noticed that if you already U have existing functionality and you want to do something different but it's very similar um referencing that existing functionality really really helps and I guess one tip I would have and I know we talked about this and I'm sure um cursor and all these AI platforms will probably do this is if you can have like a template that already has and I know replate is doing this with their latest announcement if you have a template that already um has a lot of boiler PL code like let's say has a landing page has authentication like Google Au and all that set up for you uh maybe a database integration a dashboard if you can have that and build on on top of that that to me I think is the is the smartest way of doing things for example I can give a simple example here um if I open my cursor here so this is my starter kit and basically what I realize is especially when I'm doing freelance work or side projects is I sort of do the same thing and again and again I need a landing page I need uh payments with stripe I need a a dat database I need authentication where people should be able to log in with um Google or or email or whatever it is or two- Factor authentication and I kept building the same thing again and again so what I did was I built one based on the different projects uh I've done put it together so every time I as a developer forget I as a developer in building something I always start with my starter kit and it's to my understanding that I know quote me on this cursor and all these AI models will do this is they will start providing people with templates that they can build off of so one thing I would highly suggest I have my own it's free you don't have to pay for it I know some people charge you can use my template or you can find a template you can liter go on GitHub and be like nextjs starter template or react starter template find one that a lot of people are raving about and download that code and use it in your cursor I think that is probably the best place for people to start uh when it comes to developing if they're trying to build something serious right because authentication is hard I'm not going to lie setting up your DP from scratch is hard but if you find these templates and there's a lot of them out there and you build on top of that you're cooking dude this is everything I wanted and more this is like the de facto how to get the most out of cursor video and I appreciate you sharing that free template too with everyone highly recommend people check out uh Mike's YouTube channel and and just his content he's thrown out there it's dope and uh and thank you for your time um there we we did another video for people uh with a starter template around we created um basically a social media app in in like 90 minutes so you can if people are interested you can you can check out that video I I'll link it uh in the description we can use the comment sections on YouTube as just like people who are building and Mike maybe you can I'll I'll be in there uh Mike maybe you jump in here comment a little bit um and uh and let's all build some cool stuff yeah um again Greg thank you so much for your time I'm really really appreciate it um don't take it for granted and if anybody has any questions you can leave them in the comments I will 100% reply um I don't want to say all of them cuz you get a lot of comments to as many of them as I can um and just like the AI models add as much context as possible please um and yeah again thank you so much uh for this time I really appreciate it cool yeah and if if people if people like this and found it fun and interesting um maybe we'll do it again so please let us know yep let me know and maybe I'll be back love it thanks a lot man all right bye [Music] baby

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
getting started with something simple is the best way to get more ideas to build a tiny audience to get feedback to learn there's just so many things that just roll after that having a course a book I think it's the easiest way to get started and so yeah the that's the entire point is to start with something simple um there's this sense as a business owner that if you charge a subscription then you will get monthly recuring Revenue so you get $10 in January you're going to get $10 in December and you know it's going to keep going like this but what I do is I tend to remove any subscription and I really ask myself do I need that subscriptions a friend of mine is telling me if you have a recuring payment you should provide recurring value you need to build that idea cuz that idea is so smart I'll build that with you I need man I'm I need a notepad right here that's a successful startup ideas podcast when you have to pull out your notepad you're like okay let me just take a note on that [Music] all right I am so excited to have you mark on the show on the startup ideas podcast you know on my Mount Rushmore of Indie hackers I've got you know Peter levels I've got Danny postma and I definitely have Mark Lou so um I finally got you to come on agree to come on the Pod you're here and uh welcome man thank you so much big fan of the P i' I've watched a lot of episodes and I'm I'm happy to be finally in here you're you're here man you're here and and you came prepared too which I love so you've got a list of a bunch of ideas um and I take your ideas very seriously because you've been able to you've been able to build a pretty big audience on YouTube You've you know you've you you've made you know and revenue millions of dollars uh at this point um so which one of these ideas do you want to start with because they're all pretty interesting um just before we get started I'm I got lots of ideas lots of them are terrible but I try all of them and eventually some of them ended up working so whatever I prepared some of them might not be the best but uh it crossed my mind and uh I think it's worth exploring yeah and it's funny because sometimes like the bad ideas end up being the good ideas man it's c that that is absolutely crazy that reminds you that even with years of experience you'll still not really know what you're doing yeah exactly and sometimes you just got to like you just got to put it out there and make it ugly and just see what happens and it it strikes a chord and you're like wow I actually can't believe how bad of an idea this is but it it's actually interesting to people yeah yeah and and sometimes the opposite happens when you think you have an amazing idea you spend two month building it and then nothing happens I guess the open zound I think um um I think one one good part to get started is there is this like gold rush for SAS product but I in because we hear like amazing stories of like a kid who use no code and and make a million dollar using a size product but I think there are tons of products before that that are much simpler to start with and um and I think one of them is teaching what you actually know you probably have a background whether you've been studying something you been I don't know it could be a sport background could be employee backgrounds having a course a book I think it's the easiest way to get started so yeah you're right everyone knows something but how do you know just because you know something doesn't mean the thing that you know is what someone wants to buy necessarily so for example it might be way easier to sell someone how to build a SAS than it is to sell online than it is to sell someone um how to make you know on you know how to make Ceramics or Pottery or cups U maybe there's a big market for that but I just know that the Val the customer value for um how to build SAS maybe is bigger than maybe maybe the ceramic so the question to you is how do you how do you think about the customer here and how much they're willing to pay or does it matter I think that's my case I I like the creation process and I wouldn't think too much about the customer I would still create it and I I would think about something that changed my life and building a sass is one of them but sometimes there are little things that are I'm talking about very simple things but like how to sleep better like for instance I see the impact on my sleep on my day if I have a good night eight hours of sleep I wake up I'm pumped my entire day is like a blessing but now if you're talking about getting the perfect night of of sleep on repeat it's much harder than just being lucky once you need to go to bed at the same time all the time you need a specific temperature you need earplugs you need all these of things and it becomes complicated and this is this is something that you could sell to anyone everybody needs a good night of sleep and I remember in 2021 that's one of the thing that changed my life that could literally something you could build in like you could make a PDF in a day and you can sell that to starts shh don't tell anyone but I've got 30 plus startup ideas that could make you millions and I'm giving them away for free these aren't just random guesses they're validated Concepts from entrepreneurs whove built hundred million plus businesses I've compiled them into one simple database compiled from hundreds of conversations I've had on my podcast but the main thing is most of these ideas don't need a single investor some cost nothing to start I'm pretty much handing you a cheat sheet the idea bank is your startup shortcut just click below to get access your next cash flowing business is waiting for you so that's really interesting so when you when you were saying you know everyone knows something basically package it up and you should you can sell it I was thinking more of like a hobby or something like that but what you're saying is actually no you might just know something about life meaning you might know uh just some life hack basically um like how to sleep better and if you write out like as a prompt what are the you know what are the 10 life hacks that you've learned in your life uh maybe it's how to get to the gym consistently and then what you're saying is okay write write down all the life hacks write a PDF you can you can even use tools like gamma. apppp uh which is uh kind of a really it's like a a tool to really make uh lead magnets quite easily that I've been using have you seen it no I haven't I was Googling it yeah yeah I've been obsessed with it recently um it it if you go to their website it doesn't it doesn't say like we make lead magnets um but I use it for lead pet um and I use it for for just making beautiful websites out of content yeah yeah because design that design matters a lot here and where even if just ideas is very simple having a good learning page like the one you you talk about like this is one of um one of your favorite I think it was a newsletter or tweet of yours that says the tweets size or tweet bite landing page I think man that's such a great way to get started without overthinking you can have a call to action buy a little course here or there and if you do the work to launching a little bit everywhere you know then you learn a lot about what's happening and what's not happening you learn about creating headlines you learn about putting your ideas out there and stop overthinking I think that's the first step when you're starting in this journey even if it seems simple that's the point that's the point of like you're just getting started then you can you know yeah I think the counterargument that someone makes when they hear something like this is they go okay great how to sleep better like I'm GNA go make maybe I can make $50,000 a year um with this but I think what you're saying is and correct me if I'm wrong but I think what you're saying is that could just be the starting Place meaning once you put out this PDF around how to sleep you you might have an idea for a sleep supplement or uh I don't know like an eye mask business right there we go yeah that's the point that's the starting that's the ignition of the business I think there there's a there's the like um sometimes you get this idea and you think that's going to change everything and this you know this is like you Full Throttle all into it but I think it's it's a journey and a ni IDE is just a part of the journey and there there will be so many ideas in that longer journey and getting started with something simple is the best way to get more ideas to build a tiny audience to get feedback to learn um there's just so many things that just roll after that and so yeah that's that's the that's the entire point is to start with something simple if you were let's just say you were creating a digital product around how to sleep better what are your next steps like okay you have the idea and then you know how do you name it how do you you know what how do you generate traffic to it like how do you think about growing a digital product like that okay so for talking about something very simple like creating an ebook to sleep better I would definitely use a medium to share what I'm working on so if it's if I'm comfortable on the camera I'll definitely go on YouTube or TI Tok Instagram if I am better with writing because I'm a little bit introvert then I would go on Twitter and I would learn how to share my ideas learn how to share what I'm currently working on so I can create content out of my daily life and that would create it wouldn't make a buzz at the beginning but I would create an initial traction you would get five to like I don't know 10 people who just look at what you're doing and they will be here when you're launching that's would be the first step yeah I I want to say one quick thing on this so dude I and I I applaud you for doing this but I was I was for a while I was recording the direct to camera videos where I'd be like here's the 10 ways to do XYZ and I and I you know would do these videos and I hated it I hated it man like I I really really it felt really unnatural to me and um whereas like on Twitter and writing and even doing these long form podcasts it feels very natural to me but like writing a script and staring into the camera made me feel very like weird and sometimes feeling weird is like it's not really feeling weird actually uncomfortable sometimes feeling uncomfortable is the necessary evil you need to go through in order to like do something great but at a certain point I was just unhappy and I hated doing it so I think the question for people if they're if they're going to like document their path you have to ask yourself which format is good for you yeah man that I can relate so much to that and if you go back to my Twitter accounts in the very beginning of the journey like 2021 2022 you would see tweets of me but now would cringe because I'm I'm trying to tell people what to do I think the mistake we do and I think it's kind of natural because you open YouTube and you see videos with million views of I don't know Alex hormos who is telling you five mistakes you're making as you know an entrepreneur like there's this like teacher mindset and you're like I'm gonna copy that I'm gonna imitate I'm gonna teach them what I know but at the beginning you don't know anything so you want to start by using I and not you so I did that I learned that and then maybe later in the journey when you start you have a biger following you've learned a lot then maybe you can start teach Ing and telling like you should be doing this or or stuff like that I think it's a good finding the right medium so Twitter like YouTube Instagram whatever this is and finding the formats on how you tell your ideas I think this is this is very important here took me yeah and I think about format a lot too so what what you mean by format is like saying I did that today and not you should do that right and and and how do you like so a lot of people are going to agree with you they be yeah a format but how do you how do you develop your own format you know there's a lot of there's a lot of content around developing your own voice but developing your own voice is very different than developing a format that is going to work and and get shared by people how do you think about that man if those are good question because I can really retrace the beginning of the journey I'm like hey I was actually thinking about that um I think it comes to finding consuming content and picking the little things you like from each creators for instance I like the mindset of P levels to say I did that and having like lots of little projects and I copied that and I put it in my head and I like now it's part of me um maybe some of your audience know Justin well she a really good writer on Twitter I like the way he writes like it's very clear concise super simple to understand I was like okay love that I took the way right and I put it in my head I'm like now that's part of my identity and I mix those con creators in my head and it becomes my identity so my identity is not really my identity actually it's like a mix of lots of things I found everywhere plus what I've discovered along the way but at the beginning this is literally nothing and if you go back to my Twitter you really see that things have changed a lot from the very beginning yeah so it's interesting we were talking about m Rushmore before it's almost like you should create that your own Creator Mount Rushmore for your formats meaning pick three or four people who you really look up to and then write down what is the one or two things that you take away from their content that you want to implement into yours and then from that go and experiment with different you know different formats exactly that cool all right and then okay so then you you start creating content and how do you you know how do you sell the PDF how do you think about pricing it um or ebook oh man pricing could be a could be an entire YouTube video of one hour for for that I think you want to start with a pay wall you don't want you want to avoid launching free things unless you're passionate about unless you have a really good idea and you think it could work otherwise you want to have a pay wall because that teaches you a lot of things um you don't want to price too cheap because obviously when it's cheap people will undervalue the product and as you're getting started if you sell 10 PDF and each PDF is like $1 then at the end of the month you're not even paying the bills so you want to have the motivation and and for that you need to price a little higher than than expected you look at competitors prices for that if you don't know how to price um it's just really a bunch a bunch of a but yeah I would I would go for one time payment for sure at the very beginning especially if you're selling a course I would say one thing you can do is get all the data around like competition like seeing where you sit in competition I think is really helpful so write about you know make a list of all the the data points around what people are selling it for take that data go into uh uh go into you know Claude let's say and do a prompt be like hey I need you to help me price this you're my like pricing partner pretend pretend like you're you know the head the best pricing expert on the planet and that you know I always say like pretend you work at like Walmart or you're the head of pricing at Walmart and the best in the world and you get paid a million dollars a year to do this and here's the data I want to price this product what do you think I should be priced at and why and and that if you're like a solo Indie hacker type person just having going back and forth with AI will help refine what your first price should be yeah it's crazy good though yeah so and then the other thing to note about pricing and by the way comment on YouTube if you want us to do or you know want to do a or you're interested in a pricing episode um I don't know if people are down down for that but um I think uh you can always change your price too right yes I've been playing a lot a lot with that I started with very cheap and cheap subscriptions with a long time free long free trial and then I ended up removing the free trial pricing higher and REM sometimes removing removing the subscription um I think it really depends on the product I think there is a rush towards subscriptions because um there's this sense as a business owner that if you charge a subscription then you will get monthly recing Revenue so you get 10 month on January you're going to get $10 in January you're going to get $10 in December and you know it's going to keep going like this but I think as a customer it's kind of a pain to have subscriptions because you have Netflix Spotify Etc and so in the customer's mind when you see a subscription you're already thinking what happens if I have to cancel and I forget and when you create objections in the mind of the customer at the moment the purchase that is usually impacting your conversion rate and what I do is I tend to remove any subscription and I really ask myself do I need that subscriptions a friend of mine is telling me if you have a recurring payment you should provide recurring value which usually falls in the category of software for businesses like if you're using I don't know like a a scheduling tool because you have calls every week that it makes sense to have a recurring subscription if you look at there's a lot of product that can actually remove the entire subscript ion model and have onetime payment or a system like a credit system that works really well too that's doesn't you know push the customer to like make a big commitments and it's easier to sell who do you think does pricing well what are examples of people who do pricing well before we move on to the next startup idea I just have to ask selfishly examples from Indie hikers or any company could be anything any company I'm interested in it because I'm just interested in companies that do pricing well because I think there's this shift happening right now to your point which is like people are getting sick of monthly subscriptions and so I'm just interested on who's innovating or who's doing interesting things in pricing quick ad break let me tell you about a business I invested in it's called boring marketing.com so a few years ago I met this group of people that were some of the best SEO experts in the world they were behind getting some of the biggest companies found on Google and the secret SEC sauce is they've got a set of technology and AI that could help you outrank your competition so for my own businesses I wanted that I didn't want to have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I didn't want to depend on ads to drive customers to my businesses I wanted to rank high in Google that's why I like SEO and that's why I use boring marketing.com and that's why I invested in it they're so confident in their approach that they offer a 30-day Sprint with 100% money back guarantee who does that nowadays so check it out highly recommend boring marketing.com I nobody really likes paying so there's nothing that comes in mind I think I remember seeing the Met subscription the Met usage where I was like oh that's cool but not a comp I don't have any company in mind one company that comes in mind when it comes to pricing it's it's a smart move on their side but as a customer I don't like it is stripe with the fees if you actually look at your monthly fee that's a lot of money I think that's where I spend the most money in my business like probably $5,000 a month they got three% for the cards plus an extra 1% if the card is not from Europe plus an extra 1% if you're charging another currency and then and plus 0.4% if you want to make an invoice in the end you pay like five to six% so it's smart for the business and as a customer I'm not a big fan of it yeah I think that's that's like the payer per usage model which is the more you use it the more like in theory you're happy because oh you're making all this money then you're happy to give them a cut and if you're not making a lot of money then you don't give them a cut but the reality is it would be great if it was a sliding scale meaning instead of you maybe it's 2.9% let's say 3% I don't know what stripe fees are but let's just say for the sake of this conversation that's 3% up until 100,000 of sales and then for you know 100,000 to a million it's 2% and then a million and more is 1% man yeah that's you just remind me of a pricing I saw that was really smart but it was years ago they were charging higher it's it was a subscription they were charging higher on the first month or they were charging you on the first month for a basine that's they they show on their site and then it decreases after like two to three month and so as a customer you don't want to cancel because otherwise you lose what you already gained by being a customer for the past three months I canot remember the company but I thought it was a really Smart Pricing that is really smart that is really smart like no one's doing that yeah yeah that makes me want to ship something and just try just to see that's amazing okay um moving on to your next Idea Idea number two what what do you what do you got all right if we step um all right maybe we can move from that whatever course you you're trying to sell there's something I love and it's maybe speaking to only Gamers out there but I'm a big fan of all the forecraft I've played games for so many years and I try to gamify things that have a purpose in real life so for instance you could gamify your sleep you could score points you can compete with friends you can lose money if you don't get good sleep or if you don't track your habits or something like that I think there's a lot to do in the gamification system because everybody wants better sleep everybody wants to eat better everybody wants to work out and I think there is a game gamification things that could help people achieve their goals and that could be a software by itself so you would have to so I bu I buy the thesis which is gamification helps people do things and create streaks and results so but how would you like which vertical is most interesting you know would you I think sleep is really interesting um but by the way sleep like I'll show you right now like I use eight sleep the mattress and it's like a smart mattress and the first thing I do when I wake up in the morning is I check my sleep Fitness score there you go and so I slept well last night 99% um and then you can see like your REM sleep and your deep sleep so you can see that I like you know it's game it's gamified like this is gamified yeah yeah you're not wearing any ring or anything is it the mattress tell you that just the mattress tells me that I don't know how it does it I don't ask questions exactly yeah yeah I think in this case it's I think it's a mattress company that sells the app on top of that so that eventually on a call on a podcast you would end up talking about the mattress because it's interesting normally you don't talk about a mattress I think that makes a lot of sense but that would require you to already have a business if you're sing a course about how to sleep better you know you could bring a lebard of all the people who purchased and make them compete um for sleep there is sleep an app that was released I think a year ago or something which makes 100 million a year and basically the better you sleep the more your Pokemons will grow and evolv um and they Pokemon sleep is making 100 million dollars a year did I hear that correctly yeah I don't know what is the license fee they pay for the the Pokemon license but he's pretty insane okay wow I'm just reading this now this is this is absolutely Bonkers um they have they made $100 million on 9.8 million downloads so that's pretty crazy like that's to $10 per download yeah it's crazy yeah it's pretty crazy I think the Nostalgia of Pokemon combined with a real life goal that's that's the a big something big okay so here's the unlock here's the idea the idea is this the the idea is there's a we all know the things that people want to do sleep better sleep better eat better all the things um you can you can ask Claude you can ask whoever you can ask your mom these things don't change human beings don't change we all know that gamification leaderboard status badges streaks is a product design tool that helps people achieve their goal it sounds like what what is the unlock that Pokemon sleep has done well they've licensed the intellectual property of Pokemon and they've added that to this whole concept of gamification Etc so the question is the way I'm thinking about this and I'm like really excited about this as you you can see is um what is an opportunity to license a a brand and just BR basically what is poke the idea is this it's Pokemon sleep for a yeah you li you license the IP and by the way people someone's going to be listening to this and and say like well uh yeah easy for them who like they probably paid so much money for Pokemon and and and you'd be surprised like how cheap some of these licenses are to uh to get to get um maybe not Pokemon but like to get amazing licenses for nostalgic intellectual property you'd be surprised how cheap they are I don't want to uh I don't want to say who it is cuz it's it's someone everyone knows but there's someone who I know who got the LIC like went to um basically uh a what do they call it a franch uh not a franchise it's like a intellectual property conference licensing conference in Las Vegas and and he got like a Star Wars for for like a some apparel he basically bought the Star Wars license for some like apparel line and he thought it was going to cost he's like you know Star Wars is huge right and he's like oh my God it's going to cost like millions of dollars a year and it ended up costing uh $50,000 for the first two years and some percentage of sale I think it was like two or three percentage but now all of a sudden you can do Facebook ads with Star Wars on it so huge yeah that's crazy I mean yeah man I would love to grow my Jedi as soon as I ship is start of my lightsabers becomes I don't know double or something just so many and we're talking about General stuff like sleep or workouts but you can go deep into Niche like developers who commit for this is some this is an app I have in mind for for a long time I probably build it it in years from now it's like um every time you make a commit as a developer it's pushed to GitHub and there is like these super addictive GitHub things where you have like a a greed of all your commits across the last 365 days every developers wherever your software engineer using typescript or your pet levels using PHP and doesn't care about anything everybody knows about that and everybody loves his greed and man I I kind I want to bring that in and and make a massive leaderboard of comits or whatever geds something that makes people wants to push some code online this is one of the millions of Niche where you can gamify gamify habits goals yeah dude you need to build that idea cuz that idea is so smart think about um like during the web 3 craze there was an app called sweatcoin I don't know if you saw this but it was basically like based on the amount of steps that you took they would give you this coin um so it gamified walking think about credit card points like the more you use your credit card the more I think uh credit card points meets GitHub uh commits idea is a massive idea if you could be the place that people like the more I commit the more points I get and yes there's a leaderboard but it also allows me to redeem for something I think that's the idea that you should do there you go man that is that is myart way there's a financial incentive yeah okay I'll build that with you I need man I'm I need a nut pad right here that's what the go that's that's a successful startup ideas podcast and you have to pull out your notepad you're like okay let me just take a note on that and do the track record you have because um if that end up working two years from now it's like this idea was born on the startup ideas podcast exactly we documented it I'm I'm really taking note of that one I'll I'll CC you I'll DM you if I ended up building it cool one La we have time for one last idea can I can I pick one okay because there's there's one I'm curious about that I've thought about for many years I almost don't want to bring it up but we'll bring it up because I said it already legal for entrepreneurs what do you mean by that oh okay I thought it was your idea no I want I want I i' I've been I've been exploring this in the space for for a few years now but I haven't built anything in the space so I'm curious what you mean by legal for entrepreneurs oh man I dropped it here because this is the number one question I receive on every YouTube videos I make where did you set up your company how does it work how did you set up your strap account with that company the same question every single time and uh the thing is I I think there is an opportunity for an info product for sure so people understand a little bit better about what what is going on how does it how does the thing work because it's mostly it starts with that and eventually for a service where you have you marketplace where you you match people in their needs and the legal entity that they need I am I am I am terrible at legal stuff like this is something that it pulls my hair so I spend as least time as I can on it but I think there's a real need because people ask all the time I think so too uh I use stripe uh stripe Atlas to like set up my companies um to you know it's just integrated uh with stripe obviously it makes it pretty easy but I wish there was someone I could talk to at stripe Atlas too you know sometimes I'm like I don't know if I should start an LLC versus es Corp and you know what I mean it feels feels like there's an opportunity to make it a little more educational and and have like a more premium version I guess like the idea I have here is more of a premium version of stripe Atlas oh okay I think yeah in your case it's probably like an Advan version maybe for to optimize your textes or something like this yeah I mean it's okay so the example I'll use is uh I you know we set up an LLC for one of our businesses in in the states and it started making a bunch of money and we didn't realize that we should have converted it to an escort and which is another type of Corporation so um and that cost us hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars of taxes and we would have set it up probably as a as an escort from the beginning um but we didn't know because we were just on stripe Atlas um so I wonder so if you think about like legal there's as as a spectrum right on one end of the spectrum you have um calling your like calling my Manhattan lawyer paying my Manhattan lawyer $1,100 an hour to set up a company which is something we've done before you know which sucks like take it's painful literally so painful that you know just it's hurts my soul that that's one end of spectrum and the other end of the spectrum you have selfs serve stripe Atlas type products that for like a couple hundred bucks get you all set up it feels like there's in the middle all right I think yeah maybe because in new your I think you're you're from Canada right I'm originally from Canada yes I think there's um the what I see is from people who are usually not from the US because for for you guys there is this like this easy option of stripe at last and you're American I mean you're you're you're from Canada so I'm a I'm a green card holder so I live in the US now mostly but I'm I'm still it's it's basically I'm like an American yeah so you pay taxes in in the US now yeah I pay taxes in the US I don't pay taxes to Canada okay okay so yeah you've you've been because for for I look I look at my situation I am a French person who is married to a Korean woman and living living FIS like T my tax I pay my taxes in Bell there was an infinite ocean of options where would I pay my taxes where would I pay pay my company where would I open a company because I don't need to open a company necessarily in Indonesia or in France I can open it in Singapore and so you have like so many options and sometimes like yeah but you have STP Atlas in the US where you pay 0% taxes why not opening there and then you realize if you do that then you're not you have you own a company like there and you live in Indonesia it's maybe illegal there's this like entire system where it's like completely [ __ ] up and I think that's why people are asking it's more like not trying to optimize Sexes but to understand the system where should they set up their company in first place so that it's working because you could now that you work with a computer you could work from anywhere in the world you can leave anywhere in the world so there's this like an ocean of options which create as well an otions of thoughts and that's interesting that's interesting yeah I didn't even consider opening a a company outside outside can or the US to me it was like that's where I would open a company because that's all I know um but you're right there are probably other places that I should have considered um for a bunch of reasons yeah and I think for you it also Mak makes sense where you are because you you might have employees Etc so it's the the more things engage for me the company is one person it's me and there is no employee there's no one else there's eventually a contractor to edit my videos but that's that's it and so that guys give me an an an an enormous amount of flexibility to where I go but on the downside where do I go and that that that was the tricky part where I was not really sure where to open first and interesting yeah and people really ask a lot like it's number one question so I guess stripe Atlas for Indie hackers with maybe a little more support is probably an interesting idea um yeah when I looked at stripe At Last At the beginning I was living in France and I hired someone a lawyer and he told me if you own a strip Atlas business in France like you're going to get flagged they they won't like it because it's like zero 0% tax Even Heaven and so either you would get double tax as if it was a French company so in that case that makes zero sense or if one day you got an audit then your F and I was like and that's the moment where I started to realize like wait so so what you know and then there's this entire process of like okay I can have a company abroad but then I need to move abroad as well and then and then yeah and then that's when the troubles somehow somehow started then you have the regulation that changes in every countries because at some point everybody was talking about Dubai that's the place to go and then they changed the regulation and became more expensive or like and I was I was lost I was like okay [ __ ] I'm not going to optimize anything I'm going to do something simple I'm going to go there and boom I like it there's there's something here someone in the comment section is going to be like I'm going to do something so I'm happy you flagged it and and uh I appreciate it Mark Mercy I appreciate you uh coming on and and spending time with us where could people get to know you and your products a little bit more mar.com M cou.com this is where all my websites are my revenue is public and there is my Twitter and YouTube link as well beautiful check it out um I'm a big fan and uh hopefully uh hopefully you come on the pot again sometime it's Che man it was nice nice having me you all right take care [Music]

Title: The ultimate guide to product building with the man who changed software
Published: 2024-09-09 14:00:18 UTC
Description:
I’m joined by Jason Fried, Co-founder and CEO of 37signals, as we deep dive on innovative startup ideas, our frameworks to building products people love, and our thoughts on the current software landscape. 

1)  The "Scratch-off Ad" app idea:
• Full-screen ad you scratch off with your finger
• Blow into mic to clear "dust"
• Chance to win prizes/coupons
• Global, once-a-day experience
Potential: Massive user base, high engagement 

2) "Shower Door Sketch" app concept:
• Simulates drawing on steamy shower glass
• Ephemeral canvas that fogs up & clears
• Add shower sounds for immersion
• Screenshot to save ideas
Perfect for creative brainstorming!

3) Key insight: Bring real-world experiences to digital
• Leverage mystery, surprise, uncertainty
• Create moments that can't be replicated
• Tap into universal human experiences
"There's some sort of deeper universal things to tap into here." - Jason

4)  The power of limitations in software:
• Time-based experiences (HQ Trivia)
• Visit-once websites
• Apps with "open hours"

Creates scarcity & increases perceived value 

5) Hobbyist ethos missing in modern software:
• Early internet had more quirky, fun projects
• Less focus on monetization, more on exploration
• Need for "weirder" apps and experiences
Challenge: How can we make the internet weird again? 

6)  Cozy software movement:
• Make apps feel warm, comfortable
• Contrast to clinical, cold modern design
• Focus on user experience & delight
Goal: Create software people genuinely enjoy using

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
but I'm like well what if what if you can make an ad that is the product what if ads could be the product like how could you get people to look at these things as as if that's the only thing they're there for um now great advertising is one thing but you know that there are very few great ads so anyway here's the idea so I think it could make a ton of money and literally there'd be almost nothing to do to make this thing happen except getting the word out and I think the word would spread so rapidly how much do you think about Mark when you think about an idea how much are you thinking about how am I going to get the first 100,000 people to download this uh I don't think about that at all for me it's like um is the idea any good I don't I think it is do I I don't know let's build something and see and then it it's like a a Goosebumps feeling like I think we're on to something that that to me is the best feeling in product development it's the feeling of I think we're on to something here but a lot of the a lot of it is the software industry is too serious it takes itself too seriously and I just would like to see some more people playing I'll say this I it feels like this idea of cozy software that you're talking about feels like one in one in 100 not 50 and 100 you know most software feels a bit boring right now I'd like to see more weird in software again yeah let's let's make the internet weird again yeah time baby I am so excited to have Jason freed someone I've looked up to for a very long time on the Pod Jason could be anywhere but he has chosen to spend his time with us thousands of people who love startup ideas and uh Builders and uh thanks for being here man yeah it's great to be here Greg thanks for having me on and I said you can only come on if you have an idea yeah yeah and your response was I've got something I can't get out of my head and uh so what's what's going through your head so I have had this idea for a number of years which I don't like actually I don't like it because I think it's good but it's ugly in a sense in that like I actually don't in a sense I don't want to see this idea in the world but there's something about it that seems so simple and that it would be so popular that I can't get out of my head so here's the idea first of all it's Advertising based which I don't like to begin with so the whole the whole premise of this I don't like okay you know scratch off tickets right uh you know little lottery tickets whatever right my my my kid my son loves that we get him every once in a while five bucks worth and scratch him off right and so it kind of hit me a number of years ago like that whole Act of scratching something off is a very fun thing it's one of the few like cheap mysteries in the world like like for a buck you can like you don't know what's going to happen it's very rare to find that these days so I I like this idea of scratching something off so I thought that you could make an app okay that is basically actually let me step back for a second I don't like ads and I don't like ads typically because they tend to be in the way they're always like in the way of what you actually want but I'm like well what if what if you can make an ad that is the product what if ads could be the product like how could you get people to look at these things as as if that's the only thing they're there for um now great advertising is one thing but you know that there are very few great ads so anyway here's the idea every day let's say at noon uh GMT this would be a global phenomenon perhaps it could be geolocated there could be different things in different places but the idea would be once a day you load up this app anytime you want during the day but it only resets once a day and there's ad so you load it up and there's a full screen ad like a tastefully done full screen ad could be video probably still just a start and it's sort of printed on this sort of gray substrate like a scratch off ticket right and you have to scratch it off you know with with your finger you got to scratch off the screen with your finger and the whole thing has to be scratched off before the next thing happens now what would be fun is the scratch off part like whenever you scratch off a real ticket there's always like these little remant of like crumbs of of the Silvery powdery whatever it is so I thought it'd be fun that you have to go like this into your microphone uh basically it would pick up the sound and it would like blow off the dust so you'd have to scratch it off and then go and this would be a thing like everybody in the world could do once a day right once you do that once it's all gone um there would be some sort of a pause and there would either be a coupon for the company that sponsored the ad or there'd be nothing just like when you scratch off a ticket like the chances the odds are very low but sometimes you get a free ticket sometimes you get a buck off a dollar$ three whatever it would be the company would decide what they would give to a maximum of five% of the people who who used it so this has to remain a long shot and a bit of a mystery and a bit of a I don't know what's going to happen today but um and you only get to do it once a day but I think you could get you could build something as simp as that and that would like kind of be it now you could have special interests you could have geographical things so in the United States you get a certain ad if you're somewhere else you get a different ad if you're into bikes you could get just bike advertisers like there's a whole bunch of things you could do here but it would be like in my opinion the simplest possible way to get the most people to look at one thing a day because they might get something behind the scenes and it's kind of also a fun mystery and the ad is the product and the blowing into the thing is sort of a fun thing and like that is it now I think this could be huge actually I think a lot of people would do it I think it could be like an international phenomenon kind of thing because it's so stupid and simple and like why not sh don't tell anyone but I've got 30 plus startup ideas that could make you millions and I'm giving them away for free these aren't just random guesses they're validated cont Concepts from entrepreneurs who built hundred million plus businesses I've compiled them into a one simple database compiled from hundreds of conversations I've had on my podcast but the main thing is most of these ideas don't need a single investor some cost nothing to start I'm pretty much handing you a cheat sheet the idea bank is your startup shortcut just click click below to get access your next cash flowing business is waiting for you I don't know what the legal implications are of doing a scratch offy kind of thing but I like this idea that the phone it's like it has all the the elements it's it's touch screen you can move your finger you can blow into it and then it's a full screen ad and there's maybe something like a prize behind it um again I kind of don't want this to exist because I just don't like the idea of of like selling ads yeah but I think someone who didn't mind that could make this into something quite big and and interesting and uh and there's probably a lot of other things you could do with it so that's my that's my idea well Jason you came on the wrong pod to share an idea because these people will eat up this idea you're all of a sudden there's going to be like 25 seed funded startup Founders who are just going to go after this I mean think about if I'm making things up a 100 million people launch this app every day like I could totally imagine that happening because there's nothing to do but scratch something off and see if you want something so you could see this becoming this massive way to get people all to focus on their phone on this one ad um for you know 25 30 seconds a day um every day and you can imagine the ad inventory you could have and and how it could line up people could buy certain days that were special days that are like you could just imagine a whole ad sales team back back filling this with with with tons and tons of inventory so I think it could make a ton of money and literally there'd be almost nothing to do to make this thing happen except getting the word out and I think the word would spread so rapidly um and all I'm asking for is 1% that's all that's all you're that's all you're asking for just just Loop me in somehow somehow yeah but any what do you think of this so do you remember HQ trivia yes I do yes I do yes so Russ who's the founder of of HQ trivia he's a good friend of mine is a genius um and you know he was the co-founder of Vine before which essentially was Tik Tok he was like the host of of trivia as well right he was never the host he was the product you know co-founder and CEO uh the host was a guy named Scott rowski I think okay okay but I know what you're talking about I know I know the thing yeah what was brilliant about HQ trivia so the fact that to your point it happened at the same time every day people felt like they were a part of something bigger than themselves the commitment was pretty low like it didn't take very long you can do it with your friends and there was a variable reward to your point around maybe I can actually win whatever it is they're giving away I think what you're saying in a lot of a lot of ways is you're taking a lot of the mechanics that well like you know it actually came from to your yeah it actually came from scratch offs but that comes also from HQ trivia and you're applying it to a game um where the advertiser like the problem with HQ trivia was if you remember it was like first they're giving away 10,000 then 100,000 then a million they're raising ventor Capital to like subsidize it you're saying no no don't raise ventor Capital to subsidize it you're saying get advertisers yeah you don't need to have any cash you're not you're not there couldn't there wouldn't be any cash prizes there'd be some I think you could have all these creative prizes from The Advertiser who's advertising so it could be a coupon off it could I don't know what it could be there could be things they have to be very creative I'd love to see it be very creative but the advertiser who's going to get 100 million people or more to look at their ad for like you have to start with a full screen ad and you have to get rid of it um which is also kind of a a weird thing but like they are responsible for the prize for the distribution of the prize uh there is no like money to be given away and whoever would make this app would just be selling the ads basically and then they'd be in charge of getting more people to look at this every day um and the other thing I thought of would be your odds because I like I I like this this this idea and HQ trivia did this and I TV used to live TV used to do this which is like I I like that there'd be a schedule and that something would happen and you could imagine the whole planet stretching here but like picking up their phone at the same time doing this so my sense would be it'd be interesting to have time be a function of of um probability of winning so the closer you do it to the moment it goes live the higher the chance of you winning perhaps or something so if you do it at 7 p.m and it's let's say it goes up at noon you can imagine everyone kind of doing it at noon because like maybe their chances maybe they have a 3% better chance of winning or something like that the further off you go the less chance that that you have just to create this this moment uh for everybody across the world at the same time um to do this thing together there's another idea that my friend Scott Hyman do you know Scott Hyman very well s of meet up yeah very well so Scott and I talked about this idea a different idea but similar years and years and years and years ago which we talked about building which we didn't which is similar not to this ad thing but to this this scheduled uh internet experience thing which was um every day let's pick again pick noon GMT you'd go to a web page um now we had some weird ideas I'll share those in a minute but to make this weirder but let me the premise was everyone would go to the same web page and a video would play and it'd be a a video that would teach you how to do something it could be like candl making um uh how to sketch a room in proportion it could be a quick recipe it'd be a 3 minute Max video it would be on YouTube or or it wouldn't be on YouTube actually it wouldn't be on YouTube it would just be in this platform okay people could submit these and we'd have this ad this admin in the background going yeah that's a good idea no that's really well done whatever we'd have this big big thing it would play for three minutes and when you showed up it would start playing and it would play for from wherever you jumped in like live TV and then like if you came in 40 seconds later you're not seeing the beginning and there's no rewinding and there's no archive there's no way to look at this later if you missed it you missed it it's over you show up at the same time we serve this video out in real time and then it's over and then the remaining 24 or 23 hours and 57 minutes of the day there's basically an ad and some brand could buy the ad at that URL for the whole day they could have a whole website they could do a whole thing could be an entire website not just like a static ad but this idea again everyone shows up at the same time to learn something new together maybe you already know how to do it but it'd be kind of this fun thing and the rest of it's an ad but the weirder thing was we were going to say what if you did this at a new URL every single day and you you'd see the URL in different places and it' be sort of a mystery in a game and like an underground thing to figure out if you can find out where the URL is going to be for tomorrow's show essentially we thought that would be kind of fun anyway didn't do that either but it's the same kind of like having fun with with real time uh making a little bit of a mystery a little bit of a treasure hunt uh and not really knowing what's going to happen so I like that kind of stuff one of the things that you're saying which I think is really the future of the internet is adding opening hours and closed hours to apps yeah that's basically what you're saying so it's funny because when you know in the real world you know you can't go to your grocery store at 2:30 in the morning um it's closed um or you can go to your favorite breakfast restaurant at 900 p.m. it's closed but on the internet everything is so readily available and it's it's funny because I was talking to my wife last night we recently got like linear television you know we I don't know what that is like television we got like Cable cable TV cable got it yeah uhuh like things are on right now are on yes yeah things are on and I was talking to my wife and I was like wow this is amazing and she's like why is this amazing as I'm like you know I just put on Comedy Central I think it was and I was like because I don't need to do anything we're not going onto Netflix and then trying to like figure out oh within Netflix what do I need to watch making all the decisions so I think what you're saying is really interesting which is you kind of have to be there you kind of have to be there it's like a a great comedy show you're like oh you had to be there you know because it's all in the delivery there's something about that moment tied to that would be neat to have I mean this is a stupid Pro again another stupid idea but there's some there's something in it that I like which is speaking about your point about TV it'd be cool if there was a TV that you could buy maybe not cool it'd be dumb but let's imagine there's a TV you could buy that just had an on andof switch and no channels at all it just picked a random Channel every time you turned it on or off or on I should say so you turn on turn it off turn it on new channel turn it off turn on new channel you don't know what you're going to get but there's one button it's on or off each time it just serves up whatever the hell it wants in real time like it's a real legitimate cable channel but you don't know if it's going to be History Channel or some local public access or sports or whatever whatever it's going to be it's just going to be what it is and um I think that while these are obviously Novelties and not like that interesting there's something in that in itself would be like people wouldn't really use that it it'd be sort of again a novelty like a kind of a gag interesting Sideshow but given that everything is on demand everything's available to you all the time it'd be interesting I think um for there to be a few things on the internet um that are not that way that are right now only now not archived not saved if you miss it you miss it I like that I think that's kind of fun and there's probably a lot of other ideas that we could you know play with around that general idea and free you know and it's a free app right totally free this would be totally free I mean be the whole thing would be launch the app ad scratch it off blow it off right do you win or not don't know tomorrow I'll try again like free obviously um but I think it could be one of those things that just takes off it just has a virality to it that's um irritates me actually but but anyway may maybe something like this even exists I don't even know uh but I feel like if the right people did it the right way it could could definitely take off right well I think it's you have to channel your inner inner Russ you know right you either need to be Russ or you need to channel your inner inner Russ so what's Russ doing right now is Russ available honestly proba Pro probably he has like an incredible house you know and in like nature and he he he work you know he's got a few things going on but I think that for the right idea come out of hiding come hibernation he would he would come he's he's brilliant um I've got another idea okay here we go we got no no Jason please this is just opening up so I started on this idea a number of years ago never I got somewhere and then just didn't go anywhere I love drawing in the shower on a shower door or a glass uh shower door steam creates the shower or creates the what's interesting about drawing on a shower is that you're removing again it's like I like this idea of removing versus adding you know removing the scratch thing so you're you're drawing and and removing the Steam and I draw interfaces all the time on shower doors that's where a lot of my like product interface ideas come from I I I play up with it on the door and the reason I like it is because it's so ephemeral that you you sketch this thing and then 45 seconds later the steam cover it's gone it's like it's not there anymore so it's like this Perpetual idea board where I don't have to erase anything it doesn't matter there's nothing that's that it's um precious about it it's just temporary just like the shower I'm not in there that long 10 minutes 15 minutes whatever screwing around like great so I'm like how can i s but but there's something about the white noise and the the the temp the the temporal or temporary nature of it that that I like and the removal so had this idea to basically have an iPad app um you launch it steamy shower immediately just steams up okay it doesn't launch steamed up it launches clear and then steams up within a second or two to kind of have the effect if you put on headphones you're going to hear shower noise so you're going to hear like water you don't have to have headphones you don't have to use the audio part but if you do you're you're in the shower very relaxing and you just draw and it fogs back up perhaps now I I wouldn't V1 would be that's it you're done if you like something you drew take a screenshot there's no like save it's just that's it it's a Perpetual refreshing sketchboard basically uh made of fake steam now you could imagine there's a setting somewhere where you could change the the you know the steam uh resteam duration or whatever but no don't want any of that I love like what's the simplest possible version of this load it up steam draw goes away you're done like it screenshot It Whatever put on headphones there's sound if you don't there's no sound maybe there's sound without headphones I think it'd be cool though if it only worked with headphones like you it wouldn't just play through the speaker I don't know if that's even possible but it'd be kind of interesting to really have to feel like you're really in it so that's another idea again based on these like the simplest possible version of something is always really interesting and entertaining the reason I started building this with someone i' hired an iOS Developer and frankly I'd like to still do this so if someone out there wants to do this with me let's do it I'd like to do it the the thing we ran into was simulating it it has to be good the steam part and the feel of running your finger over it and sometimes you get a few drips and sometimes you don't like I want that to be so realistic and I feel like I need to work with someone who like knows how to render stuff realistically in that way um and um person's working with she was great but like it just it we didn't really get far enough and that was it just kind of faded away but I'd love to do this I'd love to do this because I want this to exist in the world it'd be free again um I'd like shower door I don't know what the hell we call it um shower sketch Ste steam steam wand I don't know what it would be but but but that's what it would be so if if you're out there and you want to do this show me that you can somehow I was going to say that's what I was going to say like I don't want a bunch of emails from people like because that happens you have to be world class at this um but I yeah sorry go ahead no I was just going to say you have to be this needs to be a problem that you a inherently understand and you you could you can picture it and you have the skill set to and have ideally done something similar before um so that you're not spending a year trying to figure this out yeah there's like so little to it but there's a lot to it the app does like nothing basically but the the the the nothing that it does needs to be just so right to feel as natural as it would to really draw on a steamy shower door I know someone could pull this off I'd love to support it and make it happen uh I would use it all the time one of the things that bugs me about sketching apps is how permanent they are I know you can delete and the whole thing but like there's just tools there's tools everywhere I I don't want any of that I just want a surface and I want to go away and if I like what I did I'll save it with a screenshot that's enough yeah what I'm what I'm picking up on well actually before I say what I'm picking up on what you're describing to me is what I call the Margarita Pizza problem which is a margarita pizza of course it's so simple it's just dough and tomato sauce and cheese but you know the difference between the best margarita slice you've had and Domino's Pizza not not hating on dominoes because Domino you know has its place in in society as well but um you know it's not like you're eating a slice and Naples um so that's what you're saying with with your product like it needs to be Naples not dominoes and by the way in the comment section I know what we're going to get people saying oh why you why you talking smack about Domino's Pizza like domino Domino's the right time is is the perfect choice there you go um as as this thing would be the perfect thing to reach for when when you want to be in that mode you know and there'll be many times when I I would use a sketching app for other reasons you know so this is all about the Domino's moment the the the shower dorm moment um this idea at least you know uh but yeah I think it I think it's it's actually surprisingly hard to pull off well quick ad break let me tell you about a business I invested in it's called boring marketing.com so a few years ago I met this group of people that were some of the best SEO experts in the world they were behind getting some of the biggest compan companies found on Google and the secret sauce is they've got a set of technology and AI that could help you out rank your competition so for my own businesses I wanted that I didn't want to have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I didn't want to depend on ads to drive customers to my businesses I wanted to rank high in Google that's why I like SEO and that's why I use boring marketing.com and that's why I invested in it they're so confident in their approach that they offer a 30-day Sprint with 100% money back guarantee who does that nowadays so check it out highly recommend boring marketing.com that's what we realized as we got into it and part of it is um even just the the the finger dynamics of like there's something so in in the analog world things do what they do like you put your fingertip on something and it's the the drawing is going to be the same exact thickness as your fingertip because that's it's analog it's your fingertip that's literally removing so whatever your contact point if you press harder it's thicker if you press lighter it's less right if you use your fingernail uh you can get a thinner line like there there's there's and we couldn't quite get there with the touchscreen Dynamics at the time maybe we didn't know how maybe we weren't able to maybe that's this has been a number of years now maybe it's changed but it'd be really nice to have pressure sensitivity and have it really truly detect the outline of your finger and make sure that that would make the the removal of the steam precisely that much so so there's just no uncanny valley here it's like it is be it behaves exactly as the real thing would if anyone out there goes I love that kind of thing and I know I can absolutely do that please reach out maybe I'll regret saying that but I'd love I'd really love to see this work yeah how much do you think about marketing when you think about an idea how much do you think about about how am I going to get the first 100,000 people to download this uh I don't think about that at all for me it's like um is the idea any good I don't I think it is do I I don't know let's build something and see and then it's like a a Goosebumps feeling like I think we're on to something that that to me is the best feeling in product development it's the feeling of I think we're on to something here we're working on a current product right now which I I can't share many details about but um we just played with an idea it's so hard to be so abstract here but we we play with an idea around images that in this category of product this is not an invention of a new category it's an existing category but in this category images are not typically part of the vernacular we found a way to make images like first class citizens in this category and it's super unusual and weird but like when you do it you go oh we're there's we're on to something here there's something here that that's what I think about is finding those there's something here moments and then I always feel like I've managed to build up a large audience on some on Twitter and Linkedin let's say and and and maybe a few other places I feel like I can get the word out and I feel like if it's any good other people will then get the word out so my my interest is not in how do I Market this it's how do I make this really good that it will Market itself as best it can not everything can do that some things Spike and then die you know so you have to have some sort of something that's going to carry it over the long term and and these kind of ideas I think that the the scratch off one I think could carry it itself because it's one of those things like people would tell other people about and there there might be some other ways to make it more viral like hey if you tell someone else about this we're going to increase your odds by you know 1% like there's a million ways you could game that which is again why I kind of don't like it it's like pure gaming in a sense it's like pushing every gaming lever button switch you could and I'm sure you could do that the the um the shower door thing is more like it' be a very Niche super Niche thing I don't care if 600 people use it I don't care if 18 people use it I want it I'd be happy if I'm the only one who finds it interesting at all um and so I don't really care about that you know that's like a personal passion project for me that actually just got me thinking of a whole other idea which is what do you got okay what if there were limited limited edition apps so just like how there's vintage cars and there's only like a thousand of this one model of Porsche let's say this shower app could be like one of a thousand and it just could be an expensive app you know what's funny um I think someone tried to do this though years ago it was like a fart app that was like a thousand bucks or something and apple and it was like that that was the novelty you know and apple like said no you you can't charge a thousand bucks for this or something like that but I do I don't know um I know with with test flight I think you can of course limit the number of downloads or however that works but I don't think you can do that with the App Store in general so I don't know how you do that but I like I like this idea um and there's things you could say well you'd have to enter a code but Apple would not allow you there's a lot of things Apple wouldn't let you do there maybe on Android you could do that um I like I like the spirit of that people aren't on Android realistically like the person you know I I think it h it would have to be iOS I mean some some apps are just going to naturally be limited by their demand it's like right most people go like I'm not what a sketch thing that's like Steam and I can't save anything and goes away like what that's like so that might naturally you know maybe there are 900 people in the world who find that interesting but no I like I like the idea of um I mean it's kind of what we've been talking about at a different level which is this idea of um limits like the real time limit like you're either there when it happens you had to be there or it didn't happen yes uh and this would be you know you either got it I mean one thing you could do actually um you can put something in the App Store I believe and then discontinue it uh and then it would just stay on people's phones I don't think that it's deleted I know we I think almost certainly that's how that works unless Apple's changed those rules but I think there was a time when that was true uh maybe it's still true so you could like dis this is how uh like high-end watch brands um create a collector's Market they'll make a limited number of watches it won't necessarily be a limited edition sometimes there are limited editions there's many of those but like pect Philipe for example will make a watch for six years or for four years and then just discontinue it so it wasn't it wasn't like we're going to make a thousand and dis it's like we're going to make this and we're going to decide at some point that there's enough out there and we're going to support the collector Community by making sure that this will never be made again and then will hold value or whatever so you could just discontinue things not go into them with limited edition ideas but just discontinue when you're done go enough people have grabbed this enough people have downloaded this we're done um it'd be cool though if there was like some sort of secondhand Mark trading Market for for apps you can't get anymore totally I don't know how that would work I don't think you could do that but um there's some fun stuff in there in 201 14 or 15 we had a really popular app but it got Acquired and got shut down it was this video discovery app uh it was called five by and it was shut down and our team this is around the time when Flappy Bird was really popular so we we skinned Flappy Bird so that when you open up the 5 by app post it closing down it it turned into Flappy Bird but with our logos and our branding and yeah so you didn't have to download a new version of the app it just wow and and people like Ryan Hoover and all these people were going into the app and Ryan wrote like a whole blog post about it yeah um and and it was so funny like it went viral like millions of people you know millions of impressions people were trying to get their hold on apps there's something here and I think like the genius of everything you're saying like to summarize is the real world has a lot of ideas for how to develop a product that's going to work because you mentioned time you mention um like surprise treasure hunts you know a lot of the stuff you're saying ephemerality a lot of the stuff you're saying is hey this is happening in the real world and I wonder if this could happen in software yeah I I think there's uh I mean it's you might say like well it happens in it's happening in the real world that's great the internet's different or software is different why it shouldn't happen here it's not like fit to happen here but I think I think there's I think there's some sort of deeper Universal things to tap into here like mystery surprise uncertainty um uh moments like this is happening in this moment and then it's not happening anymore this this is what makes things valuable in a lot of ways like that that they're not always on demand that like you know you go somewhere and then you leave and like you're not there anymore and they could only experience the thing when you were there you can take a video and pictures but you know they're never the same they remind you to some degree but you can never really be there it's like it's like being you know I don't know the Grand Canyon like there is no photograph that actually represents the Grand Canyon every photograph the best photograph is purely an abstraction um because when you're there there the the volume the size the the the the um the scope of the thing leaves an impression that is impossible to capture in pixels it just you cannot and there's other things like that I mean like love is like that like there's all these other things that where these are feelings that can't be captured and that's kind of partially what makes them really really special uh and um you can't we're not I'm not suggesting that we that you can do that necessarily digit but there's there's some variations of that that I think would be fun to play with and I'd also just like to see and this is not fair because there there are there's plenty of like fun software but a lot of the a lot of it is the software industry is too serious it takes itself too seriously and I just would like to see some more people playing with software playing with ideas in these ways not like creating games games are fun obviously but not about the game mechanics so much but just like conceptual ideas uh like the like the the um shower door stuff is like more about playing with something it's it's it's it's an idea that you're trying to simulate that's sort of not like a flight simulator where it's like you're trying to do something very complicated in a sense but just trying to actually simulate something very simple um I don't know maybe there are plenty of things like that there might be just like even sound apps or something that just like recreates the sound of nature these things exist whatever so it's not like I'm I'm I'm not saying anything super novel here but I'd like to see more of those kinds of things out there in the world what have you seen recently of a piece of software that has had a little bit of fun that you're like whoa these people they're on you know this is interesting like have you had a lot of you know is software boring now or or or or are you seeing stuff that's exciting you I'm trying to find an app um I think I may have deleted it there's some company um maybe you'll know who who they are they make like timers and like really fun typographical things that are like super simple things that just look really fun and look really cool I can't remember what they're called now um there's also there's some company called like something so gosh like it was like simple software or like unnecessary I forget what the name of the company was but they're making really cool apps that really are just like you already have a timer but this timer is like more fun you know that kind of thing you know to be honest I I think um this is maybe not where you're going with the question but but um we recently bought um we actually traded so we had a Jeep Wrangler and we traded for a a Land Rover and so I had a very traditional experience at a car dealership which was like a bad experience it's like four hours of sitting around and paperwork and going to the finance office and it's like there was nothing fun about that except getting the car was fun but the rest of it was just bad experience and then we we recently just traded um we had an Audi rron which we're trading for Tesla that experience has been fun and actually it's there are few very very few things in this world I think that are truly like night and day within the same industry I don't know if you've bought a Tesla or been through the experience but it is a night and day fundamentally different experience you do everything through your phone it's actually fun and interesting to see like where you're at when your car is going to be delivered and you don't really know and they give you a date and then you fill out some more stuff and someone texts you and there's excitement like it's actually a fun thing and there's no paperwork It's All Digital it's super simple uh there's no like Finance guy trying to sell you you know the upsells and the wheel entire pack it's like it's just actually like a fun experience and it's not like the software is fun but the experience is actually fun especially in contrast to what else exists this is something that I I really admire about them and something we've tried to do in our products is to try to make them feel cozy and comfortable in a way that I find a lot of software to be very clinical and cold especially like modern design Aesthetics a lot of stuff just feels very cold and clinical um so I think you can bring a little bit of like this feels warm so it's not necessarily fun but there's a warmth to it which I think is is cool to see um there was that one app or that one game years ago maybe it still exists it's like that sort of skiing game where you kind of hold your finger down and you yep I forget what it's called beautiful absolutely beautiful simple artfully done the whole thing is just was so wonderful and maybe still is that's one of the last experiences I've had using software and this is a number of years ago where I felt like one person made this just to Delight people anyway I'd love to see more of that and less like how big could this be and you know yada y y even though the idea I was sharing earlier I feel it could be big and gamed and the whole thing but um I think it says something that we can't come up with like a hundred apps quickly you know both you and I create software uh involved in software I've been in in it for a while but we can't off the top of our head be like here's the 20 different things you know I think it's it's it feels like I'll say this it feels like this idea of cozy software that you're talking about feels like one in one in 100 not 50 and 100 you know most software feels a bit boring right now I think boring is a good word for a lot of stuff actually and it's unfortunate like you have these incredible little hand computers and or or laptops whatever like whatever is what I feel like is missing and again this is maybe like the the old guy coming back and talking about how it used to be right I don't want to be that but there does seem to be a um a hobbyist ethos which seems to be missing in a lot of software it used to be more of the hobbyist like almost surprising themselves with the fact that they made something that works I was like awesome and it's in that that this thing works this is great like it's totally quirky and weird and I made it for myself and maybe you can use it Vibe which was like the vibe uh like share wear and all the stuff that happened before the internet um and early days the internet too um and early websites and early personal blogs like that kind of stuff there was a there was definitely an era of hobbyists fun exploration we don't know what this thing is yet and I think what ends up happening is that as as you begin to understand what something is some of that fun leaks out of the bottom it's just like you you know it too well now and you it's it there's less of um an explorers mentality it'd probably be like if you were to go go to a piece of land in the mountains that you've never been to the first time is like wow you go back three or four more times there's more wow because you discover new parts to it but if you've been back 15 20 30 times you know it too well now and there's no more surprises left I mean there could be a like an owl could fly by or some like you know whatever there could be other things but but you're you go there with a sense of like I know this now and because I know this I'm not expecting to be surprised there's that awe is sort of missing and I and I feel like the software industry is sort of in some ways become that um and I would say you know in our minds at 37 signals we're actually we've been pretty conscious of this lately last few months specifically actually been talking about this more internally and we're trying to make some really sort of weirder things um so um I'd like to see more weird in software again yeah let's let's make the internet weird again yeah or let's make the internet weird period not even an again you know yeah it's funny like when you run into the yeah true it doesn't need to be again it can just be I mean it is weird like there of course are Corners where it's like super Weir I saw um a link yesterday someone sent me I don't know like I think I saw it on um Jason cocky's blog or something um which is there's a website that you can only visit once oh I like of course you can clear your cookies and like right but but basically you can't it sort of sets a cookie it's like you've already seen this um and and I I think that's kind of interesting you know again like it's not commercial who cares like enough with the everything has to be an asset like everything's become an asset class versus like just it's quirky and weird so I I like that idea like you visit a website once or you again the website only works for three minutes a day or or that kind of stuff I'd love to see more that and I'm sure there's a lot of that in in the edges of the internet uh but um it'd be neat to have more people run into that so doesn't have to be so super esoteric and only a handful of people maybe so yeah absolutely yeah Jason I know what I'm doing this weekend making things weird making things weird I'm making things weird I I this is uh inspired me to to look through to yeah just to to put out some weirder stuff and see what happens I love this idea around effem morality and time-based apps I think the idea I actually really love your uh your scratch off idea and the blowing you know that blowing idea on top of it come on that was awesome that's the extra Spirit of it that I think's important also I'm actually been surprised frankly um that there's not more done in that way I think there's of course there's like you you know um motion sensing and you know and game controllers there's some of that but like blow blowing into it or shaking it or like tapping it in a way that I I don't know like what I don't know enough about what's possible but I know certainly you can pick up audio on the microphone and and you could probably pick up decibel levels perhaps so like a harder blow would blow things harder that that kind of thing I'd like to see some more experimentation there it'd be really fun uh to see that so yeah please make some stuff and if anyone wants to make any of this stuff and like you really want to do it let me know you you don't need my permission by the way obviously these are ideas we're sharing openly here but um I'm going I'm going to call these guys out cuz I'm actually going for dinner at the co-founders house in a few hours there is a fun software studio in Paris that are called ammo Amo and Amo and they will put on YouTube what their apps are but they have some motion apps it's a it's I don't know if you remember this app called zeny it was like a location based tracker kind of like a find your friends but you can like send stickers and there was messaging on top of it they sold to Snapchat for like two 250 $300 million and now they've gone in same team basically have gone and created a social Studio where they they're iterating on three or four social apps and a lot of them one is like a photo app that as you move it you can the photo is different and you can see you know different parts of it that's cool and they're pushing the edge on a bunch of different things there and they've also recreated their zenly app um and it's starting to get traction so I think um yeah I guess it's coming out of Paris it's coming out of probably you know these things exist there is some weird stuff it's just at the edges absolutely and one of the mistake you don't ever want to make is like making this mistake that if I don't know it it doesn't exist like that's such an EG centered way of looking at the world like all I know is what I know there's so much more I don't know so many of these ideas we might be talking about someone else is sitting there in the another corner of the world going I already made this don't you know about this there's like a billion people using this thing so all the stuff could already happen and already exists and if it does wonderful I'm so glad to hear it I'd love to hear about what it is I love to be exposed to it um so yeah our own world everyone's world are quite small um so maybe maybe the internet is still very very weird in a lot of ways um and maybe there are all sorts of fun apps and things that we don't know about that would be cool to explore but I have not seen the shower door app I want to make that and I and um and the scratch off thing would be fun to do I just don't want to build a sales team it's like not my not my thing totally Jason where could people learn more about 37 signals and and and and you well you can go to 37 signals.com that's the number 37 signals.com basecamp.com hey.com our products we make once is another thing we're doing now on c.com which is another like kind of playful idea maybe uh in software these days and then um I'm mostly on um on Twitter SLX my name Jason free fed or on LinkedIn you can find me there uh that's pretty much it and my email address is public you can find it you can email me um and uh let's see what happens amazing thanks Jason this is great Greg thanks so much this is really fun later [Music]

think about how much of startups in the business world is like proposing ideas even if you don't have the core functionality now you can just make the pretty parts and you can pitch people and send them vzero links like hey imagine this app you know if you're working at a company and you're like hey I think we should add this feature you no longer need to send them an email with text you can send them exactly what you think it will look like and you can illustrate your ideas a lot easier even if you don't want to dive into cursor and repet you can still use vzer to share your ideas

Title: Let’s build a social app with AI in 100 min (v0, Cursor AI, Replit, Claude AI)
Published: 2024-09-06 17:30:06 UTC
Description:
In this episode, I am joined by Riley Brown, a leading AI educator, and Ansh Nanda, an AI coding WHIZ, we built a social app in 100 minutes. Riley and Ansh share their step-by-step process to building an app using tools such as V0, Cursor AI and Replit. Learn how to launch your next startup without needing to know how to code! 

1) The tech stack:
• V0 for UI design
• Cursor for code generation
• [Repl.it](http://repl.it/) for deployment
• Firebase for backend
Total cost: ~$20/month vs. hundreds per hour for a developer 

2) Key insight: AI-assisted development is about PERSISTENCE
•  "You will your way to a working app. It's guaranteed." - Riley
•  High-agency devs push through errors. Low-agency give up.

3) The process:
1. Design UI in V0
2. Describe features to Cursor AI
3. Copy-paste errors for troubleshooting
4. Iterate until it works
•  Pro tip: Use screenshots to guide AI for specific designs

4) We built a "Startup Idea Community" app live:
• User auth
• AI-generated startup steps
• Commenting & rating system
• Profile pictures
All in under 2 hours! 

5)  Future of coding:
• No deep technical knowledge needed
• Focus on problem-solving & creativity
• AI handles the heavy lifting
• "You're kind of just guiding it. You're telling it what you want." - Riley

like I've noticed a lot of people under a lot of like commenting on a lot of videos saying like oh I'm going to wait another year so it gets till it gets even easier and I just think there's a massive opportunity right now Greg as you said to create an agency and doing it when it's hard is better because by the time the creating what we're doing now gets easy the people who start now are going to be creating even better sites by then and like because there's a group of people always pushing the edges of all these new things right now there's not very many people pushing the edges of AI websites which is where you will find probably the most profitable Industries or interesting niches to get into and so that would be my advice to anyone who's like oh I'm going to wait for this to get a little bit [Music] easier okay I don't want to waste one second what are we doing today uh yeah so last time we made a very simple app and as you know I struggled through but eventually pulled through making the app and um and since I even added some more features and I might even release it as a product but we thought we could do significantly better uh with this episode and accomplish a lot more especially with two people there's a lot less pressure like when you have someone to talk and someone to build it's a very it's a very nerve-wracking thing you're like all right I'm on a podcast but I'm also making an app it's like how do I act here so we came up with this idea and this this is vzer we used this last time on the podcast and this is just a chat like I think where uh we had Claude generate an idea and we thought it would be cool uh let's say you wanted to create a little Community uh app social app for the startup ideas podcast where people could join create a profile uh and you could type in your startup idea and it'll use AI to generate steps and uh PE other people can rate other people's startup ideas and then add comments and we thought that would be like a really fun Community Building tool and so I threw in the basic concept and I just said uh create the homepage of this app and then I didn't like the initial one right it gave us this right here which looks horrible and then slowly but surely I ideated on it and got it to somewhere where I'm like okay that doesn't look terrible um and then we had some padding issues and ended up with um this one right here and it's pretty clean uh Simple app and we use VZ and I guess there's some few other things maybe that we could add to this homepage that I think would be fun and then um we'll kind of get the general idea for what we want to build and then we'll go into the template and build it sound good that sounds amazing and it's funny because I had a similar idea that I wanted to create um and I asked uh a buddy of mine to create it and he quoted me I think $29,000 to build something like this so oh well we actually we're going to build it in the hour but we charge 29 Grand hour okay yeah yeah yeah okay um but we'll we we'll talk about the details after um um okay so like let's let's talk let's since this is for your startup podcast like um what what type of colors would you want to see in here like let's let's change this up a little bit let's make it fun so the brand of the Pod is is white orange so do you have like a cover photo on your YouTube actually yeah go to uh at Greg Eisenberg let's do Greg Eisenberg and I think if we were to go to your profile maybe just use one of your thumbnails kind of like yeah this one right here okay you see the the orange I'm actually kind of testing a few a few ideas and thumbnails right now I also see if you see the cover photo it's just kind of like these Neons that's a new thing I just just the Subscribe for startup ideas that I just just changed and it's performing really really well um probably like three times the amount of subscribers than I'm I'm used to and I think it's just people love the neon it's just like it's kind of like highlighter so if we could do something with neon that'd be pretty cool okay so um I think maybe like a social app shouldn't be super colorful like I think maybe the background could be white yes and so maybe um let's go back to v0 and this is the published page so anytime you create one of these you can publish this but again let's just go ahead and paste that in let's make sure it's the right image there it is um and we can say can we change and I guess we can can we change the um site that we have here this homepage to match the Styles uh from this image do not look at the specific text or content on this you are only looking at the Styles and let's make the background of the site white and have darker cards or maybe like gray cards with neon text we can just try it out and usually this takes a little bit to load there we go and we can just send it and I would highly advise anyone who wants to just use voice I'm using this tool it's called Talk tastic like talk tastic and it works it gets the job done and it what's cool about it is when Claude starts messing up and I start swearing it actually removes it from what I'm saying so it's kind of good so it keeps our Claude and I on good terms and here we go we're going to kind of watch it build whoa there's your neon that's actually crazy I like it so far hold on please keep going where is it okay yep oh let's do it ah wait why is the text so dark so dark all right what do you think of the background though I like I mean I like the background it's kind of it's it's it's a nice pop of color we can um wait we have to make sure it's done oh whoa I did not see that coming I did not realize it was going to change thoughts I don't know man it feels it feels too much like am I am I looking at a clown right now feels like it's like too Clowny you know what I mean what I liked about the cover photo up top was it was like professional with a few hints of bright colors this just feels too much okay okay so okay this is too much let's say keep keep the background the same but make the cards uh slightly gray let's make the cards gray with dark text but the header is the header text is dark blue and the checkboxes are green the rest should be a more relaxed darker color uh to create a more simple in interface shh don't tell anyone but I've got 30 plus startup ideas that could make you millions and I'm giving them away for free these aren't just random guesses they're validated Concepts from entrepreneurs who built hundred million plus businesses I've compiled them into one simple database compiled from hundreds of conversations I've had on my podcast but the main thing is most of these ideas don't need a single investor some cost nothing to start I'm pretty much handing you a cheat sheet the idea bank is your startup shortcut just click below to get access your next cash flowing business is waiting for you Ane I'm curious any any thoughts here for the The Styling yeah I I I mean I think um we should probably uh just style one component like one card at once and that would be more effective um than the whole page um if we use that yeah fair enough so should we just maybe we'll just focus on the card and we can worry about the background later um say let's just design let's just design one of the cards let's say the current design is too much let's go more conservative and then we'll say keep the background okay so let's just try this on one of the cards and the designs are a lot faster what's really cool about um what an is suggesting here is on v0 you can go component at a time so uh and you can say you can Fork all of these links and I'll show you right after this so after this is done if it ever starts maybe we'll need to retry let's try that and while that's pulling up do you recommend doing it one component at a time is that is that the good best practice uh I I orang could probably speak he's he's probably implemented more designs into full websites uh it is probably easier to add them one at a time based on my limited experience I'm curious an what what you think yeah I think um v0 really excels at uh using your like whatever prompt you give it and making a specific component out of it and you can like visualize your design changes in real time and so I really recommend using VZ to build that like specific component and a component really is like anything you know a button can be a component a card can be a component technically a page is also a component but the smaller you go the more you can iterate and focus on that without overwhelming the context window and that's why I think it's like a lot more effective and you'll move faster because it takes less time to generate the code because it has to generate a full page every iteration then you're going to be like there's going to be like a full 90 seconds in between each change see I personally think this looks very good this clean gray card um it lays out the the ideas and so what you can do here to organize your work what I would do is I would hit publish confirm and publish and then you can um you can either view the whole page right here so we can open up a new window and just paste it in we can see it full screen um and you can also Fork it from this so I would just save this link right here and so this was our original idea and so you could make just like a simple um like components um and then you just go card and then you just paste the link right there and you can keep track of all of your components and then it's easy very easy to find the code because at any anytime you can click on it later and you can say show code and you're going to we're going to want to give this to Claude uh later and so this it's a good way of organizing your your work because and we can also Fork from this right we could Fork this so now this is the only chat that it has so far we can say can you create a um create or uh create a profile um a profile component where the user puts in uh name profile photo oops stop all right well that's all they get no we'll stop that early um name profile photo uh let's say startup interests location and current profession I I don't know we don't need to include all these this is just an example um I probably should have said to create one that's the same style but I think it might just do it anyway and while that's while that's pulling up I noticed that when you went to go and click I think it was share there was an icon for Reddit and why combinator Hacker News why did why like how are people yeah oh oh on X as well like why what do you do there yeah so I guess maybe if you wanted like if we wanted to get really quick uh feedback on it we could very quickly share it to Reddit share it on X I will say it it looks like vzer is like busy like vzer is popping off the last two weeks like their servers must be taking a beating like so many like you think our last video got 500k views we use vzero there's many many other videos also using it so I maybe we cut it some slack um a little bit though I it'll get annoying there we go um but yeah you can very easily change the styling and then share it with other people which which is really cool I just love the fact that you can Fork it and keep everything organized because then you can do all of the planning before you ever go to cursor I know right now we're going to hop directly into cursor after this but I'm telling you and an can speak to this too it's very very very useful to come in with a full plan in mind expect to get stuck a lot more if you come into diddle dle and I I like if you just like oh let's add features as we go it is fun you will you'll have fun and you can just treat it like a for fun type thing but don't expect to like have an organized project at the end and we make this the same style as the card prior um the gray background but other than that I think this looks pretty good gray background and yeah and then after this these two components then we can dive into the template and we'll create this into a site because time is of the essence we have a lot of features we need to add your startup profile okay there you go you have a clean simple simple um simply designed profile component so now we can just hit publish confirm and publish uh copy this link and then now we have the profile component we can just paste that here and we're organized um now let's do the fun stuff let's dig in we have multiple AI feat or yeah we have an AI feature we need to add which is creating the steps to create the startup and so I'll kick it to an and he'll go through the template we just created cool um let me just share my screen here Riley it must be nice that you can just kick it on you know yeah it is it's nice to have I I do want to say I when I first started Ed creating apps with AI um an was one of the people he just like reached out to me and we ended up having a 30-minute conversation and we just like started talking and a few days later I was struggling a lot on a project after and I had hopped on a call with him and he was like helping me with uh using AI features and he I told him I was like dude I think in order for me to do this I think I actually just need to learn to code and he was the person who's just like no I don't think you should I think you should do all of this without ever writing a line of code and I asked him like do you actually think it's possible to become like a good developer without writing a single line of code and he goes it's going to be really really hard but yes and then that's all I needed was one developer someone who who actually knows how to build to just say like it's technically possible because I was worried I was getting in over my head like creating apps without coding and then that's what caused me to just dive in like fully anyway all right let's go let's make let's make some stuff okay so we have a we have this template here that we created R and I and um all we've done is clicked the use template button on on dret they they get to this point here and we've set up um Firebase and um a few other tools Riley do you want to speak about how people can do that if they want to yes so um in our community so senior Swiss so senior software composer there's a tab if you want to open that up really quickly I posted the video there and it I've have three separate videos in there going over the setup what we didn't want to spend the time doing the like every single time you use the template you have to go through this five to 10 minute step if it's the first time you've done it uh it takes about 15 minutes maybe um but in the templates you can see and I wrote out all the steps so you can watch the first five to 10 minutes of that video I go through every step to create Firebase Firebase is free and so it's super easy to get it set up and then you just connect cursor to repet and you're good to go and that's the point that an is at now so we can get into the fun stuff yeah so I did everything here and then I um went to this template here and I clicked use template and that's where we're at so um I'm running this on on replate and I have cursor open here and I've connected those to again those instructions are already in the post that Riley was just mentioning so now we can just jump right into it so the way that we've set up this project um is that we can Implement pretty much any web app that you think about and that's because we're using nextjs and you don't really need to worry about what nextjs is or what it means but it basically means that we can call any apis like open AI or CLA from anthropic or Firebase communicate with database any of that stuff is is possible with this template and um to make it easier for people to get started we've created these Pats and these Pats are a few different apps that we thought might be interesting and we're going to add a lot more these four are just the beginning we're going to add many many many more um and so today we're going to create like a simple social media app for people to share their startup ideas where they can get AI generated steps and how to go about um creating that startup idea so we can honestly just get started from the social media um app path and to get started it's really simple the first prompt so I'm going to open composer on on cursor here where I'm going to click command I and this opens this window right here now this allows us to edit multiple files at once um cursor has two modes um or three modes but uh this is sort of the one that allows you to edit many many files at once and we're going to be mo mainly just using this composer mode and you are all software composers so this is where you're going to be spending a lot of time so I'm going to just make this big and nice um and get started so um all I'm going to tell cursor to do is follow the instructions um in um and uh you can just find the sorry an do you want to zoom in like a click or two okay that's good yeah yeah that's fire okay I can even zoom in more it's fine um yeah so all you have to do is tell cursor to follow the instructions in the social media path and you can reference any file or the whole code base or with just this at symbol and then you can start typing the name of your file and we have this file called social media which is essentially I'll just show it um it's like a it's a prompt um that allows us to get set up with basic functionality like authentication um a home feed liking and commenting for pretty much any any social media app so um I'm just going to St it there follow the instructions in this file exactly create uh the social app as described hey while he while he types that out this is very very similar to what remember when chat gbt added custom gbts and then you could access them via the app sign where like you could just go in the main chat and you could do the at Whimsical diagrams custom GPT and get access to it right away that's exactly what we're doing here we're using the at sign to access notes which are basically in markdown format which provides built-in instructions for cursor that's it it sounds like what we're doing is we're accessing I mean every social media app has Primitives they have posts they have profiles they have likes we're not Reinventing the wheel we're just accessing those Primitives so that we can use it in our app is that right exactly and we've tested them so like we've we've basically created a prompt that creates a social media app and then when we're like okay this prompt really works we add it as a path um basically to make it easier for people to get to a specific starting point yeah so there there are two main value propositions this template offers one is like we've set it up with a bunch of apis to common things that you might want to use like you want to update data on Firebase which is like your database so like if you want to store any user data like um you know Riley just made a profile component uh we might want to save like the name of the user or um the startup ideas that they're interested in all of that would need to be stored somewhere and that's what Firebase is used for as well as images as and logging in with Google um and then we also set up a bunch of other apis like we're going to be using uh the open AI uh chat chat GPT API right now um to generate the steps that you need to take to do your startup idea and we've set that all up a lot of that code is what we like to call Plumbing and it's very similar and it it doesn't it's often times the hardest part for people who are just getting started and that's why we've we've set it all up for you hell yeah let's send it just gonna get this prompt going and yeah the these are actually the most crucial like once you get into the flow like Greg you saw it last time in our last podcast I struggled at the beginning because we hadn't set up our template yet and that was trial and error like in after the podcast it was just me and an basically um testing out like where are we going wrong and then slowly working our way backwards to make it easier for anyone who wants to try and yeah the first prompts are critical so I would put most of your attention and then once you get into the flow and you have the base set up it's a lot easier to make changes to the app and it it becomes more fun once you get to that point for sure and you have a template that people can download and I I bet that there's other templates available like where do people go find these templates I mean there's all types of I encourage people to whenever they create a project that they like to just create a template out of it like you can throw it on GitHub we only did it because we saw such a massive desperation need or a desire for people to like be able to create websites with natural language like it's such an empowering thing and a lot of marketers business people want to do it and so we decided that repet was the easiest one to just like create a temp because a lot of the time you have to create a repo and I've never even done I've never even gone to GitHub I GitHub still scares me so like like I like it I like the word templates a lot easier than repo you know like that's still scary but they're all over the Internet um on you want to yeah so we uh just ran this base prompt and now we've gotten a lot of changes and let's just see what it's done so it's updated a lot of different components it's created a lot of Pages um it says it's implemented authentication navigation user profiles and this is the kind of flow that I like working with with cursor I'll just click save all first and when you click save all the changes should be automatically reflected on ret and you can see we got some errors here that's completely fine you're going to get a lot of Errors you just need to copy them and then paste them right back in that's it that's all um and I I don't like accepting changes until I've reached a point where there are no errors so that's why I'm just going to click save all um and all that does is save the files syns it with ret so you can see the preview live so it said it's done the changes um and I'm click save all again um and let's see let's reload this web view um okay same same thing so you're saying don't get worried that errors are going to come up it's only natural and just keep copying and pasting that's basically it yes when you're starting out when you're just starting out yeah you have to do that but think about it he's pressing save all so at any point he could go and hit reject all which would revert you back to the original state which is fine you get to try again um obviously once become more um I've reached a point where I can actually pinpoint some of the errors that come up and I actually know what the problem is um the more you do it the better you'll get but when you start out yes just copy and paste and save very often so you can go back um that would be my best advice here quick ad break let me tell you about a business I invested in it's called boring marketing.com so a few years ago I met this group of people that were some of the best SEO experts in the world they were behind getting some of the biggest companies found on Google and the secret sauce is they've got a set of technology and AI that could help you outrank your competition so for my own businesses I wanted that I didn't want to have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I didn't want to depend on ads to drive customers to my businesses I wanted to rank high in Google that's why I like SEO and that's why I use boring marketing.com and that's why I invested in it they're so confident in their approach that they offer a 30-day Sprint with 100% money back guarantee who does that nowadays so check it out highly recommend boring marketing.com yeah so we have something running um but there are some more errors um that are coming here um so I'm just going to keep going down this flow for a little bit which by the way is crazy that in like 20 or something minutes you can just like oh we have a social media app ready to go yes uh that was the most addicting feeling I've ever felt like once you feel it and you make something that you have in your brain it's just so addicting it's all I think about sometimes um we're definitely getting more errors than we did when we did a we've done the previous um social media app in the past but this is expected and this is good data for us like okay maybe we need to adjust the prompt in the path next time because there's going to be multiple versions and there's going to be tons of errors and once we've accepted that and we're like all right it's not going to be perfect people are going to get confused let's create a community that's down for errors and confusion like we're in a completely new space at no point in human history have people been able to do this so like let's cut it some slack you have to kind of have that mentality okay cool we are at a point where this is loading um and let's see if we go to create post it says please sign in to create a post so now at this point like I'm not getting more errors and so what I'd want to probably do is just accept these changes um save these changes and then I'd come to um git the git tab here in in ret and I just write a message of the changes that I've made this will just allow you to go back where you were at um if you ever get stuck so um we definitely faced a lot more errors than normal um but that's fine that's like these llms are non-deterministic and they will like be completely different in different situations um and so I mean I all I did was copy paste it like I could read this code and go and fix that error myself and that would probably work just as fine but I could also just copy paste and we've gone to a point where this app is running we have like a really simple home feed with a post that I added previously um but yeah let me just um go change this so homepage working but if I go into profile or um some other page it doesn't really load so I'm just going to say homepage working um sign in not working I can't stress enough how important this step is for if you're just beginning I promise you if you forget to do this you will waste four hours if if you get deep into a project and you don't save you will ruin your time it will ruin a night for you I guarantee it I've done it multiple times where like I'm now yelling at Claude I'm like return it back to how it was because I forgot to save and claude's like I don't know which version you're talking about like and it'll it's huge pain that's all I have to say say less I could I could see the pain in your eyes you you've seen some stuff yeah so now now that we have um a basic version working I'm going to just reset the composer and that's just because I want to focus on different features or different problems that are not part of this context so I can click reset or you can close it and just open a new window um but yeah I'm just going to click reset and then um I don't want any files here if you know how to code you can add which files you think are necessary and I could do that but for this version uh this run through I'm just going to pretend that um you know I'm I'm not looking at the actual code underneath so what do we have here we have a homepage working with a a post um but we don't have profile or create post workking um and when I when we go to this it just tells us to to sign in to view our profile similarly for create post it just says that so um that's what I'm going to tell it home feed with some posts but when I go to profile it do need to sign in profile or yeah and one thing and while an is typing this out um one thing that an told me early on that really helped me was describe what's going on first then tell it specifically what to do you don't want to leave it up to chance there's a lot of times where like he could say my the the profile page isn't working send like it doesn't know how you want it to solve that problem it's like the profile page is not working um it currently looks like this here's a screenshot of the profile you don't have to do it uh but like for example if it's a design thing screenshot it show Claude be like this is what it looks like I don't want it to look like this please make it look look like this it should be blank and like be very specific at the end of your prompt so it knows exactly what to do could I screenshot it draw on it type notes on it yes but you might want to be specific about what your let's say you're like I want it to be a um a header I want it to be a top bar and I want this icon there if you Circle your where you want it to be be like on the image I circled where I want the Prof profile button to be and be specific like explain it like it's an intern um and it will understand you it will get it you just got to be over specific there's a tool I use for screenshots called cleanshot X for mac and it's just super easy to do quick screen grabs and write on it so I'll include uh I'll include a link in the description yeah cool so I did exactly what Riley said right I described what happening now and I described what I want so there are three changes that I want in this these are all pretty small changes and if they're pretty small changes you can ask them in just one prompt but usually if they're larger changes I would just restrict one change to one prompt so I'm click submit every time I do this and and I didn't even press enter I get the the Jitters I don't know if you you guys get the Jitters too they they wear off after a while um I think that's with anything you know with experience comes composure you know like I'm sure Tony Robbins doesn't get the Jitters before he goes and speaks you know no I've seen him live he definitely doesn't yeah if the audience has more Jitters than he does I I forgot to um give it context of the whole code base so I'm just going to copy my prompt reject all the changes um reset the composer and then Bas what I had and just add code base you got distracted when you were um telling people about the specific files so that's the way to address it's definitely good to use at codebase earlier on uh especially because if it doesn't know what files you're talking about it's not going to look at the right thing but we I think an and I share the perspective that context windows are going to get so big that it'll be able to look at oh that's starting to look better I I think future models are going to be able to look at a lot more of your codebase every prompt which is going to be way easier for us cool so now we have a log out button so I can click log out and then I can click log in uh so login is not working we can fix that um but that was my uh account I was showing up previously so I'm just going to ask it um did you did you put the dev domain in Firebase yeah I did I did um I think it didn't create a login page because what it's saying is 404 so you'll pick these things up as you go but like this is something that' be useful so when I click the login button it shows me 44 this page could not be found and anyone who's been on the internet for any amount of time knows that like you know the 404 error is like you know when something not be fanned um and so that's all I told it um so I describe what's going on right now and then I'm going to say um create um allow me to login hey while while an is typing this out another thing you might be a complete beginner and you might not know what to tell it and that's how I started and so if you're in doubt say please create whatever is necessary to address this issue uh because some sometimes you won't even know what to tell it to do uh but the more you get that's part of getting better it's a skill uh and you'll get better at explaining exactly what you want and what you need yeah do you ever ask Cloe and just be like I don't know what's going on here teach me all the time especially when starting out yes like you'll run into errors and I actually I suggest pasting the errors in in the beginning being like okay don't generate any code tell me what's the problem and that you'll increase the your learning rate significantly if you actually try and learn along the way and you just have to ask cursor yeah and maybe even being like teach me and write it in plain English like eighth grade English be clear and concise and write in plain English yeah that's definitely good um I would suggest using cursor's um chat feature so so here if I minimize this composer window you can press command L and you can open chat and then you can literally just ask it codebase um explain this codebase to me in plain English um using a Creator language yeah and this is super useful um to just see it in English so it tells you this is using a technology called nextjs which helps you make websites faster and easier to build there's set up for user accounts using something called Firebase this lets people have their uh sign in have their own profiles this app can do cool things like generate images have conversations with AI use voice notes and this is just all our paths that it's getting that um information from um and now it's giv code but you can also tell let to not give code and and give you a response that way um wait did you just generate okay okay never mind yeah so um I'm here I'm going to save all these changes we will trying to fix the login issues and then um I'm just going to reload the page over here this is like the path that you're at so um like the URL of the website so I like if it's just a slash that just means the homepage so um I'm going to click login and let's see what happens so okay it takes me to log in with Google I can select my email and now it's a log out button so if I click profile I should be able to see my profile it got my name my email it shows me posts um I can create posts um I can select an image um let me see yeah this is an app that R and I created um Voice Text app um and I'll create this post um and yeah they just created that post um I'll reload the page let me see if the images aren't loading but now they're loading yep so this is this pretty much it and we can click like and it shows a like counter um and I can add an comment and it shows a comment um and clearly like this has some issues right there're like two navigation bars for some reason um but like the basic functionality is working and all I did was copy pasted the arrows I could have gone there and like edited the code myself or could have written this whole app myself I've been coding for almost 10 years now but it's still faster for me to just prompt Ai and tell it what to do and get me to a point where I'm here yeah know and and so do we want to next just apply the Styles I I pasted those in that Google doc I sent you uh an if you want to make maybe we can make those cards for the post or do you think we have some more steps before that yeah I think we should just clean it up a little bit I don't think it should take too long so um we can just accept these changes again it's good to accept them whenever you're done I'll reset this composer I'll go to the git tab on duplet and I will add a message for uh login Works um looks kind of weird and these are just for you honestly it doesn't matter if if you're not working in a team um what those messages are but like we' saved our progress so nothing's going to be lost until that point so okay we're here um again I've reset the composer um all these files are open I I don't really need them can just close them all and command shift I to to open the composer right here so I'm just going to make a quick a few quick changes so you're going tell it um and um I have clean shot X too so why don't we try your method Craig so I'll take a screenshot of this whole page it'll be like oh wait you can copy them directly oh wow I'm downloading this wow it's a no-brainer it's a no-brainer what is it called cleanshot X called yeah it's called cleanshot X I think the website's cleanshot dcom oh wait is that the one you said was part of uh set app on set app yeah okay what's that set app is like a suite of tool you can get them individually but you can also like get a membership to set app which gives you access to a bunch of tools or on Mac or something yeah I think Kane cway suggested that to me yeah dozens of apps one subscription 9.99 okay wcl a link in the Des in the YouTube description I love how quickly you can just like apply squares or rectangles and arrows that's super nice yeah and it's it's good for this and it's also just good for sharing anything with a team member especially like when you're dealing with wireframes designs and if everyone's a designer now because of vzero you're G probably need something like this yeah I mean the endgame is like you're going to talk to AI exactly as you would talk to a designer employee um which scares some employees but like also empowers you to create some cool things it's more it's more Hands-On it's better than typing typing is kind of boring yeah so let's see if this works I've actually never um done like this but theoretically it should um I bounded this navigation this extra one with this red box and I basically told it for some reason there are two navigation bars in my app the blue one on top that says home profile create post and log out is correct the one that is bounded should we say to Center the cards um um I think we should do that in the next prompt um okay let's do it just just because it's good to focus on one thing at once you can do multiple things at once you'll just be like expect more errors in that case um so I'm just gonna say this and I noticed you put quotation marks uh around home I sorry profile and and stuff like that is that really important to do no honestly um no you don't to do that but being very very descriptive is really useful so the more specific you can be about what you want the better um so I guess think about it this way right like we gave it the image and it it is a vision model and it's working somehow it's able to figure out like what is going on in the image um but if it's not you can give it other context clues and so the main difference I saw between the top navigation bar the one that we want and the this one the one that we don't want is that the top one is blue and it has four items which say home profile create post and log out and the bottom one is has no color and um just has these three items so I was very specific about the one that I want to keep um and I was very specific about the one that want to remove so let's see if that worked um Okay so give me an error um I'm just going to copy paste that error in here I feel like that's an easy one yeah it's just a font is not available um yeah okay so it did not remove the bar um so let me let me rephrase what I'm trying to do um that did not work so let me see if this even works it does work um but we don't we don't want it to work um the ISS so I'm going to describe it in a different way so the issue is that the home page home feed page has a navigation bar um that is separate um from the other pages I want to remove that one it only has another way to tell it and this comes with time it's like I know this page has all the same cont like it's the home feed page cuz it's we're at home um and only this page has that navigation bar that we don't want as you can see and so if I tell it that it'll know where to look um and then I think the reason it didn't work before is because I didn't give it code base contact so always do that don't don't forget how does this work with mobile like are these web apps responsive in any way like on on the browser they're great um like with the voice app we made last like Works honestly it works better on my iPhone than it does on the web app obvious obviously that will be part of our community we will get there at some point uh developing web apps on cursor which it is possible uh even with just AI it's just a lot more difficult I've heard and you can't use repl it as easily you're going to have to do it locally hey it worked yeah cool yeah now it worked so I I told it where to look and I forgot to give it the code based contact so that's sort of the reason why so again I'll save this accept it and um I'll go here and add my changes removed useless navigation hey let's let's start powering through this I want to get to the point where all three of us make a profile and create our own uh ideas I think that would be really fun Okay cool so let's um you want to uh focus on components maybe we just do the let's get the AI feature working and then do the components do you think that's a better way to do it or do you think the inverse is better um yeah I think that's a better way to do it um Okay cool so so so I was thinking that the user you know like on Facebook you go to create a post right instead of that it's like create a new startup idea and so user uh types in their startup idea in a text field as if it'sit chat gbt and it will generate different steps that you can mark off as complete and you can keep track of everyone's progress towards their startup and then yeah and it allows you to edit each of the individual steps which isn't as straightforward as a normal chat gbt chat because this actually has to plug things into Fields right it's plugging things into steps rather than just giving you a text response but it shouldn't be too difficult yeah so now we're going to describe how we want to change this app so um I want this I want to modify this app to be social media app for startup ideas um or I'm going to be more specific on the create post page I want to um be able to type out my idea and then I want AI to generate the necessary steps to do to to achieve that idea to use then I want to use um open AI API to generate the next steps to achieve the idea and what's fun about this is once you get this down in the basics the the steps might not be that great but like in theory Greg you could take all of your YouTube videos and create like a custom chat gbt assistant and instead of calling the open AI API you can now call all of your startup ideas or all the guests that you've had on your podcast to kind and like you could even be like watch this video here to see he talks about it at this timestamp like it would take a lot more time to like Implement that but like as a retention method for people watching your episode and it would just be more useful probably to see some more context on why that's the right startup step you know 100% all right this is probably the hardest step would you agree an yeah definitely um but it looks like it knows where it's going Oh you mean implementing AI into a software app you know like checks out yeah yeah it's it's so it's hard and my I have done this before and actually this is one of the first projects an and I worked on was generating something like this with paths I was calling them paths at the time and we struggled through it but he like didn't even he purposfully didn't help me he's just like no keep going down this path and he just like he wouldn't like give me the answer okay let's see someone shot at a startup idea uh what was the example I was doing in the last podcast uh selling water balloons at football games in Germany in Germany it was Niche it was niche but it's fine you know uh uh riches in the niches right is that your thing yeah that's what they say Okay um it gave me an error um so let me come back here and say it gave you an error because Riley's idea was painfully bad it's a zero it it evaluates it it just gives you an error it just doesn't work if it's so bad Okay so so we are here um I've saved these changes and I'm going to tell it exactly what happened so when I go to yeah this is actually going to be fun like as soon as we get a a deployed link he can send it to us we can log in upload our startup ideas and we can comment on each others and see it in the home feed I'm curious Greg what were some of the did you see any of the comments uh from the last podcast of like things that people wanted to build or did you notice any Trends from the comments of like what excited people the most yeah a bunch of things one and questions too you know one question that I think was on people's minds is who owns this software meaning if I use vzero and I use repet and I use cursor is this my software or am I just like like what's the deal here it's a good question I to my I don't know the answer if I I don't think that maybe an would be a better like I think we own this like the I don't know actually I have no idea who owns the code like isn't it just like open license I have no idea someone in the comment section who's hopefully a lawyer go check it out we want to know to the bot you know we want to get to the bottom of this because you don't want to create some we don't want to create something and it gets like a million users and then you know one from one of these platforms is like you a bunch of money so worth looking into but I imagine the way it works is you pay for a cursor so you're essentially licensing their software to create something that you own that's how like for example it'sso tuno Ai and a lot of the music companies you own you own that software um because you're licensing it basically right right yeah I I don't I would assume that's how it works um because like when you create something on vs code it's open source so yeah I don't know I think a lot of people just watched the last video and they were like whoa this kind of changes everything you know if creating a minimal viable product now takes a day max I mean we've done we've done it in an hour or two um the hard part is build distribution and then just experiment with a bunch of ideas seawood sticks um yeah and then you can make it prettier later right yeah well yeah you can make it prettier later or uh I mean like think about how much of startups in the business world is like proposing ideas even if you don't have the core functionality now you can just make the pretty parts and you can p people and send them vzero links like hey imagine this app like a lot of you know if you're working at a company and you're like hey I think we should add this feature you no longer need to send them an email with text you can send them exactly what you think it will look like and you just you can immediately share your you can illustrate your ideas a lot easier even if you don't want to dive into cursor and repet you can still use vzer to share your ideas an you want to take us through um one of why we're getting these errors you think yeah so um we're just getting a lot of errors and you can see that the error is being logged here um and I'm going through the same workflow and I think it should figure out the problem I just copy the error you can click this Dev tools button and dret and you can paste that in um and um you know let's see let's see if we're going to be make progress here it seems like it's unable to work with open AI but we let me just check our secrets Tab and make sure that we have the open a API key yes we do um okay um let's see what's going on I'll save all these changes what if you open the the dev tools and it was literally just like that that startup idea sucks it was just in the a loog that would be pretty funny okay so I think we've made some progress um it's it's generating um let's see how long this takes shouldn't be too long right should be like maybe like oh there we go oh wow that's what's up you can sled comments we can still like um and this is a startup idea and like literally I I know how to code I could have gone in the code and edited it but all I did was copy paste the errors that you're getting clicked here saw the whole thing saw the errors and copy pasted them that's it um okay now now an it might be useful now to maybe just use the vzer component as a screenshot because we have those green circles the green check marks in there that I think is going to like tie everything together um to kind of make it look like a clean list of steps and once we get that working then we can adjust the prompt like maybe we make them a little bit shorter um but I think we're getting there we've gotten past I think the hardest part yeah cuz someone in the comment section is going to be like but this app is so ugly no one would use it but true but now we have something that's working and a good foundation and now we're going to go paint the walls and make it look nice yeah I mean on like we started this actual build process 45 minutes ago and an just going slower than we normally go because we're explaining things like if we were to just heads down build this as fast as we can like oh yeah yeah that's so this is vzer this is what we made at the beginning of the podcast and he's just going to snag this you could grab the code as well I don't know if what you think would be the best best way to do this an Yeah in our next version of our template we're going to make it so that you can um basically just um use this code directly and we'll show you how to do that um and make it like make it look exactly like this but for now we're going going to um just copy the code and then I'm going to reset this composer because I'm doing a new um a new feature and I'm going to go back to my dlet and I'm going to be like um okay so I'll describe what we have so um I want the startup idea card which displays the startup idea in the home feed to look like um following code and that's all I'm going to say and I'm going to be like um do not use this code directly purely use it as a reference to style the startup idea component um that display reate saying you're not you're not looking at the the specific text like or content you are just looking at the styling I always I've gotten screwed over when doing this and it takes the actual content literally and it can break the code do not use the um exact content of the code provided um but just the styling I should give it context of the code base so I'm going to um or actually it it was doing a good job I'm just going to get it to um keep going or wait a sec just start it over just copy it it's hard to get it actually I don't got some zoom out like command minus or whatever that's a good idea like I go all the way out and just snag it that is a good tip until cursor fixes this um this is probably the way to go so um again I'm going to give it this context um and give it coas yeah the cursor definitely has like just little minor bugs but I would rather have minor bugs than them not ship new features all the time that are amazing and life-changing and while this is happening why is cursor better than the competition I will definitely not be the best person to I have never used any of the other competition but wait first let's look this looks pretty solid oh yeah that's clean is there any responsiveness to when you touch the or click on the the check marks no there isn't but I don't think that's obvious oh we can still like and unlike we can add comments you guys just want to log into this site and add some startup ideas yeah yeah why don't you are you going to just post the replit link yeah I'll just send this to you and you'll have to eventually explain how to eventually get off of repet onto a custom domain yeah definitely oh yeah we can we can do that right after we do this okay that's the E it's the easiest step once you deploy deploying can be a challenge but replit makes it the easiest of all of them but yeah it's very easy to add a custom domain oh wow yeah I see it on my screen do you see it Greg so interesting I am I I see so the font is in white so I don't see it but I know do you know what I'm talking about mine took me I'm logged in wait did you you copied the whole link uh on just sent yeah yeah I logged in successfully and I just added a startup idea but when you go to create a post and you write within create a post the font is white and so it Blends in so that's just a small visual bug nice but I've just successfully added a startup idea that I've had for a long time which is IMDb for creators so IMDb is obviously a database of Hollywood and celebrities but I don't know if that really exists for creators where's my Riley Brown uh page so I put that in there so each wait would each video get a rating it it would just be like I a just like how IMD oh actually it's a good question I didn't even think of that originally yeah like you know like think about it like if you if every video is rated um then you kind of end up with this um like a you know a cohesive score you know you can look at all of a director's movies that they have individually you know like I see you're trying to do you're trying to do a Rotten Tomatoes for creators like oh yeah yeah yeah yeah which what I'm trying to do is who is Riley Brown give me a little description of it maybe his top content like his top videos what are my musty um I don't need to score you because that's just like a bit weird to score people I don't know how I feel about that um but that's that's the idea I like it did you add an idea Riley I'm doing it right now um only with AI so I I I added a comment to your um to your idea Greg oh this is a dope idea yeah wow someone has said someone from the internet I don't know where who how but someone has commented that they like my idea they think it's a dope idea and so we we just got from like nothing to this AI generated startup idea social media app in wait refresh the page and check the comment okay uh yeah this will not get funded someone else who's Anonymous said this will not get funded um and they added a new startup IDE by the way I kind of love it's like a feature not a bug that people are Anonymous like it makes it a little more fun and spicy well and and maybe it's a feature that you can't see what you're typing and you just got to send it I'm that's why I made some typos in there um should we fix the input box an maybe yeah I mean it's it's fine for me so I'm not sure what the issue is but um let me just I can assume that it's probably something to do with dark mode but yeah let's Del Cloud that um I'm just going to save my changes here so but think about it think about what we've done already like realistically we've only been working on this for an hour we started 20 minutes in we were just doing design stuff so after one hour we have a full social media like app and it's like a community based social media app you could have all of your community use it right now you can put in your startup idea and it will generate all the steps or at least an outline of the steps that you need to take we can all sign in we all logged in we can like and comment on each one and I think that's pretty sick yeah sick I remember back in in the day just doing Google login would take months to add to a a website now it's one prompt with the template but yeah okay let me save these changes and let's see create post uh can can you guys check if it's been fixed for you so should we refresh our page yeah just refresh the page yes it's fixed okay also the background of the site is black for me like yeah when I'm when I'm viewing it the content is white so like the center row is white or the center column like where the cont is but everything around that is black yeah so it's probably because dark mode light mode so if you change your computer to be in light mode it'll probably fix it like here let me just try it right now so if I put my computer on wouldn't it be more effective to just fix the site than to make everyone change to dark mode no no no yeah it would I'm just showing you why I guess this is happening so you know I toggled system appearance and um there you go changed that's what it looks like for us yeah so um I can do the same so I can just be like okay uh wait did I see on yours an that it recorded your idea on your profile page um no I think this was the social media posts from our previous uh when we were building the social Med like when we started with a social app oh oh yeah it was recording those but it's not recording the sorry ideas we do need to fix that but that's just one prompt like everything here can be one prompt like we can um you know hunker down for another hour and like get that all done if we want to but yeah that that the progress that we've made so far is is pretty pretty crazy maybe try and go like five more prompts and see what we can do in five more prompts and put a limitation on it and uh try and accomplish as much as we can with that because I still got to get packed I'm about to fly to La we're about to do a s-day Sprint on creating um content with cursor and like a full-on Basics and and some other things it's going to be fun oh yeah so the things that come to my head after this an would be up updating a profile picture and then like being able to toggle the and mark the check boxes as done to like and maybe a progress bar oo that's easy to add actually on the card you should be able to mark them as is complete and it'll show you like a percentage bar of how I think we've done that together um yeah we have we have um should you should only the people who um created uh the idea be able to do that or anyone yes yes it should definitely you should not be able to mark off someone else's to do l so I just went to dark mode now and uh the app looks the same so if I toggle like you guys should be able to reload the page and it should be a white background now it looks great now wait it actually looks real good um the homepage looks clean okay so I also save that now I'll reset the composer again because we're discussing something completely new I think a lot of people they use the same composer and that's when they don't get good results the context gets overwhelmed um but for now we have to reset it but yeah so uh let's add a feature I know this is this might be annoying but one thing I need to change on this app is calling it social media app yeah luckily that's about the easiest change we can make okay I I can't I can let what do you want it what do you want it to call what do you want to call it startup idea startup ideas is Bank okay so here you know you don't need to know how to code to do this I'll show you show everyone like an easy way to do this without going into cursor so for this these kind of things you might not want to eat your prompts up and whatever so you can search exact text that shows up on the screen that's not user generated content like none of this stuff will show up because this is all user generated content but just stuff that's the same for every user so you can see that there's like a some text here that says social media app you can just change that there uh startup ideas Bank sure and that should instantly reflect um or you could just ask urser to do it like that would also work so do whatever you want I think yeah startup idea community and then just call it sick sick I don't know if you see that idea on sick last night I gave it a oneop are why SB doesn't have the same ring to it no s is startup idea database I like Sid Sid s just sounds like your cousin Sid I think of the sloth from Ice Age but oh yeah that's right by the way if you are going to become a senior software composer you need to get a mechanical keyboard it's quite literally you know step one to be to to becoming a cursor Pro yes and and get a good voice um like I use tastic and so like a lot of these things you can just say with your voice it's really fun there are probably more errors just because you try and go faster but like it's a lot more fun it's it's a lot more free flowing to just look at your site and you're like I want to change this this this and this and this and outline it with your voice um and then it'll make the changes I post a video on Twitter of me doing it fully like every single step with just my voice and it was crazy you get in a deeper Flow State when you use your voice so it made these changes and um yeah so the steps aren't showing up and this is likely you know because the data is saved in a different format um because we can see some of the data showing up and suddenly it's not showing up so let's say we create a new post um hotel for dogs um and this is something that you'll get better at like as you build more things and just understand like how stuff is working under the hood um but yeah um wait so this is actually really important that if what what an just talking about right now I guess I'll let him fix this era this is something he taught me early on and I dealt with it a lot you see how it's showing up now um basically the code that he generated earlier had a specific format and once he made the change right he's like now I want to be able to see it like this and once he made the change the posts that became before it aren't compatible with that new format so like he my initial Instinct would be like ah this isn't working but what really you need to do is just generate another component which he just did and now it's compatible and it actually is functional and it's working and so that definitely remember that because you will run into that guaranteed that looks pretty good honestly yeah so I can like check these off and like if I reload the page it saves that data and you guys should see it me checking these off um on your side as I can see it can see it right I'm going to generate yeah generate a new one and while they're generating that I'll show you like how this works in Firebase so in Firebase um wait sorry like what how cool is this this is just this is insane yeah let's let's soak this in for a bit this is kind of cool soak Us in you know this is this is incredible like this is a new social behavior that I just think is so interesting so can you guys check off I like my idea or not I cannot okay perfect so it's working is intended and that was just one promt so it's it's getting good obviously viously the design needs some more work um but yeah that's just another prompt uh profile picture upload that'd be more fun yeah we can do that so accept these changes it'd be more fun and then uh maybe change it to our name I think that would be good that would kind of complete the experience um for this episode's purpose you know like we see our faces and have our proper name I don't know I don't know if I want my name okay well you can be a non you can do something crazy yeah that's fair you can I guess that's probably smart you haven't signed the um terms and agreements of the site we could do whatever we want with your data right I'm giving exactly the idea now is owned by Riley [Music] Brown there's a whole like agency service business that you can create by just using cursor repet this template to go and build apps for for businesses too yeah I encourage that like we want I want people to make money with the template I think that's awesome so an is saying I want to allow the users to upload profile pictures and for those photos to show up on the home feed make the necessary changes to allow me and that's a good that's a good lesson there it's like make the necessary changes to allow me to do blank maybe you don't know how you want it to be designed but like make the changes so that I can do a specific thing it'll figure it out it's definitely a lot less pressure this episode than with the last one when I was worried I wasn't going to create it at the end yeah you were sweating but you made it you made it happen people should definitely go back to that old episode to see Riley sweat a little bit because that will be you in your first your first St oh it'll be probably worse than that but you just have to keep pushing through it it's too much fun okay so we got an error um I'm just going to just do the same thing just copy the error and past it it's it is pretty insane how that's how you've solved every error so far basically I actually think every error you've B You' might have given a little extra instruction with the error but like you have not even opened the code except for to show the example that you could change the title I haven't I just compos the whole time um okay let's reload this page failed to load ideas oh yeah I I see it on my end oh you see the profile picture upload yeah and you can choose a display name um there is an error ER yeah yeah I'm getting error to and my homepage says failed to load startup ideas um so I am just going to paste these errors in so on the homepage you see there is fail to load startup ideas I'm going to click the dev tools again and like you can expand these errors usually and like um just copy the relevant message um so the UI looks good with some errors actually I think the homepage looks very good like it's a pretty clean site it's clean which is great for an MVP it's not like the most beautiful website I've ever seen but it's clean yeah I mean we haven't even got to the design yet we've we've given One Design prompt that's right uh for the card because you got to focus on the function as much as you'll want to do the design like you just have to remember that like without the core functionality you just have a pretty piece of artwork hanging in in your back closet no one can actually use it so I just gave it the two errors there's one on the homepage um and then there was one when I was updating the profile did it have to do with permissions for seeing the profile picture on the homepage um no I think it just uh CH changed some code so I just reloaded the homepage it's loading now yeah it's loading now and now let me update my profile okay so um it's giving this error again I'll copy it and I think it's interesting too like I've noticed a lot of people under a lot of like commenting on a lot of videos saying like oh I'm going to wait another year so it gets till it gets even easier and I just think there's a massive opportunity right now great asess you said to create an agency and doing it when it's hard is better because by the time the creating what we're doing now gets easy the people who start now are going to be creating even better sites by then and like right because there's a group of people always pushing the edges of all these new things right now there's not very many people pushing the edges of AI websites which is where you will find probably the most profitable Industries um or in interesting niches to get into and so that would be my advice to anyone who's like oh I'm going to wait for this to get a little bit easier which it will okay wow I just uploaded my profile picture yep it should show up on the the profile um let's see maybe I have to create a new post for this to show up on the posts um still not showing up on the on the homepage as a comment it doesn't is it is it only for the Post oh I didn't tell it to do it for the comments so I don't know if it be able to figure that out but I can no it's okay UNH handle I just tried to create a post runtime error yeah I saw that um we can solve that if you just reload your page it should go away um for now but we can again it's just you can copy that paste that in and should be good love how we're just cooking with boys you're you're muted uh Riley but in my head I imagine you said something really witty with cooking no I said it's really fun it's very fun to get like to just ideate and just like throw things out there especially if you don't like not every time when you make something there's urgency to create something quickly like it's it's an art form it's fun to be creative and Just Vibe out and make something fun and so we'll definitely do that in the community too just to like hang out and make fun apps it's also very rewarding to use your own tools I found like my notes app that I use is like my own little Notes app and it does only what I want it to um it doesn't do anything else like what does it do what are things that I just like I like the way it looks I said it was it was the first app that I've created it it has like built-in uh AI features it has a voice app uh like a voice record a recorder which I'm huge on I love voice recorders recording stuff still not popping up no it's not using my profile photo um okay I'm going to reset this and I'm going to Del it from scratch storage could it be a storage rule thing uh I've said permissive storage rules I think it's uploading the photo I can check let me just check and Firebase is owned by Google right right yes Google Firebase firebase.com we're going to be using another alternative for the next one it's a little bit different and it's more visual it's called subab base or supab base I don't know how to pronounce it yeah it's not because of that um it's basically trying to get the the wrong data um and yeah using super base would definitely help with this because our data organization is gotten a little messy cuz start with the social app and then modified it a little bit um but it should be able to fix this in a couple prompts um just going through that um yeah should we should we do that or something else I would say if we can get it in two prompts we should just do it and call it good and that would kind of complete the app I feel like just from a visual standpoint it would look be a nice um ending to the video it's totally it gives us that clean payoff at the end that I think we got last episode but this is like much more difficult they said they said we couldn't do it they said we couldn't create a social media app in under two hours but but we did it yeah Greg what do you think like what do you want to build like when you're when you see this do you have any projects in your head you're like you know what if I dive super deep into this the first thing I want to create is yeah so I actually tweeted something and I was thinking about you and this when I was tweeting it I said how do you build startups in 2024 step one tweet about it if it gets love create a video about it if it gets love create a lead magnet about it if it gets love create a private membership Community about it if it gets love create a SAS agency software out of it if it gets love hire yourself out of it if it continues to scale you can retire or just do it all again and I I think I'm going to post on Twitter post a video see what gets traction and then just be like hey I've got a fun Saturday I've got a Saturday afternoon that I can go Tinker on something and just put stuff out there not be afraid to put stuff out there and treat putting out software almost as if it's like putting out a tweet yes yeah I love that and and you just continue down the process if you're you're like all right we have critical mass um like let's just build this into a bigger app I I love that mentality yeah um that's super cool because like I think I think there's going to be platforms Built For This like where there it'll be like a Sandbox thing where it's it'll be like the uh the Tik Tock of social of applications where you can like create a little environment and you scroll through them find ones that you like because it's going to be so easy to create little web experiences um I think that would be really fun yeah and people will be able to just remix other people's ideas yes the same way they remix uh Tik Tok that's right or Tik toks or retweets or quoted tweets um it's a lot like it's like a way more efficient and userfriendly GitHub kind of yeah like way more simplified should we try and upload another one an yeah I think that might be good and this is good like this is realistic you end up you might get stuck on one annoying thing for longer than you want to yeah you might and will and that's okay yeah it's fine yeah you definitely will yeah it wouldn't be fine if you didn't have essentially these assistants that you can ping at any time like so they're there for you okay it's it's it's going down a bad ravit hole here um so I'm just going to reset this um it's good like this will happen like this probably like the worst case scenario you can just discard all the changes that you made um and you should attempt to to try again um just because you know it was just breaking things further and further you don't want that to happen um so you should probably just um start from scratch and give it an idea so um and what we can do if we run out of time is just like last time you know like when we have time to throw on some extra things like we can very easily uh add some features to this and make it look super clean it's just you know like we've only been doing this for 90 minutes did you do a screenshot on the last one on uh no I did not I wonder if that would help yeah um I don't I don't think so just because um the issue was it was just storing the data weirdly um and this is what's cool about like finding other people who are also doing this and like it's fun to kind of follow along I actually learn a lot when I follow along when other people are driving and you just you're exposed to different types of Errors it will help you solve them faster in the future when you run into the same problems 100% same thing with any skill yeah totally I think it's being with other people uh looking over and seeing what you know what are they doing oh how do you do that I think it's watching content like this and with people who just like are live cooking and and taking notes um that's what you have to do and then it's also just making it a habit like do you know this is something that you need to practice every day if you want to get great yeah like Mr Beast Mr Beast talked about it he famously talked about that over and over again he's like he's surrounded himself with people as obsessed as he was and that's all they did every day totally um and you'll get better you'll learn from other people's mistakes screen of red that's that's fun you know it's yeah people want to get in your head so it's interesting to see how you approach it yeah I'm curious as to what you think the error is more specifically I I'm curious actually because I've run into a lot of problems with images images can be um annoying it's just like how the data is being uploaded and accessed is weird so um um we have this we have Firebase and you can see over here like the photo URL was being uploaded like if I copy this URL and I go to it it this was the image that I uploaded so it works you know the uploading works it's just accessing it is a bit weird um the reason why I think the app is just getting confused on um how and where to get the profile photo from the user and so um this is also something that we're going to update our template with but is just like show people how um you know how defining the data that your app has before you start building it is a better way to to um not face these errors when you're when you're going through it so like creating creating a prevention prior to even building out the app like as it's building out the app originally it'll have that in mind it'll make it easier to access the data when it needs it yeah I mean if you can like have like I think this is why I think super base would be useful like you were saying Riley which is like you can have like a strict um basically like a Google sheet of your data and then it'll know exactly what to use when that's kind of the issue that's happening right now it's just it's it's getting confused with that um and it's throwing a lot of Errors so yeah um it's also easier to just based on the I watched two long videos on subab base but it basically you have you ever used notion Greg like yeah our whole company runs on notion yeah so like basically I have a lot of experience with notion I ran a previous company out of notion and learning notion if you understand notion it makes this process a lot easier because I just think of a website as just a giant notion rapper because like on notion you can add new columns um which are just new Fields basically and they can be either a dropdown a to-do list you can upload files and it makes it super easy to picture the data but subab base is the only one that actually has it shows it's in table format uh and so like it makes it super easy to picture like what pieces of data would be on one of these cards right here like um which is just the same as notion and like notion has like a their calendar feature I think is their best feature that they have where like you can put in a due date and then you can switch it to calendar view and see when they're due and you can also do that on a website if you set up your table the same way right um yeah okay so this is clearly um getting confused with what's going on um so I'm just going to reject all the changes cuz we didn't make any that were useful um and what's going through your mind right now um in terms of now I think it might be uh like how the data is being displayed on the profile page it works um but when you go to the home homage it's not working so clearly there is something that's like [Music] um something that the AI is not doing correctly um and I'm just trying to figure out how to give it context to do that correctly so maybe I'll be more specific you know I'll be like um going to the profile Tab and I'll give it the exact file which is just profile page um shows me the current profile picture that I have for my user correctly I want the same profile picture shown in the comments um under a startup idea in startup idea um make the necessary changes to show profile pictures next to comments um under a startup post the whole code base as well yeah after I actually yeah I get I start re like reiterating things a lot more once you get into these failure Loops um and it's really good the Cadence he has right now where it's like he tries four or five times he scraps the changes starts again from like a slightly different strategy and like yeah every single time you want to be more I get more aggressive and longer and sometimes it can get me out of it like I probably would have stressed it I probably would have done like four sentences I'm like just to reiterate the every single profile picture should be connected to that profile everywhere that profile comes up so whether it's in the comments whether it is a post uh whether it's a startup idea post uh one other thing that I'm thinking about is that it might be getting confused about posts the fact fact that there are startup ideas when the template is built for a social media app so it's like is it getting that mixed up between a startup idea and a post um I actually ran into the same issue when I was creating the last one Greg where I you know this it started out with um sip or spit and then I changed it to pin or drop but the page was still slash siips so that was a huge issue for me and then once I fixed that error it got easier but like I wasted an hour on that so sometimes the naming can become an issue not saying that's the issue now but just kind of going through some common problems I've run into right no that's a good tip yeah um okay so the new comments now have profile pictures it was just the old comments that are not showing it so um so we should all create new posts um yeah create a new post and or a new comment under the post but yeah they should uh have the profile pictures okay so it finally got right with this with this prompt um it took a while but yeah uh I got it and I didn't have to manually go in I was like oh no now is the time but it it didn't cool there we go thank you I was going to say we did it but you did it um thank you I appreciate it I don't think you realize you know our last video had had hundreds and hundreds of comments of people being like wow I'm so excited to build things and uh I think people are going to watch this [Music] and they're going to be Builders so uh thanks for for inspiring them yeah I'm excited to see what people create hell yeah um so couple to-dos if you've made it this far in the episode um one is go to what what's the URL senior Swiss seniors sswc docomo composer and uh there you will find a link to the community we opened up S days ago and we're at like 2200 members MERS um Co and yeah it's going to be a lot of fun we're going to I'm going to LA tomorrow and we're going to work on a lot more Basics educational content right now we've been uh making a lot of content like wow type content you can create a website in x amount of time but like we're going to bring it down to the basics and go slower because a lot of people are a little bit more confused but we're we're going to bring people all the way through the process I want everyone to create and deploy a web app that they love it's a really fun experience so beautiful so that's to do that's that's one thing you could do um and then the second thing is just uh we'll be in the comment section here so uh just comment if you enjoyed this it got your brain thinking if you have any questions um and uh I respond to almost every comment so go ahead and you know feel free to comment and then the the third thing is of course you're going to want to like this video uh so you get more videos like this in your feed um and then you're going to want to

beauty of it you build the audience the world is your oyster as you know like once you have the audience it the product's the easiest thing to do I mean even if you don't want to create your own just promote other people's ADHD apps like but the point is everyone's trying to go they go right for the product they're going okay I want to make an ADHD chair they're forgetting the most important part and the opportunity in this space is to create the brand so when you think of I need help with ADHD I want to do something about it I go to Julius and that's the brand associated with this growing huge market and you don't see very often a huge growing Market without a go-to brand and that's what we're [Music] seeing we're we're going straight into it yep Brian Dean on the podcast I think this might be the best ever episode of the 150 episodes or what ever I've done in this podcast you're literally calling me from your couch yeah it's more of an intimate uh episode we're getting we're just going right into it it's already the best episode it's only like 20 seconds in so all the pressure is off now totally yeah we wanted to invite you into Brian Brian's home yeah that's what we're going for production meeting we had before is H what we talked about exactly all right man we're getting into it so you are the trend God that I'm just gonna I'm just GNA call you that that's what I'm gonna do okay not gonna argue with that you might even call yourself the exploding topics God all right and so I was hoping that you can come on and you can share some of the most interesting Trends topics and ideas and you're a listener of the Pod so you know what this audience wants uh Brian what do you got for us yeah the first idea right off the bat is one that I would pay for it's a take my money situation is an AI content updater so there are a million and one tools for creating content with AI there's you know content writing tools there's uh tools that do outlines there are tools that rewrite your content there are tools that'll take your long form video and chop it up into shorts but what real Publishers need is help updating their existing Content Library so for example with exploding topics we have maybe like 500 blog posts which is nothing compared to most Publishers and even that we have trouble keeping up to date we have about uh you know one and a half full-time people constantly updating this content and they're going in they're saying okay this stats a little bit old or this isn't really as relevant anymore or there's a link that's broken or there's a source that's more recent we can use and they're doing it manually so if there was a a tool that could go through existing Content Library find areas that need to be updated and actually go into your CMS and update it it would be a GameChanger what do you think you can charge for something like that I would say this would be something you'd want to go more Enterprise for sure like starting at a thousand bucks a month because anyone who has a small con if you don't publish that much or have a big Library it's not that valuable because you can do it manually you can just use spreadsheets and have a couple staff members do it that's what we're doing now but let's say you have 25,000 posts you're like Tom's guide or something you it's and it's insane to even think of doing that manually but you need to to keep the stuff up to date because it's about technology so I would say you're starting at like th000 5,000 10,000 you know that big Enterprise contract level and if you were to start something like this okay so this is a great idea I see the need I actually I would pay pay definitely a few thousand doar a month for something like this uh how would you go about like actually starting this like what do you do what okay what's next the first thing I would build it for myself so I'd be my own case study to start with um and it's one of the those business ideas are usually in my opinion the best because you're you you're using it yourself so you can see what needs to be added what doesn't need to be done where does it mess up where is it good where is it bad so first thing would definitely be building a beta that I test out on my own site or a different property that I own to get the nuts and bolts out um and then from there I'd probably do manual Outreach and just be like you have this massive Library I'm seeing a bunch of posts that haven't been updated in three years we have software that'll just go in use Ai and give it some the updates that it needs what about charging per update instead of going monthly there's this monthly subscription fatigue I feel like a no-brainer offer could be like per update what do you think yeah I love it yeah and better expansion Revenue too because with the tier system it's hard to get people to move up from the different tiers you can I mean it's not possible but there's friction there you have to lock out a feature or lock out a number of seats the person has to click a button they have to then uh you know decide on the next plan and I don't know if I really need it or should I just wait till next month but if you just do it where you know it's the first 10 updates are free or five updates are free and then $1 each additional update per month then that that's actually probably better and have you seen anyone doing this no but I haven't looked like super extensively but I haven't seen it feel like you would know yeah I kind of yeah I feel like I would have come across it because I've had this idea since I started the exploring topics blog got big you know with you know we got like 650,000 visitors a month and I'm thinking how and we're hiring all these people to update I'm just like how can we automate this so I have my radar set to find this and I haven't seen anything out there for this Brian this is what I'm talking about this this is such a good idea yeah this is a take my money situation and the best part about it is that it's a it's a no-brainer offer for the right customer if you reach out to a smaller blog and doing $49 a month you're going to be in a world of pain with this product but if you go to the bigger Publishers that have at least and it's easy to find you're you're literally your leads are sites that have more than x number of pages on the site and assuming those are that's blog content and you just cold Outreach and say I not and I noticed you have these posts that are out of date we just built something that can update them or if you want to go crazy here are you know here's the updated versions that our software created for you you know let me know if this is something you you'd like to automate sh don't tell anyone but I've got 30 plus startup ideas that could make you millions and I'm giving them away for free these aren't just random guesses they're validated Concepts from entrepreneurs who built hundred million plus businesses I've compil them into one simple database compiled from hundreds of conversations I've had on my podcast but the main thing is most of these ideas don't need a single investor some cost nothing to start I'm pretty much handing you a cheat sheet the idea bank is your startup shortcut just click below to get access your next cash flowing business is waiting for you I like it I like it so dude this is just I like it there's nothing more to say yeah I have literally nothing more to say do you want my next idea I guess that's the as a host I thought you would just like ask but no I'll just I'm gonna I'm gonna make it weird I'm just gonna try to make it as weird as possible all right great so my second one is definitely not indie hacker business this would require some cash so I don't know if that's against the rules Greg uh it depends how much cash how we I think you like this idea though hold on just tell me how much cash are we talking uh in the million probably so no you know Millions is wait wait no Millions is in one to two million or yes get started proceed so do you know Factor 75 no I do not they're are like a meal service that there are these like pre-prepared meals that you buy they sponsor a bunch of YouTube channels and you basically say okay I'm vegan or I'm keto and they deliver let's say seven meals a week and you warm them up and they're ready to go and they deliver them to your door these are huge right now this meal service but the problem is they're the meals are like not the highest quality they're about 10 bucks a pop 11 bucks a pop my idea and something else I would pay for is like an Uber black of meal delivery where we're talking $50 to to start and it's Chef prepared meals Super G May and it's essentially like what you get with a private Chef without needing to have a private Chef come to your house because my buddy has a private chef and I go to his house and she makes these amazing meals and I'm always like oh I should hire her but then I'm like I'm gonna have someone come into my house and cook in my kitchen and I'm playing fortnite with my friends it's weird but why would I do that and I don't want to order a meal that's like 10 bucks their margins you know how much does it cost them to make they're using like the lowest quality ingredients possible I'll pay 50 because it's what I would pay for a nice meal out for a chef prepared meal it's not made to order like that's the thing about Factor 75 but you can tailor it to your dietary restrictions gluten-free or what have you so for me that would be another take my money situation I was uh I had a hot dog the other day in C in Quebec and the hot dog it was like I don't know 79 cents Canadian which is like 40 I don't know 45 cents us and I'm like halfway through it and and I'm like wait wait wait a second if I'm paying 48 cents for this they're paying 10 to 15 to 20 cents for this I probably shouldn't be putting this in my body and I feel like that's kind of e even these you know these meal planning services like even if they say it's dope for you and I just I don't buy it at 10 yeah the same that's what I'm saying so I would pay 50 even if it was the same meal I'm a sucker I just don't want to think you're getting like I don't want to think I'm eating something that cost them a buck to make yeah um I might as well get a Hungry Man meal for that so why not get a nice so it would be highend and it would come at like you know with Uber Eats it's like some guy gives it to you in a paper bag here you go this would be presented almost like an Apple product you open it up and it would be like beautifully presented it would be this whole like culinary experience at home because even during Co I remember a lot of really nice Michelin star restaurants started doing Uber Eats because they were closed and they were figuring out ways to do this so it's not totally unprecedented to pay this much for essentially a delivery meal but you have to order from Uber Eats this would replace those sort of prepared meals that come and you put them in the fridge and then warm them up when you want but they're going to be like 50 to 75 bucks a pop and it's going to be like lobster and free range chicken chicken and grass-fed beef and and stuff like that and so you warm it up yourself right you put it like in the oven yeah or the microwave or microwave but no you wouldn't want a microwave no no and oh for this thing no no dude no this would what what do you what are you come on you're not a barbarian Brian you're right I am I guess because I thought of that I must be so I mean I don't know if you need one1 to2 million doll to start this to start this idea yeah maybe not I just usually it's more than you think so I usually go up so what whatever number first pops into my head I usually double it um so that's where I came up with that that number I thought it cost like 500k so probably double that because of all the stuff you know that doesn't come to your to your head I mean to test this idea isn't going to take $1 to $2 million if you want you could do it yourself I mean you could do it in your house I invested in the company that went out of business that did that here in uh in Lisbon where I spend most of my time they started a atome Uber Eats basically home-cooked Uber Eats and they partnered with different homecooked chefs and they would make a meal for you on demand at their house instead of at a restaurant and they would ship it to you so I have some experience in this world and I know that the the challenge with that business is the delivery on demand element where you need need to make it now someone sends an order you need to be like at the ready ready to go and if you're not a restaurant or a ghost kitchen it doesn't make sense that's why I like these prepared meals because you can do them at a massive scale and just ship them out all right I like it I don't you know we have a we have a thing on this pod do I sip this idea or do I spit this idea I don't like it sip is I like I I sip the test of it but I I don't know at scale if I love this idea like operating this in like 50 ities to me seems like a mess but I do think that maybe this is just a business where it's in one or two cities and it's not crazy to do a few million bucks per city is it no if you just New York San Francisco Yeah Austin a couple of those Tech cities where people will have have you know more money than cents like me who will just pay 50 bucks for a meal that someone made that's you know you're picturing them in a white like with white gloves making this thing yeah suckers the sucker Market really yeah um that they'll pay for it because I'm at the point where I like cooking but I'm a little bit like I don't want to have to cook every night and the the challenge is Uber Eats is like a mixed bag I don't really enjoy the whole experience of like ordering waiting for it so these meals sound like a great thing but again 10 bucks it's not as bad as the hot dog but it's the same idea and there's no don't look at me like that Brian I saw you look down on me I'm not not Jud you are judging I see I see you okay if it was like a dollar man come on but anyway the idea is that you the reason that I like it is that in most markets there's an option for a higher tier whether it's cars software gyms there's usually a market for this higher end version of that thing but I haven't seen it in this in this space yeah I also if I was doing this I think the trend Around clean eating I'm sure you're seeing a lot of that like everything's clean people are just using the word clean it's like clean is the new healthy you know in the 80s and 90s people used to say oh that's healthy now people say oh that's clean yeah um so I think if you ride on that Trend like clean meals I think that could be really interesting and I also think handwritten notes or just stories you know people especially suckers suckers love stories they do they can't get enough of them but you're right I can imagine opening it and you get a little note from the chef like I hope you enjoy it doesn't have to be for every meal CU you're setting these in bulk right like a week or seven 10 20 30 meals at a time so one note from the chef that says hey uh I hope you enjoyed these meals we made for you this week Greg you know Chef Greg I think that would go a long way for getting those suckers to share on social media I have you ever seen Lost in Translation the movie a great movie Gray movie Incredible movie highly recommend so that movie they're in the Park Hyatt in Tokyo so I was there recently and I'm having breakfast and as I'm sitting down for my my first breakfast when my first breakfast in Japan uh the chef comes over and he puts down a plate of uh mateline cookies um these like French cookies that he talks about that his mom used to make and now he makes them and he comes from Paris and the whole story and I'm like melting I'm quite literally melting uh and and then I pick up one of the cookies and of course it's like perfectly hot temperature and he was like that's the way my mom used to like it that story like productizing that in this there you go that you know huge margin in in that yeah for sure man yeah that company that I invested here was called Mama food they did that and it definitely helped add that element of personal touch but it's just logistically was difficult but yeah they did that they would have in your like when you ordered from instead of going by restaurant you go by Chef so you go for like Chef number one oh this lady she's from Bangladesh and this is her meal she made back in the day or her mom made for her so it had that little bit of story um element to it you have another idea yeah yeah so the the other idea I have if I don't know if you'll like this one how many ideas do you have you said come to with some half-baked ideas two to three I think I I've I have to check my notes I have my notes uh written down I wrote a bunch down so the other one I have is based on a lot of trend data we're seeing we're seeing a bunch of Trends in the ADHD space especially when it comes to products so more and more people are getting diagnosed and self- diagnosing themselves with ADHD and there's a lot of products around it now like for example some trends that we're seeing in that space include ADHD timers ADHD watches ADHD chairs ADHD coaches H ADHD apps um and this is basically a booming Market that people aren't really talking about that much so for me the opportunity isn't necessarily in these individual SKS these individual products it's in no one's creating a the brand for ADHD so anyone that creates that community that brand around ADHD then you can the world is your oyster when it comes to selling these products you can sell your own you can sell affiliate products you can be you promote other people stuff but I haven't seen that out there my wife recently got diagnosed with ADHD and it's it's it's interesting because a lot of people who are like influencers in this space are saying saying you can use it as a superpower actually it can be an advantage for you and I feel like the first brand that comes out and positions ADHD as that is like we help you take this thing that could be looked at as as a disadvantage and it's actually something you can use to your advantage we'll show you how and we have a community of people that will help you do it I here's how I would name a product like that so I get migraines and I used to get embarrassed about getting migraines cuz like I'd be doing something and then all of a sudden like my vision would get blurry and it really sucked um and I would get this migraine and then I went to see a neurologist and he told me that this is when I was young he he was like you know he started off the conversation by saying you know you know who else had migraines and I was like no who who he was like julus Caesar and Julius Caesar did a lot of big things granted I think he probably killed a lot of people um because he was like a general and stuff like that but I mean he he was running Rome you know like he he he he was able to live a successful life whatever that meant uh at that time I think that with ADHD how do you find someone like that um so okay so if I was creating a migraine brand I would call it Caesars or Julius for ADHD who is someone like that that that people look up to and then just call it that yeah that's a good idea that's a good way to do it yeah that's a good branding the person would have to be you know someone that's not a likeness that's copyrighted or trademark so it' have to be back in the day like that yeah exactly okay so I buy the thesis but what it's not clear to me is what the actual product is but it could be that's the beauty of it you build the audience the world is your oyster you know you don't you can worry about the product later it can be a suite of products it can be start with an app and then be fidget toys and then be a chair like once you have the audience it the product's the easiest thing to do I mean even if you don't want to create your own just promote other people's ADHD apps like but the point is everyone's trying to go they go right for the product they're going okay I want to make an ADHD chair they're forgetting the most important part and the opportunity in this space is to create the brand so when you think of I need help with ADHD I want to do something about it I go to Julius and that's the brand that's associated with this growing huge market and you don't see very often a huge growing Market without a go-to brand and that's what we're seeing quick ad break let me tell you about a business I invested in it's called boring marketing.com so a few years ago I met this group of people that were some of the best SEO experts in the world they were behind getting some of the biggest companies found on Google and the secret sauce is they've got a set of technology and AI that could help you outrank your competition so for my own businesses I wanted that I didn't want to have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I didn't want to depend on ads to drive customers to my businesses I wanted to rank high in Google that's why I like SEO and that's why I use boring marketing.com and that's why I invested in it they're so confident in their approach that they offer a 30-day Sprint with 100% money back guarantee who does that nowadays so check it out highly recommend boring marketing.com who else like who do you look up to in terms of other brands that have done something similar that they're that they're just amazing at building audience in building brand well in meditation like for example I don't know if you know Dan Harris from 10% he built a huge meditation brand where they were you know meditation was seen as like a woo woo thing that you did in your garden cross-legged and he was a newscaster who had panic attacks and he used um he wrote a book called 10% happier about his journey from being a skeptic about meditation to uh someone that practiced it every day and then he created an App around that and they have a whole community and a brand so he was able to take that and turn that into a a brand for a specific Niche within meditation that is this like skeptical uh group so that's one that comes to mind has built completely from scratch in a growing space um that's one how about you do you have any Greg that you can think of the one that comes top of mind is a friend of mine and friend in the Pod her name is Natalie Ellis she started it started off as like basically a meme page called girl boss I think it was called um and she was sharing memes and quotes and stories around female entrepreneurship women L businesses uh and it grew to 6.4 or something million followers on Instagram big you know and once she had that she was like okay what are the things that I could sell templates uh a membership uh you know events uh now she has one of the top podcast one of the top business podcasts so um she went from a meme page to millionaire basically quite quickly and uh it started with the brand yeah yeah I mean there's so I mean some businesses start with a product and they do well that way there's no right or wrong way but for me there okay well what's the right way I guess I mean my take is I mean I was joking a little bit but my take is it's way easier to sign up up with an Instagram account than it is to you know build a d Toc product and figure out logistics and and Manufacturing and all that sort of thing so I think that if you're creating a minimal viable product I always think about it as like the minimal VI product is the Social account yeah for sure I'm I'm with you 100 per. especially because in this particular area the the crowded area is the product area so if you were to create another ADHD chair you're one of like a hundred of those but and you can get knocked off really easily on Amazon if you're a brand then you don't need to worry about knockoffs because you'll say we have the best ADHD chair or we have the best ADHD planner and next thing you know people are buying it I like it you want to give us one last Brian idea I need to uh check my notes on that oh yeah this is another good I think you might sip this one as the kids say Greg so this is another back to B2B a Content repurposing service so this is another scratch my own itch thing so if you work in uh content marketing SEO for bigger Brands they always even smaller Brands they have content that's just sitting around collecting dust that was published once it's an email newsletter it's a video it was a webinar it's an article it's a a tweet and they never repurpose that content and for me that's the greatest opportunity with content marketing right now is repurposing rather than creating original stuff from scratch because it's cheaper and it has a proven track record already so in my case for example with exploring topics we have all this blog content and we're starting to repurpose it into videos on the on a YouTube channel that we started so it's so much easier to create those videos because we already have the building blocks of the article we don't have to think and say oh what should we make a video about oh what should it you know what should we start with we go okay here are the biggest marketing Trends we have a blog post about marketing trends that was updated last week let's turn that into a video or the reverse let's take the video and turn it into a a bunch of shorts and an article and an email newsletter and a webinar or whatever so for me that's another take my money if someone emailed me and said hey you have all this content let's get some more value out of it yeah so Mega you know me too well oh I think uh yeah what I'm seeing is there's a bunch of AI tools that are promising that it's like give us your content and we'll spit out other formats of it and I just don't think that the AI tools are probably 100% there yet um so I do think that oh so that's one end of the spectrum on the other end of the spectrum is humans creating new content which is like well I don't want new content I've got all this great stuff so I agree I think that there's there's some something in between that is a big opportunity and I think the way to sell it is you do a cold reach out and you're like hey you wrote this post in 2005 I've turned it into this uh do you like it yes you know and if and then you have to prove yourself on the cold DM basically yeah but I think like you said it's kind of an easy self for it's again it's kind of like the updating idea in the there's a small Market that will 100% get it and most people won't and that's fine because the market that get it that will get it is huge and they have money and they're willing and you're basically saying you know you're selling a dollar for a dime basically you're saying you have all this content you give me this money as a service and then we'll just get you more Roi from that content you felt obviously you felt good enough to create it once so why not just distribute it eight times in eight different formats and we'll do that for you so for me it's an easy sell easy everything the hard part is of delivery like you s like you said Greg where it's not something AI can do because it does require some Ingenuity in terms of what's the best way to turn this video into a blog post to turn this um you know blog post into a video however whichever direction you're going in because what a lot of people do is they'll say oh I want to get more out of my video so I'll get a transcript of the video and I'll publish as a blog post they never do well because you need someone to turn turn that into you can take that content turn into a blog post but you need to filter it through the lens of like writing it as if it was a blog post for the first time but even that is so much faster than writing from scratch so for me that that's the IDE another idea that I would happily be shelling out money for how how big is this idea how big could this get um I would say it Max like if you created a huge agency out of it like eight figures like 10 million cool all right all right there you have it those are my ideas those are really good ideas oh thanks man I spent some time on it I really want I wanted to come prepare I appreciate it it shows thank you for inviting us into your home uh on your couch it's it's it's it's very kind of you yeah hey you're welcome anytime Greg where could people get to know you better uh the best place is probably on X Brian Ean cool well well find you there and uh come back anytime please we'll do thanks for having me all right don't e any hot dogs okay okay see you later later [Music]

Title: I can't believe we coded an app with AI in 67 mins (V0, Cursor AI, Replit, Claude AI)
Published: 2024-09-01 17:01:57 UTC
Description:
In this episode, I am joined by Riley Brown, a leading AI Creator, we dive deep into the process of building an app only using AI. Riley shares his process and demonstrates how to use tools such as V0, Cursor AI and Replit to create and deploy apps in hours. Learn how to launch your next startup without needing to know how to code! 

1) Riley breaks down how to create a functional app using AI tools like V0, Cursor, and Replit - without writing a single line of code! 🛠️

•  Key insight: You can build complex apps in 10-15 hours with practice, even without coding experience.

2) The process involves:
• Using V0 for front-end design
• Cursor for code generation
• Replit for deployment

Pro tip: Screenshot designs you like and describe them to AI - instant working prototype! 

3) Riley's approach:
1. Visualize the app
2. Describe it to AI
3. Troubleshoot errors
4. Repeat until it works

"You will your way to a working app. It's guaranteed." - Riley 

4) Major hurdle: Connecting AI features to the app. It's tough, but persistence pays off!
•  Riley's advice: "Once you get the aha moment... you realize you're in charge. You don't need to ask anyone."

5) Cool project built during the pod: SIP idea analyzer!
Features:
• Extracts ideas from transcripts
• Categorizes as "SIP" or "SPIT"
• Saves ideas to user profiles

6) Key learning: Error messages are your friends!
• They help pinpoint issues.
• Riley's hack: If you're not getting errors, ask AI to "add error logs" to your code.
• Makes troubleshooting WAY easier! 

7) The power of AI coding tools:
• Recreate complex apps (like Notion) in hours
• Customize existing apps with new features
• Rapid prototyping and iteration

"To me, it's a no-brainer." - Riley on the cost-effectiveness of AI tools vs. hiring designers

8) Riley's closing thoughts: Composing code with AI is about persistence and creativity.
•  "I love the act of learning things and diving deep into rabbit holes."

9) Key takeaway: AI-powered coding democratizes app creation.
• It's not just about building businesses - it's a creative process anyone can enjoy!
• "Sometimes it's just fun to do this and to solve problems." - Riley

there's two types of people who've watched my videos and message me there's the people and it's not nowhere in between either they have fully pushed to the end and created basically a full app that they love or they got stuck on like the first few steps and gave up once you get the aha moment where you're like oh this works and you realize that like you're in charge you don't need to ask anyone like influencer you don't need an influencer or a teacher you just need to ask AI you need to ask Claude be like hey it didn't work for this and it might not give you the right answer on the first try but odds are by the second or third try like you will will your way to a working app I it's guaranteed I just think it separates the high agency people and the low agency people uh pretty [Music] well um Riley welcome to the show this is a startup ideas podcast where we talk about startup ideas but we're not necessarily talking about startup ideas today we're talking about how to how to use some so AI tools to build software right yeah um it's gotten a lot easier to create websites uh whether it's landing pages all the way on the other side of the spectrum like creating apps like notion I I've been creating I mean it takes six or seven hours if you like really want to go ham to create something that looks a lot like notion but with a full database storage and everything um fully with AI without writing a single line of code so so basically a 12 billion dollar company you can clone a lot of how it works well I'll give notion credit I mean they have a lot of it's It's a the skeleton of these apps but like you can remix them as we were talking before this there's certain apps I'm like I wish I had this feature I wish I had this feature and this feature I'm like wait why don't I just kind of screenshot the app tell the AI you know this is the general uh kind generally the way that you use the app and then you can just say but I also want to have these features and then if you have the grit to push through the errors because there's a lot of Errors once you start dealing with databases but usually Claude will figure it out and the more times you do it the better you will be at like fixing those errors and and you get better at problem solving just like anything and you can create some really cool things in like 10 to 15 hours of practice and that's what we're going to do today and by the end of this video you'll have a good idea and then you can start playing with yourself and start creating software absolutely um do you want me to just hop into yes all right let's just do this okay um has there cing session this is like live cooking you're the chef all right let's let's do this here okay so I'm going to share this screen is there been any good SAS ideas that You' guys have come up with I know you do those live sessions have you guys thought of anything recently yes uh you want me to pull one up sure I mean it's like the easiest way to use these tools is if you have some sort of idea in mind but I guess without an idea in mind um let's uh I guess I'll talk about what tools I want to talk about today so this right here is v0 so this is going to be uh this is front end uh and it's using nextjs which I literally have not coded I 50 days ago I had never coded in my life so I was like the first day I found claw artifacts and then I started plugging that code into repet but what VZ does is it lets you create these really cool front ends that look amazing and what we can do is we can say I want to create an app that help me out here uh what do you uh let's let's do something let's do a SAS app um let's do like a f one of those faceless video app creators can we do something like that okay um yes that's harder but yeah yeah um what about uh what about like an app that took your transcript of one of your videos divided them into startup ideas and then made like a presentation out of them that sounds amazing because yeah let's do that okay so let's just let's this is where you kind of look at the Shell right we're not going to on vzer we're not going to be able to add any AI features because that's all going to be done on the back end so let's think about layout so like what types of things would you want if you uh if you were to talking to someone on your podcast about startup ideas what would you want to know about them so like you have your uh you have just like the idea you have I guess like business Market how big it is how small it is I like um for for me what's important is to know what are the other big audience internet audiences and communities uh in that space so that just gives me more ideas okay so I guess um let's just call it internet uh audience um and then the idea is just the uh main startup idea the market will be um Market uh Market description yes and then Market size and we can start with that because we can always add to it but I think this is a good start so I want you to create a let's call it a presentation card a presentation card uh or slide as if it was going to be in a pitch deck about a startup idea and I let's just say make it a really slick uh design uh with cool uh subtle animations could you say could you say flat design shh don't tell anyone but I've got 30 plus startup ideas that could make you millions and I'm giving them away for free these aren't just random guesses they're validated Concepts from entrepreneurs who built hundred million plus businesses I've compiled them into one simple database compiled from hundreds of conversations I've had on my podcast but the main thing is most of these ideas don't need a single investor some cost nothing to start I'm pretty much handing you a cheat cheet the idea bank is your startup shortcut just click below to get access your next cash flowing business is waiting for you instead of slick okay do slick slick slf flat flat is a type of design I just want to see if it it knows what that is it's a little I don't even know I don't know what that is I'm curious I'm no designer but v0 lets me offload a lot of that and it also allows me to just like take things that I like and let's see we're actually going to see it work in real time so see it's kind of nice and I like the um I like this actually so what's happening now is it's literally building like the front end for this is that what's happening yeah so we can actually see the code right here so we're going to be using nextjs I have a template that allows me to very quickly create nexj uh nextjs apps so my partner and I an who is a developer and his main passion is like teaching people how to code and he's been incredibly helpful in teaching me and so we're building the most annoying part about coding is what he calls Plumbing where you have to go in you have to set up all the libraries and you have to make sure that you're organizing your files in the proper manner and when I was first starting that would take me three hours just to get to the point where I could put an idea that I had into a website but we're actually just doing all of that work so that you could start from from that exact point where you've done all the plumbing where you still have all the possibilities you've just done all the boring work like install the libraries because vzero Opera it has all of these different libraries already downloaded which is why it can render this normally you'd have to download a bunch of things to do it because coding is a lot of just libraries and it's kind of boring um but what you can also do on VZ you can actually say make changes so like make uh changes to this card I want to uh make changes to this card I want to have a border around the edges and add uh clean add light dots in the background as if it's graph paper uh very uh light and uh what's the word transparent and I just want to go over the example that you can kind of alter these uh and it just edits these live so it'll look back at the one it previously created and it will create a new one and so this is a lot like clawed artifacts but like on steroids and this is crazy yeah so you see that if you see those dots in the background it it's kind of a nice little nice touch there and it added the nice border and so you can always go back and see so we can see this one and we can go back and look at the previous version which didn't have a border nor those dots can I add one quick thing yeah I don't know how to and I want to see how you'd prompt this so on my podcast I say either an idea is sip or spit sip is if I really like the idea like startup ideas podcast and spit is if I really don't like the idea how can we put how can we do a prompt so we can show if the ideas is is sip or spit oh wow okay we could actually make this useful um wait hold on okay what if you had um a section of your show where people submitted startup ideas to your show via a text prompt yes and then it converted it into this and then it gave you like a toggle where you could either drag it to the right for almost like Tinder for sip or spit and based on what you do there then we'll add an animation left for like we could even add a sound effect too we could do that um and uh we could even add little light background music too um let me think about this for a sec um okay see this is the fun part this is I I love this process of like coming up with an idea now I'm like thinking okay what have I done like this before um and I think I think I got it okay so let's just describe this also I use voice a lot when I'm making these so I want to add an evaluation popup and this um I want you to include an icon and just have a placeholder uh image of a person and I want this to have I want to be able to drag this icon to the left which is spit and I or drag it to the right which is sip sip is positive spit is negative sip should be a green should be green spit should be red uh add a positive animation to the entire card when it gets dragged to spit and change the color to uh change the Border color to Green and for spit change the Border color to red and we can alter these animations too um and this will just take a second to load what I just said um uh the purpose of this is to evaluate this startup idea so that I can look an idea drag it in a certain direction and uh we can label it as either good or bad which I call Sip and spit I like to make sure I give it I tell it the purpose because it will actually use that in the prompt and it might add to its creativity so let's just try this and it might take a few times to get it right because this one's a little bit more advanced that's interesting that you gave it the purpose like you really did treat it like a a coworker well it'll it knows what types of animations it's trained on data oh what's it doing down here okay okay okay hold on is this a drag oh my God wait this isn't make this a slider let's just make it a circle for now I was going to make it your face uh once we actually make it into a thing so I want to um I want to drag the circle in a direction and that causes the green or red border uh let's say the slider should be right below the card and and if you drag actually We'll add that next um should be right below the card the user should be able to drag it in either direction by the way I'm happy that mistakes are happening right now because the whole point of this video is for people to learn how how you approach problems too yeah and I think people don't realize how on Twitter in YouTube you see all the highlight reels um of people creating amazing things with AI and you can absolutely do that o I like this dude that's actually amazing that's fire all right please let me do it all right so let's see okay all right so it says great idea and then uh needs impr wait is there oh you could add like um tiar so like a mini spit or like pretty good idea and then really good idea depending on how far you slide it we could do that pretty easily um but I I like the just it's either a spit or a spit or a sip or a spit um please change the Border color depending on the way um depending on um depending on the decision made by the user and then and then the popup message you have at the bottom should be sip or spit um let me see what happens if we zoom out here oh yeah that's actually really clean uh make the line thicker and the font for sip or or spit larger I'll try that one so instead of you know I went to Computer Science school so instead of writing code what you're doing is you're speaking English and then the code is coming out I call it composing code like you're you're kind of um you're just kind of guiding it you're telling it what you want and you know what things are feasible and what what types of things aren't feasible the more you do it um and I think this looks a lot cleaner what are your thoughts on the line thickness solid yeah it's it's really nice I like that it's it's thick yeah yeah okay and then boom um all right let's just go one more one more um uh now I want to create multiple slides of this once a decision decision is made it should go to the next startup idea and then I should make uh the same decision on the next one there should be an animation once I decide sip or spit make them positive or negative all right last one and then we can I get nervous you know I'm like what what's what are they going to come up with well you can always revert like I think you can retry this I actually haven't used this is the first day I've used this specific tool but it's very similar to the tools I've been using I think you can redo it so there's not a lot of pressure unless you're on a podcast um okay okay cool let's um let's just try it wait why does it it's like reversed here okay wait let me reset this I guess and while you're resetting it I have one small design detail I would like yeah changed I really like the dots that you have in the back but I don't find them pronounced enough is there anything you can you to help me absolutely hey um Greg wants the uh dots uh less transparent so have them more prominent and also below the Sip or spit bar uh it has two labels which is Sip and spit those should be reversed they should not you have the sip on the left and spit on the right please reverse those and the anim is kind of weird but like that's okay we can always fix that later because I agree I think the dots I love the the dot look I've been using that a lot yeah it adds a nice amount of of texture yeah like even like hores or diagonal grid lines are fun too I've noticed that I will say I think knowing how to design or knowing some of the terminology is still going to be super helpful so right 1,000% no no act like 1,000% taste is everything um and it's since I started doing this I'm now paying attention to every website I don't go to a website anymore without thinking like oh my God like how are they doing this or how can I replicate this or like what other tool could I create using this design method and it's it's really fun and it helps you actually like develop your taste for websites and finding cool designs because a lot of the best designs and this applies to video editing as well it's like below the level of your Consciousness like you don't notice it unless you're looking for it and it's fun once you okay now it it's flipped everything okay Jesus um this actually looks better though um despite the the it's off right it has sip on the left spit on the right so we need to ask for one more change let's just do this and then we can move on so um sip should be on the right spit should be on the left and we're just going to I'm just going to screenshot this is another good lesson actually I'm glad this happened actually we can screenshot this and you can actually bring it up and what I'm going to do here is I'm going to draw on this and so I'm literally going to I'm not going to use any colors we've already used before and I'm just going to Circle these and I'm just going to say and then I just screenshot it again and then copy it because it doesn't if you try and copy that it doesn't copy so now I'm just going to paste that image in there um and I'm going to say you see the labels oh those are the slides I just realized what that is those are the different slides like the first one is spit the second one is did you know that or am I don't Okay no Okay so like it's it's uh what it's doing is I just realized what it's doing is it's like a um so once you go spit or here you see that it's like that's your first the first one you did right so if I go but it's reversed because they're all it's messed up so might we might so okay actually okay sip should be on the right spit should be on the left please switch them for the ones I've circled in Blue uh number those and make them gray no matter what the choice was because I think it's kind of confusing when it's like this or maybe we I don't know but let's just try this but this is really useful to screenshot because we can screenshot any website we can go to any website you think is cool and literally screenshot it and then describe like what you should do with it and you can in one minute have a working prototype for it it's not a full app because it's not storing any of the data but it is a prototype it's pretty cool all right I hope we get it on this one good so far okay looks good now if we go sip boom now one was Sip two is spit three is spit and that's it it's pretty cool pretty darn cool pretty darn cool quick ad break let me tell you about a business I invested in it's called boring marketing.com so a few years ago I met this group of people that were some of the best SEO experts in the world they were behind getting some of

to have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I didn't want to depend on ads to drive customers to my businesses I wanted to rank high in Google that's why I like SEO and that's why I use boring marketing.com and that's why I invested in it they're so confident in their approach that they offer a 30-day Sprint with 100% money back guarantee who does that nowadays so check it out highly recommend boring marketing.com okay so now let's have some more fun here now we're going to use a tool that has been the most hyped tool since I don't know I can't even remember uh for those of you wondering it's called cursor and what I do so I have this template and you can link it below we created this template and we've basically done all the dirty work so this is nextjs which v0 is also nextjs so you can do a lot of the same things and so that's where I come up with just general ideas about interface I take a bunch of screenshots and then that then I'll give it to cursor to come up with the actual application I'll show you guys here that I actually have let's go to my other account I've set up before this episode I've set up a backend or a database storage and a database storage and authentication so signing in with Google and everything that you would need to actually turn it into an app um if you also want to gather emails or gain users that's all part of this template I don't know if we'll get there today but what I do with repet so this is repet this is what the this is what we run the front end on this is how we deploy the application and we basically connect cursor up to this because cursor it's significantly harder to deploy apps for beginners repet makes taking whatever you've created and putting it on the internet with a domain that you can share right I can share my domain with Greg and he can open the site and use the site and sign in or I can go to name cheep buy a domain and I'll show you that process it takes like 10 seconds and it's hosted directly on rep and so like 20 bucks a month or something you can host a website and get that and Firebase is free until you've reached like a certain amount of users so it's very very cheap now there's like no excuses to uh to not get like an MVP up and vzero what's the cost of like what you did what are we talking v0 is either it's either 15 or 20 bucks a month or something um my AI budget is over ,000 a month so like um I I lost track of the tools um but if you compare that to a front-end designer right $15 a month right what's the hourly rate of a solid designer probably hundreds of dollars per hour um to me it's a no-brainer so this is repet what we need to do is we need to connect it to curser I don't believe I've done that yet so I'm actually going to close out of the project I was working on before and open up a new window and we're just going to do this really quickly uh for anyone who wants to use this template this will actually be cool you can just open the template and you're going to hit use template and this will take you exactly to this page then you're going to go uh then what you're going to do is we're just going to open up Secrets I think I've already done this but you'll have to do this as well and then we're going to also open up SSH and I have more videos on this if I'm going too fast but basically what you need to do is you need to go to keys and we're actually just going to put this aside for now so we're going to leave it open with this Keys tab in cursor you're going to press this button down here to open up the terminal you're going to press command K we're going to type uh generate an SSH key for repet name it repet and copy the public key to my clipboard this seems scary because it is I still don't fully understand what I'm doing but this is how you set it up you're going to press you're going to click on whatever it generates right here right after it enter y enter enter that automatically copies this SSH key that you then add right here I'm going to name it sip then I'm going to hit add key then I'm going to hit connect I'm going to copy this connect manually key and we're going to hit open with SSH we're paste it here we're not going to hit enter we're going to press add new SSH host and we're going to paste it in right here and hit enter we're going to click the top one click connect click continue and then we're almost there you only need to pay attention to this if you actually want to use cursor but cursor is by far the most fun tool I've ever is the best software I've ever used in my life so you're going to want to pay attention you might want to try it okay so then you're going to click on this this should match uh the name of the project which it does sit pod and we're going to hit okay so now they're synced right the template that I made uh with an and he put in the heavy lifting he's a developer repet makes it very easy to share templates and makes it very easy to deploy so you can very quickly download it and you can then write code and create stuff with it the editor on cursor is a lot better so we're BAS basically connecting repet and we're connecting cursor now we've done that now we're just going to we're going to open up the files that we need here so in Source app and we're just going to hit page. TX TSX and this is basically the homepage of this of this template and now we can use the composer which is the feature that is why cursor is going so viral this basically allows us to edit multip Pages at once and so we can then come here and say and we're actually just now building this out so I'm not fully confident this is going to work but I'm going to take a risk here I'm going to say um or I'm going to just say this is a next uh JS app trying to think of how we should do this okay let's do this in order here so I'm going to create a this nextjs app and I want you to um I want you to I just don't know how we want to start like when should we add the AI features to um I'm just going to start off I want you to to uh take the uh take inspiration from and what we're going to do is we're going to use this paths so chat. MD I'll explain this after I do it actually we've used the template to create apps and when we do that success successfully with a certain prompt we add it to the project files so that other people can come here and use inspiration from the files that we've used and so the end game of this would be a blank template where you can create anything but there's kind of 30 paths you can go down of different types of apps whether it's note taking basic chat app um and so let's just say I want you to take inspiration from chat MD and let's create um a basic chatbot where the user will put in a startup idea and you will output the idea in let's go to v0 real quick let's just screenshot this Co copy this nope copy this paste that in um output the idea in text format uh in format in this met with these ideas ignore the styling I don't want to worry about styling until a little bit later I just want to get the AI text feature down so just have uh idea market and internet audiences anytime you deal with AI features it gets tough like this is when you run into a lot of bugs I mean this is a hard thing to create and so the fact that you can do it in just a few bugs is impressive um let's just go ahead and let's just see what it does so I'm going to hit command shift enter which will actually so now it's looking at all of these files which I never told it to use all of these files it's just going through right we can watch it code in the background like it's literally making changes um and telling us exactly what we need to do um now it says npm install open AI Edge okay I hope that's the right install anytime it says install something npm install open AI Edge what you need to do is you need to go to repet and you need to go to your shell and you need to paste that in right here and it does some magic stuff I still don't understand it um it's it's downloading libraries that it needs to do this action so now what we can do is what I'm going to do is I'm going to reset this so I'm going to hit the stop running and then I'm just going to rerun it and then open up the web view in theory the changes will be made after I hit save all um I'm going to hit save all I don't know if it'll be added to the homepage yet we may need to connect it the the app that it just created back to the homepage so I don't know if it's going to change anything anything so I'm going to hit save all okay it is doing something it's hard to tell I don't see any errors okay so now we have this startup idea analyzer after one single prompt and we haven't accepted those changes yet if you're using cursor hit save all instead of accept all accept all is not reversible you have to ask the AI to reverse it instead of just being able to like hit reject I can still hit reject because I hit save all just throwing that out there okay startup idea um let's go ahead and I have a startup idea for selling uh gummy bears at football games what we're testing here is we just want to know if this works right so you just put in a test idea you might want to add one other thing um what other stuff did we have we had the market um football games in Germany just to give it a market okay let's hit analyze idea so what's going through your mind right now yeah so what we've done here is in this template that we're literally making I this is one that we're like in production making and uh this was a good test for me so we have secrets in here so these are all API tokens so we have the opening AI API key the uh replicate API key so these are all tools that you can use on the web that allow you to do cool things right and a popular term is um open AI rapper and what that is is just a software that someone created and it's using open Ai and paying them a little bit every single time it's used so you're hoping that the monthly charges that you're charging people will outweigh the amount you're paying open AI for the usage basically and you can use as many of these different apis and a lot of like a tool light notion is using a ton of different apis if you if it has Google Drive all these different applications but in this case for some reason it's not working so what I'm going to do is literally just tell cursor okay when when I entered my idea into the input field nothing happened need it to generate the uh the output that we discussed and it has context of this so it'll know what you're talking about and I just sometimes add please make this happen or like I don't know you don't have to do that um and I'm just going to hit uh I'm first sometimes you're mean you're mean to to them is that what I I was hearing only when I get mad only when it's like fails 10 times in a row and I'm honest L glad this happened I have talked to there's two types of people whove watched my videos and message me there's the people and it's not nowhere in between either they have fully pushed to the end and created basically a full app that they love or they got stuck on like the first few steps and gave up once you get the aha moment where you're like oh this works and you um and you realize that like you're in charge you don't need to ask anyone like influence you don't need an influencer or a teacher you just need to ask AI you need to ask Claude be like hey it didn't work for this and it might not give you the right answer on the first try but odds are by the second or third try like you will will your way to a working app um it's guaranteed you just have to have I just think it separates the high agency people and the low agency people uh pretty well something I've noticed uh so we're just going to oh I should not have hit accept all but that's I was just going to say you slide devil you it's okay we'll we'll be fine um let's go ahead and refresh this I don't know why there's these like horizontal lines here let's that might be a function of a bad um template prompt so let's just paste in what we had earlier uh which was the gummy bears in Germany can you please use the open AI oh wait hold on uh moment incoming open AI key in your environment variable which we do it's open AI key right it should be called open AI key um it is called open AI key can we please use the I think we should make this an input field first and then use the AI features because we're going to want the AI to fill them in in specific ways well see this is the hard part this is hard to make content on this because you're um okay we need can you please add error logs to the um to the AI input field I have no way of knowing what the problem is fair request is that something you've said before um yeah so I've been doing this a lot well usually you should get an error the most annoying part about this is we're not getting any error it's just literally doesn't say anything um it should say either it should say a host of different things it should either say API is failing because like you have an incorrect API key it should literally just tell us what the problem is um but it's not telling us anything so we need to enter the sends probably going to fail analyze the idea something's wrong I don't know what's going on um hold why is there no error okay I want to change the page we'll we'll add the AI features second because I do want to add that okay I want to change the page um the startup idea analyze to just be an input field and an enter button um for all the fields uh to create um for all the input fields to create a slide that looks like this and what we're going to do is we're going to just paste this in here here is the code that I use to design this card uh based on the input field I want um this to be created for that card okay now I'm going to come over to v0 and I'm just going to I'm just going to paste in here and we'll let it because it needs to recreate it it's not going to use the code because it's already has libraries downloaded so this is fine okay so what's happening I just um I'm changing strategies here so rather than have ai generate out in text form the startup idea in the format that we want instead I'm going to create text input field so we're going to manually put them in and then we can ask AI to take an idea and in the background basically fill those in so we're actually just recreating the process if you don't know to code this is a good way to do it is to actually create it manually and then say I want to automate this process and have that whole process happen in the background so like the user doesn't see it um because I don't really know how there's a whole thing with AI and object creation it's I don't fully understand it so you can use other okay so we need to install this so let's install uh frame or motion so we're going to come over to the um we're going to come over to this right here we're going to go to the Shell because you see npm that means shell we're going to type in shell and we're just going to paste this in like this and so it's installing framer motion and loose side react which is icons I believe um we might have already had both of those downloaded not sure in the template but now I'm going to just stop this rerun it and we're going to open up the web View and let's go ahead and press save all oh brother I did something wrong this is the process oh I know what I can do okay I'm justess going to revert here I really do think we need to do better instructions from the get-go I'm just going to I'm just going to do [Music] it okay good good this is how it should have looked when we were getting errors um because this makes it very easy for us to it says we don't see frame or motion so we can just easily paste in error please advise and fix error messages are good blank screens are bad right this is what should have popped up in the dev log right we should see the the errors right here and it actually knows what to do um and we can actually just see how it reacts so we can hit uh save all and then we're going to refresh um I think it fixed one I think there was multiple errors and now we're only getting I think we're getting I think this will fix oh do I need to add oh I need to add frame or motion okay okay I'm so out of my element right now um still getting this error that's good by the way because most people are out of their element so this is bad for retention you know it's yeah but the real ones are here deep deep in this episode they're with [Music] us now we need to I need to know or now I know that what I need to do is add to the template a basically a v02 repet um uh path so we need to work out these Kinks that I worked out on this podcast or encountered on this podcast and just include it but we're here now so let's go ahead and just accept this now I'm going to hit refresh and what I want to do is we are on let's go to we are in the so we're in Source app page okay so this is what we're on so we want to stay on this page right here I want to be able to edit these on the site the existing page should be the evaluation page this is the final page where I will evaluate all of these startup ideas what I need at the top of the screen or at the top of this page is a an input so it should look identical so I should be able to add these slides in The Identical manner except I want to be able to add my startup idea to one of these cards and then I want to be able to submit it in which it will move to the evaluation stage which is part two let's just try this um okay I feel like there was a little bit of bugs on this part right here cuz like when I hit spit sip I guess that's fine I guess the bar is red um and then yeah it's still kind of buggy but that's okay yeah it's totally okay I mean just having [Music] something we're going to this is a good lesson for anyone still watching um we're going to open up perplexity here and I'm going to say give me the latest uh docks necessary for what I want to do and I'm actually going to say latest API docs for what I want to do I am trying to get open AI um chat GPT to analyze a uh transcript and fill in data based on that because the the docs are going to be different depending on like just a chat versus actually having a structured output um it's actually much more advanced than just like a standard chat bot so yeah perplexity will actually find the latest documentation it's just going to give better instructions we can feed it to cursor which will allow it to make better decisions write better code and that's a really big thing for and oh wait I need this I am using nextjs please recreate and you have to make sure that um so it should give us nodejs I believe okay so here it's giving us the JavaScript yes this looks good so we're just going to copy this whole thing and I'm just going to say here is open AI documentation all right we'll see I I've never done this before actually but I think we could figure it out okay so while we do that I'm have you ever heard of cubby I haven't so I was actually toying with this idea before so uh cubby is like a it likes you can very quickly save um YouTube videos uh and it just automatically copies the transcript and then you can like play it from any point so I can like highlight this part right here and play it from that exact part and you can highlight different parts of it but uh let's just go ahead this is a really long one if I remember okay um I guess let's just let's just see in the first 17 minutes of this one I don't want to get messed up by too long of context so we'll just copy that real quick and we can close that out um now I'm going to hit save and we're going to go to web view okay nice it's coming together please work uh we're gonna paste this in here yeah that looks about like all right so let's see um analyze transcript come on there's no way this works why is open AI giving me like no errors can you change this to anthropic please um give me anthropic anthropics API for the same name use case it looks good though like we have every we have all the shell in place like we have the analyze the transcripts right you could just like literally download your transcript or you could use a transcript API but YouTube's starting to block those like you could automatically once your video is uploaded and your transcript is uploaded it basically just automatically pulls it analyzes it for startup ideas or um I forgot that where we might actually have it just be like your viewers just uploaded but I really wanted this to work see I didn't know you can do that I didn't know you can just change from open AI to anthropic yeah I mean it's it changes the code I mean they have different documentation so like either one we're going to be downloading we use npm install anthropic and it has different rules right but I'm pretty sure I've already I'm just going to do this again just in case I haven't done it um now that I think about it I'm not sure but let's go to Secrets new secret value um paste that in so this is a next this is what's different than the normal projects that I've been creating why is this giving me no API errors nothing I want to at least know what the problem is so it's so cool it's kind of like you're you're talking to your engineer friend and they're helping you yes and the more experience you have clearly I'm out of my element because two days ago was the first time I tried nextjs and so I had a previous template that I was using with just react react and typescript and the reason we switched is because you had to set up the a full SE separate repet for a backend API but it was actually I understand it a lot better uh so like when you enter a new territory which I am right now with nextjs you get caught up because you don't know what the problem is because I haven't been dealing with nextjs problems as much um anthropic API key yes we have all that in there um let's just hit save all analyze transcript just give me an error please see this this actually lets you solve the problem we got an error so ask it to find a way to give you an error which is called error logging I think um and I'm just going to paste in this error please fix this problem insane that you can do that it's fun but it's annoying it's so annoying um and you it sometimes it leads to nothing so you got to carve out like two two or three hour more time than you think you need at first and then eventually you'll get better once you've mastered and if we just use like Python and we didn't care about how good it looks it would be much easier to create because python is very straightforward and AI is very good at creating it it just wouldn't create those you can't use v0 for python like using like it's just not compatible um okay so let's just hit um save all um let me see see here okay now let's see what the issue is um what's interesting about subcategory on Amazon analyze transcripts sending transcript for analysis see now we have better logging we can actually see what's happening here okay we're getting another error um and I'm going to ask first can you please tell me if this is the same error as last time uh if it uh and give me some more information on that then fix the error please I just want to know and we're going to run it [Music] again okay we'll try one more time please make sure that the anthropic um API response is properly parsed and be lenient I really want this to work so just make this work if this doesn't work we'll try what I said previously because I think that would work because I think it's coming through it's just failing to parse it we needed to plea with it h we needed to plea with it we needed you got personal with it yeah we need to negotiate we need yeah I'm pretty sure it's anthropic API key yeah um let's hit save all oh is this correct was that one of the ideas they talked about in the episode yeah I I can't believe I actually can't believe it it works I literally canot believe that that's one of what's a lit RP what's a lit RPG lit RPG is just this yeah literature role playing game it's like a very Niche audience that this guy Nicholas cold was talking about that there's huge opportunity to create books for and were these things that you guys talked about or is it using AI to guess wait this actually kind of cool I might use um I'm pretty sure we talked about it and did you use 250,000 per month I'm just trying to figure out what the AI is guess okay so it's literally summarizing it nice yeah okay summarizing yeah um actually I don't know I don't know if we said 250 we might have said like a 100 and I see to the side it says projected Market size by 2028 so maybe it like put some you know compound annual growth rate to it no it's good it's good you have to play with it um it's good to know which where it's um wait and so okay so okay so we can add new idea so that added the idea okay now I want for um because if we were doing it on the old template I would know how to set it up so users could literally go to a site called Greg sippers spit. comom and they could sign in and upload their ideas and then you would once you hit like you could hit like show all and then you could like go through them and see like Sheila said that had this and you could literally turn it into a segment in your podcast but I don't know how to do it with this new template um but I will get that um H let's open back up cubby let's see what happens here so let's go later in the episode and let's just grab you guys talked about multiple oh three startup ideas okay wait whoa oh it just did two in that one I think yeah it did wait so Niche Publishing House sip yeah AI powered Niche Publishing House a publishing company that uses AI to generate 80% of Niche genre books with human writers to finish the last 20% is that one you talked about okay um spit only this isn't real is it the only fans Creator book Partnerships partnering with only fans creat I think we might have said that yeah really okay damn okay well then did this might just work actually wait I think we might reach a context limit here I saved let's go to different one here let's just grab all of them um this one is the same one what's a shorter one five validated startup ideas okay so we're just going to do the first half of this one because I think we're going to get cut off actually it is anthropic it might be able to just do all of them let's see let's just see if we get an error come on no way all right it just works let's go I am so thank God I was feeling the pressure wait so now let's just change this to spit real quick okay Facebook reals optimization tool it sounds about about right wait this one was with I think I actually watched this one Oh no just kidding yeah this is this is this was yes this is from this episode Chris he did talk I just want to make sure this is right so he did talk about this okay uh let's sip this programming SEO agency franchise yes okay AI content repurposing tool that's right yes lifetime warranty product yeah all these things all right this is is working we can just go through and grab all your uh podcasts and just like see all the ideas um all right um and we won't have time for it today but couldn't you automate that yes yeah that would take a little I mean then we would need to um there's I mean that's a that's a really valuable thing and if you want to create something of value yeah it would probably take me another two hours plus another a while to debug and like I might actually need help to fully deploy it properly because that's a really hard thing like you're basically scraping transcripts then you are putting it through this process you're then saving them and um I mean actually if we had another hour I'm sure we could figure it out but let's just paste this in and let's hit analyze transcript com comment on YouTube uh if you want Riley to come back some other time if if he'll bless us do you know this one uh wait I'm just curious on which one this is see this this feels like a Cody Schneider just like looking at the transcript oh damn this just got I just uploaded this an hour and 22 minute episode and it got it went from 8 to 15 so let's just see what this looks like full screen so this is the app startup idea evaluator you paste in your transcript and then um yeah so then this is this one so you have a LinkedIn video content Agency for Founders um the AI automation Consulting for small businesses I don't know if you talked about that I'm pretty sure these are all yes okay nice all right this works um o formatting gets a little rough after after 10 but that's fine that's easily fixable yeah um yeah dude I feel like send me your invoice I feel like after this I owe you $100,000 from this n dude I'll uh I'll figure out how to deploy it we'll um I'll just like send you the the link you can use it amazing um so Greg we're about an hour and 15 minutes after we finished uh the episode but I've added the ability to just paste in a link and we can hit load transcript then I can actually type in what I want to look for so startup ideas so I kind of turn this into a general app something that I might use to analiz a transcript and maybe look for AI news or coding ideas or something along those lines but we can just paste this in and hit analyze transcript should load any second now boom so four uh total ideas extracted and now what we can do um and I just put jot like jot it down or not right instead of sip or spit now we can click this button and it actually saves it right up here so this is sponsorship Library tool and we can hit jot and we see it up here sponsorship Library tool and then if we don't want it we can hit not and we have now all done so it's kind of a full app experience I think right where we ended the episode was right when it starts to get fun because you can actually start making um smaller changes and now we can save these to your profile we could in theory add the ability to edit them so you can refine them and kind of into a little notebook of your startup ideas that you have sipped or spit it is 7:41 and we've added another update so this is where we're at now we can officially sign in uh if I refresh the page here you can see it uh but it automatically takes you to my profile the app works as normal except now we can see all sips so we can see all of them and so now every single video that we do so now if we do interesting ideas and I paste it in another transcript from Greg uh hit load transcript uh analyze transcript uh what this will do it should load in the SE all sips as this interesting idea is here so what we can do is we can hit uh so let's just sip so now there's five interesting ideas from this one so sip sip you know what let's spit this one and we'll sip this one and so we go through all those now we can see all sips so now we have interesting ideas in here where do you want to leave people you know they've watched this and there was UPS there were downs but we ended up in a high like what do you want what's one piece of advice you want to give to people yeah okay so uh I guess um I have never claimed to be an expert at this right I love learning like I love like the act of like learning things and like diving deep into rabbit holes and I'm actually just this why I've partnered with an who's very good at uh at what he does and he's an expert developer he is a senior developer in every sense he's started companies and so we're working together and we're going to try and create a community and eventually help a million people learn how to code without having to write how uh uh learning how to write code and by the time you watch this I think it's going to be software composers tocom right now it's senior uh senior s uh see the fact that I don't even know we Lally bought the domain yesterday and threw the community up and we've uh it's called software composers senior software composers and since the tool that you just saw me using was composers uh was the composer feature incursor and you're kind of just composing your way uh figuring out your way through the bugs and so we're basically just creating a community of people who want to do that we're going to be releasing very in-depth course uh in-depth courses that I'm basically going to take and and then everything that I learn I'm going to put out step by step and we're going to do weekly calls help people through their bugs and every person who joins the uh the software composers is going to get like weekly help with their projects every single person's going to create an app fully deploy it we're going to talk about stripe integration which I'm really excited about actually monetizing these apps which is actually one of the hardest parts of apps especially if you have like multiple different plans um but we're GNA talk about all of it so that's what I'm working on I'm joining like I I'll definitely join once it's live I for me all this stuff like curse or repet all these new tools like it's about getting your hands dirty and it's about you know treating it as like a creative process like even if you don't end up you know yes some of these businesses some of these projects can turn into businesses and who knows like create real wealth and everything but sometimes it's just fun to do this and and to like like you said solve problem so thanks for coming on here and uh I'll see you uh I'll see you next time yeah see you appreciate it this was a lot of fun I'm thank god it worked at the end there thank god it worked dude imagine didn't worked that would have that would have sucked there would have been no it was it would have been a buildup to nothing so thank god it worked I had I had fun doing that so yeah and if you like this sort of stuff like this on YouTube to get more of this in your feed and subscribe [Music]

Title: The step by step guide to starting a business from $0
Published: 2024-08-29 15:00:43 UTC
Description:
I’m joined by Adam Robinson who has bootstrapped startups to $20M+ ARR as we deep dive on how we would validate and grow a startup idea.

1) The Yonder Phone Pouch market is exploding
• Locks phones away to create "phone-free spaces"
• Already in schools, concerts, comedy shows
• Huge potential for innovation (charging, remote unlock, etc.)
• Adam predicts 98% of middle schools will require in 10 years

2) How to validate & launch a Yondr competitor:
• Target affluent customers first (Elon approach)
• Have 100s of conversations before building
• Look for "eyes lighting up" as signal
• Prototype only after strong validation

3) Growth strategy: Micro-influencer UGC
• Outreach to 1000s of relevant micro-influencers
• Send free product, ask for honest posts if they like it
• No monetary incentives needed for authentic content
• Aim for breadth of coverage, not mega-influencers

4) Copywriting Framework
• Study successful brands in similar space (e.g. Jolie)
• Use AI (Claude, ChatGPT) to adapt their style
• Remember: Don't copy, but get inspired and make it your own

5) The "third way" of building startups:
• Combine Rework's bootstrapping principles with Y Combinator's focus on product excellence
• Result: Profitable growth without VC dependency
• If product is truly excellent, word-of-mouth drives growth

here here's what a Yonder phone pouch is it's this contraption that basically prevents you from accessing your phone which is the greatest drug on Earth I I just have this incredibly high level of conviction that some sort of locking phones away is going to be a part of kids Futures you know and and a lot of other environments too and here's where I think the potential for Innovation is there's a huge opportunity to like identify an elegant feature set around this pouch that just makes it work a lot better if you were going to create you know Yonder 2.0 or Yonder for XYZ Niche how would you actually go about doing [Music] so Adam Robinson you've made it to the startup ideas podcast yes this is the highlight of my career this is literally it's only downhill from here I'm so excited to be here I feel like I'm on a Mountaintop by the way I was on a Mountaintop all of last week I was in the woods in Colorado sitting like a monk basically reflecting on life I was n getting nature therapy you like really achieve deep inner peace if you're totally unplugged and in solitude it happens to everyone we live like that for a million years before we uh were evolved to do that you know um but it's just hard for people like us right you're busy you have you know family maybe or whatever and it's like uh maybe later maybe when my kids are older and then you never do it so I just keep doing it and it's like so great because it actually helps you with the time with your kids that's how to prioritize it so anyway so you were on that Mountaintop you were brainstorming startup ideas you decided you decide to text me we're now here and and I'm ecstatic because you're the real deal you've built I mean you've built businesses from zero to 20 million ARR completely bootstrap so when you talk I listen that's rare yeah not many people end up doing that for a lot of reasons which we agree are stupid some of them you know exactly exactly so um let's just let's just get into it you know what's on your mind right now and and what could you share with with people so look I um you know to this nature theme right like we lived in the woods for a million years and then a couple thousand years ago we started Living in cities which pulled our brains in a totally different direction that we not physically evolved to be in then 150 years ago the Industrial Revolution happened and for a large part of the population it really made them live in a crappy environment then connectivity happened whenever it was 10 years ago which is literally the worst so the Yonder phone patch exists for a lot of reasons right like this device is like fentanyl for us and it's so powerful that we've literally had to create a pouch to like go in and respect a comedian for instance and actually listen otherwise we'd just be on our phones you know getting our monkey mind whipped around by like whatever uh alert or text message that doesn't matter from someone uh that we receive so I think this like take this device that I know is absolute Kryptonite for my well-being and like put it in a place where idiot proof this like put it in a place where I can't touch it is like a massive market for the future and it's very and it's infancy you know H how many schools have a Yonder patch set like hardly any my guess is in 10 years 98% of middle schools are requiring people to put their phone in a pouch and lock it during the day that's my guess so there's probably people who don't even know what a Yonder pouch is yeah yeah okay okay so so here here's what a Yonder phone pouch is and I hope that I'm going to inspire a lot of innovation out there because the Yonder foam patch only works in one way right which I think is the the TR tremendous opportunity because there's a lot of people who would prefer it to not work in this way so if you go in Austin like if you go to Joe Rogan's comedy place called the mothership as you walk in the door they literally require you to take your phone out of your pocket put it in this pouch then they touch the pouch to a device that locks the pouch and you cannot open the pouch until you touch it to that device again so your phone's there you're holding it but you can't access it so you it requires you to be you know it just helps you pay attention to the actual in participate in the environment that you're in right so that's the application for a comedy show you could see the application for movies and theaters education I mean I just read this book called The anxious generation which I would highly recommend reading uh it's it's by the guy who wrote the coddling of the American mind I mean these these cell phones are just terrible for for middle schoolers you know everybody's getting them earlier and earlier my buddy runs a charter school here in Austin I'm like is there a chance that by the time my two-year-old is in Middle School the parents will have agreed to have not given them smartphones he's like no shot there's always one that will because we're getting to the point where everybody had smartphones when they were young who are having kids now so uh so anyway that's what it is it's this contraption that basically prevents you from accessing your phone which is the greatest drug on Earth and here's where I think the potential for Innovation is this device this the Yonder pouch which I'm sure is just growing exponentially right I don't know but like I I just have this incredibly high level of conviction that some sort of locking phones away is going to be a part of kids Futures you know and and in a lot of other environments too the pouch Works in one way it's a very you know kind of 20th century device if you want to call it that it's very not Tech it's just like it kind of like works like the theft things in retail stores you touch it to that device it locks you touch it again it unlocks right like if if you have a 2,000 person High School the practicality of that is not really great I think there's like kind of like what Elon did to the car there's a huge opportunity to like identify an elegant feature set around this pouch that probably is not that much more expensive than the just what they're doing right now that just makes it work a lot better like oh it charges your phone wallets in there or you know it uh like uh the the the principal of the entire school when the bell goes off hits unlock and all the kids can like get into their phones without literally queuing up you know for a half hour to walk out of the building to like tap their device on this thing shh don't tell anyone but I've got 30 plus startup ideas that could make you millions and I'm giving them away for free these aren't just random guesses they're validated Concepts from entrepreneurs who built hundred million plus businesses I've compiled them into one one simple database compiled from hundreds of conversations I've had on my podcast but the main thing is most of these ideas don't need a single investor some cost nothing to start I'm pretty much handing you a cheat sheet the idea bank is your startup shortcut just click below to get access your next cash flowing business is waiting for you I I am F if I were not doing what I was doing I would be like digging around I don't I would be digging a rabbit hole on this device keep my phone away from me market for sure yes because we're going to want that more and more and I think more and more people acknowledge that we don't have the power to do it ourselves right so from a scale perspective from what I heard Yonder was doing like 30 to 40 million in Revenue they've got over a million students every day using the product in 21 countries which is crazy um that costs about $25 to $30 USD per student um another interesting thing is I just checked um Google Trends and I use this tool called Glimpse that adds some search data on top of it the some of the top searches for Google trends for Yonder is Yonder stock how do I invest Y inv in Yonder is y publicly traded which is a really good signal that uh people believe in the company so if you were going to create you know Yonder 2.0 or Yonder for XYZ Niche how would you actually go about doing so I would probably take the Elon approach and make a fancy one for rich people first you know like I just feel like rich people are also very aware of this problem a lot of them and like you can have you have access to them through social media so like I mean this is literally what I would do I would just start talking I would whenever I was around my more affluent friends who have kids I would just start talking to them about this and I would probably buy a Yonder and show it to them and then I would be like what if this could do X Y and Z right you know and then I'd work on what the x y and z was after l i mean hundreds of conversations I would not build anything until I could say XYZ and I would get like literal eyes light up asking me where they could buy it and then I would start prototyping something physical I would do an enormous amount of because man it's like prototyping is expensive you can save a lot of Heartache through talking I don't think people really understand that who have not started several companies before you know Uh something's happening to me right now which is this great example of like not talking enough like we're building this other feature for rb2 and we built a tangential feature first we built an ICP filter an ideal customer profile filter first and didn't really talk to people we thought we knew what they wanted we didn't think about the fact that like okay so like if if you filter down by ICP in LinkedIn you're filtering a an 800 million contact database yep so a restrictive ICP filter makes sense a lot of our customers we resolve 10 contacts a day if they put a restrictive ICP filter which is like and instead of or it's going to give them zero to one contacts like per month you know what I mean so so but we defaulted to the end right so I asked and we didn't realize this to like I asked the people who are trying to beta test this other feature to set it up and then we're like oh my God like 10 out of 10 people the way we built this are doing something that like we would want to nudge them the other way and the first reaction is like oh it's fine like you know support can explain it or whatever but it's like no if it's 98% of people that we want to nudge one way like we want support to explain to the 2% why anyway so um you know I just keep learning that lesson over and over again uh but but that is literally what I would do I would just go go start talking to people and then there's a bunch of interesting tangential kind of like if you can get people to unplug and disconnect for a few days universally people feel like it's an incredible experience so if you can start like uh you know renting these summer camps in the fall in the Northeast and like you know having family experiences or like you know people in their 20s can like you know bring 30 people there or whatever like I'm just so interested in getting people away from their phones and I think that like more and more every day people acknowledge how terrible this ongoing you know onslaught of of uh you know our lives now right like you and I are we're in it dude like we're you know we we're the worst victims and perpetrators of this uh of problem how do you know I wasn't just checking Twitter right now how do you know I was on Twitter this whole conversation yeah it's like uh I talked to these guys one time in in in uh LA and they're like yeah we like help apps become more addictive and we also have a consulting firm that that helps the platform make the pl platform less addictive right you know so they're like causing the problem on one end and then they're like helping you know consult with Android about how you can like layer the black and white on or whatever you know they're both sides you both sides they're like Grey Goose but they're also Alcoholics Anonymous yeah totally that but I guess if you understand the problem that well you can you can help both sides totally totally so I'm on the under website and I see something I like seeing which is if you go to the under it they have a bunch of different categories so it says uh first of all their tagline of phone free spaces like perfect really really well said so elegant so elant by the way like like anytime you can get a super clear statement that's like under five words yes that really captures the essence of what you're trying to do like that is totally magic three words is the goal if you can get it to three words God bless you so so with rbb real quick like y with with there there's like this weird thing where we're identifying website traffic but everybody does it different and the right visitors from us are not the right visitors from somebody else so my tagline use us too I like that yeah like that beautiful right yeah that's really good that that's really good so on the on the Yonder website Pham free spaces you got homes all these categories home school music comedy events and weddings courts workpl uh Productions hospitality and other what that says to me whenever I see something like that I'm like okay how do I create Yonder for X yeah so totally totally I think going to your point like if you can uh like mock up some of these landing pages mock up the products for x and then just start talking those people that's a great approach the other thing I usually do also to your point is once I see categories I'm like okay these are categories but what's a what's a group of people that I would go Target that has specific needs for this thing so yes you know Yonder for rich people uh Yonder for uh you know you know Wellness people or or whatever just you know going down the list and uh and then seeing is there something unique that you can provide to them totally like surely I look at that and I don't know what it is yet because I haven't had the conversations yeah but what I do know is that one dumb device is not the best it's not the best for all of those different applications it's like 80% there for all of them it's not 100% for any of them it might be 100% for one of them which is where they started and then they realized it was 80% for the other 15 or whatever right so like the way I love thinking about it is like I saw this thing that a VC made one time that was like Craigslist and then it was like all of the startups that have been started since Craigslist that have taken a slice of Craigslist this is like to me this is like that that's the story of startups it's like yanders Craigslist go make right you know one and then like other slices of like either a smarter or a dumber or like a whatever you know whatever musicians need that like you know hospitals don't or whatever I just think there's huge opportunity and and and when my buddy who runs a charter school is literally saying what the top search volume is he's like I don't know much about this stuff but like if you can get in on Yonder somehow like this is going to be in every school in America in 10 years like this this idea right like uh and I understand why they're I couldn't imagine something that is like interferes with learning more than a student having a smartphone on their desk that's right and literally like maybe like when I was in Middle School and raging hormones like a naked woman in front of me would have been worse but like not by much you know I think you're totally right I think there's also an opportunity when a market gets really big there's just an opportunity to be a me too and if you just uh innovate on like your $ Five Doll less or your black you know your red red and black you know just a color color way yeah totally that could also be enough so you're a I would consider you a growth guy or marketing guy if you were going to create Yonder for rich people let's just say you did some you did some quick testing people are like yeah that's something I want if it looked like a I don't know really dope cigar high-end Cigar Case I would totally buy that for $799 799 instead of1 149 or 249 which Yonder charges how would you go about actually growing the thing I would do what Ryan banzan at Jolie did and I would do a micro to medium influencer ugc strategy and I would start before I had the device it's manual so so by the way I'm not trying to like promo my stuff or whatever but like I had this guy and there's this app there's this bdb app called clay who's also massive ugc motion I had the two of them on my weekly live show a few weeks ago and it was unbelievable a lot of it was unintuitive and the the the they were saying the exact same thing that they did right to grow this B2B app with Legion agencies and to grow a showerhead business with micro influencers it was the exact there saying the same words guys don't overthink this it's literally just Outreach right like we you know we had a novel thing and like these people tried it and liked it and they made content about it right so I would um I would pick a few thousand influencers who kind of like had either either were talking about things related to health and mental health or you know they're they they have an audience like the subject matter are things that are like tangentially interest interesting to affluent people um and I would go after them and I would say I have this pouch if I send you one for free and you like it would you post about it if you don't like it throw it away but if you think it's dope post about it right and with interpace social media in the randomness of Tik Tok or whatever it's like if you get enough of that going uh you know one out of every couple hundred goes viral like basically what bin was saying he's like before we started this uh we were trying to come up with like how do you create a stream of traffic that was the volume of paid but the quality of organic and that is what I would do it it's a it's basically a cold calling thing so by the way those guys got this showerhead business Jolie to 50 million run rate in 36 months with three people they just hired their fourth full-time employee they have double digigit free cash generation off of this physical product business they send a $99 filter every year to people who buy the showerhead that does not get canceled has 93% gross churn 19 million ARR with like 95% margin of filters right it's like one of the most beautiful businesses I've ever heard of uh and and if you're like what's the strategy he's like it's all inbound now they all come to us but like in the beginning it was outbound ugc that was the only thing that we did so that's what I would do and you don't need to incentivize these people like it's it's really as simple as just sending them the product and being like if you like it look here's the thing uh this is what I Ryan's a great entrepreneur he's a second timer he sold a shoe business to Steve Madden uh he waited for years before he started another company because he was looking for the perfect combination of Financial and product principles to build a product around and then his skin was drying out and he's like oh the shower head it's perfect it's you know one size fits all it's like whatever it's not susceptible to Fashion which was like killing him about this the inventory management is not a problem and um he he's basically like what you know it's a they're ugly it's a there's no Brand Story around showerheads so he he just saw saw the opportunity there and the product is very good we have one if you have a great product that is good enough to have Word of Mouth there are 1,000 things in the world that you can do to speed it up this ugc thing would be one of them the problem is it's hard to get a product that's good enough to get word of mouth but my thing is you need to keep talking to people until their eyes light up because their eyes lighting up is a sure indication that if they get it in their hand delivered as you promised they will tell somebody else right so like is this going to work if you have something like the product of the first company that I started 14 years ago no because the product wasn't good enough but like I have this company rbb now we have an incredible ugc strategy because like the product is so good and so hot that these Legion agencies when they post about it it does more for them than posting about anything else right so like that's my point it's like both of them said this it's like they did not incentivize these people with money at all not $1 right and that's why that what they also said was it's about the breadth of the coverage of the audiences rather than going to one person and they were like one person who had a massive audience like Kardashian or whatever they're like they both had this view they're like those people are way overpaid they haven't really helped the brands at all and uh the wayed think about it is if you were going to pay rather than paying $500,000 for one post you should pay $500 for a thousand posts from small people right like so those are just some kind of like core principles of getting it to work because I would hope that with the experience that I have that I wouldn't even be at that point unless I was like I know that rich people want this because they're asking me where they can buy it right and then like I get the Prototype I hand it to them and they're like other people are then coming to me who know them and saying how do I get this right at that point I would start the ugc Outreach and I'd be like here's what's coming you know good sales copy if I get you one and you like it you know will you make content about it and if you don't like it will will you throw it away right like quick ad break let me tell you about a business I invested in it's called boring marketing so a few years ago I met this group of people that were some of the best SEO experts in the world they were behind getting some of the biggest companies found on Google and the secret sauce is they've got a set of technology and AI that could help you outrank your competition so for my own businesses I wanted that I didn't want to have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I didn't want to depend on ads to drive customers to my businesses I wanted to rank high in Google that's why I like SEO and that's why I use boring marketing.com and that's why I invested in it they're so confident in their approach that they offer a 30-day Sprint with 100% money back guarantee who does that nowadays so check it out highly recommend foring marketing.com someone's going to listen to this and be like yeah but I can't write copy as well as you ad him and I think a really easy way to do it is if you find another product that has great sales copy like say Jolie like go and sign up buy a Jolie for example um just study their their copy map out their funnel and then just go to go to Claude or go to chat gbt and be like hey this is what I'm trying to write for this product I want it to be in the style of Jolie because I like it for the following reasons could you take a first stab at it yeah totally and um I think look you can't copy people that doesn't work if you copy people you'll get like 1% of what they're doing that's my deep belief uh it takes people a long time to learn that took me a long time to learn that it took me years to learn that like copying I don't know why it took me that long I don't know why I didn't like I just didn't appreciate the kind of artistry of being an entrepreneur and like the fact that the world doesn't want something that's the same it wants something new but like taking a lot from what's working over here and applying it over here does work you know what I mean like what came to my mind immediately is like I went to Bhutan on a trip in 2011 and they're drinking this like butter tea which was like so good and then a few years later I start seeing this Bulletproof Coffee and it's like the same idea it's like this dude was in Nepal drinking this butter tea and he's like oh if you put that in coffee it kind of does the same thing it has this like really makes your body feel really cool and I didn't even know that that was a back story until like a year ago and like that's literally what happened if every single person in Nepal and Bhutan is drinking tea a certain way then there are definitely a ton of people in America who do the same thing and if you're a great Storyteller game over right like but all that stuff like I wasn't a good copywriter 14 years ago you know like like but like you said I was just like looking at stuff that I was like man like what about that do I think is so amazing and then like how could I just like adapt it to what I'm trying to do you know um and and I think that's what all the greats do right like it's like steal like an artist there's this great book called steal like an artist it's like if you take from one person you're plagiarist if you take from 20 people you're an artist right you just kind of have to do it that way and then I think the longer you're in the game the more you develop your own true style and the less you're doing that you know like I'm not really looking at stuff anymore when I write copy but man I've been been doing this a long time totally you know totally yeah I think uh what you can steal is not the individual recipe but like the D you know the break the the direction of the recipe so for example um you know one of my favorite websites is on.com Jason Fred's um company and it's just beautiful Manifesto around how they see the world and how things have changed and all that I'm not saying go in like copy ones.com but you can what you can copy is the recipe of like a Manifesto and and and you know a main character having uh encountering problems and stuff like that and apply it to whatever it is you know you're trying to do cuz CU recipes like that don't really change like human beings don't really change and it's really just about adapting that to whatever it is you're doing beautifully said thank you sir yeah these guys love being different you know um they love being different but like did they invent the manifesto probably not right yeah yeah yeah yeah I by the way like the the these guys were like one of the most influential you know I sort of read 4H hour work so I worked as a Trader at Leman Brothers for 10 years the day I arrived in Manhattan my roommate Jake lodwick was building Vimeo on a Dreamweaver instance baby blue homepage big letters and he's like I think I'm going to make this thing that shares video with PE I was just like why would you do that you know like no we we didn't have smartphones like it was it was 2003 2005 no four anyway um so that made me want to be an entrepreneur I was a Trader for 10 years and when you're a tra when you're like it's really hard to describe the life how much of a grind it was like I was getting up at 445 in the morning because the gyms were I had to get to work at 6 gyms were not open until like 5:30 whatever I was running across the Brooklyn Bridge on the coldest day of the winter at 4:45 in the morning in Manhattan every single day because I wanted to work out uh and that you know putting a tie on like getting on the subway like it was just brutal um and then financial crisis happened I had a good year then a bad year and then I got fired because I lost a money a lot of money at once but I've saved some dough I was like okay what do I do now I don't want to do that anymore you know and I think I've got enough money to like transition this to something else and if not I'll just go get another I go back right like but I was on the clock and you read 4H hour work week after you've lived out life for 10 years and it's like he was writing to me he said that he was writing to somebody one of his friends who was an investment banker right and it's like this idea that like if you're making a lot of money and you're living that way that's not actually good making far less money for far far far less output is actually a much better position to be in and like there's a lot of ways to control your expenses and then you have this free time to do you know whatever you want presumably you know just the way he thought about time versus money was like a massive paradigm shift and then I read rework and I was like holy this is it you know like this is the direction that I want to go in and then my first startup basically ended up being a rework business it was like 3 million AR 50% profit I had two co-founders but it was like in email marketing business in the customer account was shrinking by a percent a month but like it's it's a a good it's a high a low term product category as net revenue expansion because like you're charging People based on their list size and they don't switch that much because it's like where the data is being stored so it was kind of just stably at 3 million AR but like at some point it was going to end which was not a great space to be in and then I think the perfect combination is is like rework fundamentals but why combinator orientation towards W growth if you can think about product Market fit and growth from the Y combinator lens which I really don't think rework emphasizes that much they're not I'm not sitting there reading the rework book and being like I need to strive to have a truly excellent product that has incredible word of mouth before I even take anything to Market that's not the vibe that I get from that the vibe that I get from yator is it's all about your product it will solve all of your problems the reason you're going to get burnt out is because it's not growing more the reason it's not growing is because the product's not good enough like if you kind of marry those two ideas I think you can be in this like perfect world of Entrepreneurship where it's like you have enough conviction to Stave off VCS and uh in you know whatever not go down that path that's like stacked against you horribly but you still have the understanding that your entire life is only going to be as good as the product that you sell like that's just the reality you know uh and I don't think those rework guys emphasize that enough so maybe I'll be the guy who sort of comes out with this uh you know religion about how you know well Jason freed was spoton the why combinators are spot on in many ways but like they missed the mark in some there's this there's the Third Way totally well I thought you know I was listening to that I was like maybe I'll be the guy too yeah no I think we're really aligning the way we think about right cuz my whole thing is like look if you have a chance of making a big company that would require Venture Capital it's going to be because you have a great product if you have a great product you really shouldn't need Venture Capital unless it's a really Capital heavy business right like if you're like doing vertical takeoff and Landing helicopters like the you know one of my friends from New York right like you're going to need to raise hundreds of Milli millions of dollars to experiment with that and then to roll it out you're going to need to raise billions but like software strangely it's like uh the it is the lightest thing to create but we have had the lowest standards for profitability right because just the multiple thing and what we can go faster whatever um I personally believe there's like ways to structure pricing and go to market to where it kind of offsets the need for Capital to build huge teams to go distribute it you know and I also think bigger teams move slower that's kind of a counter a counterintuitive thing anyway dude that's the Pod there you go that's literally the Pod mic drop yeah thanks for uh thanks for coming on uh where could uh people learn more about about you yeah I hope that I'm as big as you on Twitter someday I haven't actually had time to focus on it uh linkedin's where I'm at I make a lot of stuff almost every day I'm I I like have a very an incredibly transparent you know Journey sharing thing going on there uh I tell it the good and the Bad and the Ugly So Adam Robinson on LinkedIn if you want to email me Adam at retention. comom I'll respond um yeah man uh rbtb.com if you want to figure out who's on your website and get their LinkedIn profiles it's free uh that's that's what I'm up to these days damn and I like how you gave the email you know people your email is about to blow up sweet yeah that's cool and dude you should you totally could create a system that takes your LinkedIn content and just in a in a elegant way moves it to X but that's a story I got to you know we we got to talk about that yeah I'd love to talk anytime anytime I I just am such a Believer so now that I have a large social media presence and I am in a position where I am respected in the startup ecosystem as someone who knows what they're doing I will never start a business without that right you know what I mean like I was talking to one of my co-founders because we have this other business that like sells to e-commerce and it's so hard because outbounds getting so hard and it's like what do we even do to like create awareness and generate leads and stuff and I was like dude like now that I have this founder brand stuff like I feel like starting a business that sells to anyone other than people in SAS given this audience that I have would be like the Kardashians starting a lipstick and being like we're we are not using Instagram nope we're gonna go do the we're gonna create a brand that doesn't involve us and we're going to pay a bunch for ads and we're going to start from zero it's like just it's just the biggest superpower of all time to create organic content that people like so I would encourage anyone listening if this is still rolling to start today trying to find your voice because once you do it's G to open up doors you never knew ex totally and going back to your Yonder idea it's like if I was going to start that idea I'd start with a Tik Tok account and Instagram somewhere build build content around phone phone free spaces is go you know review Phone free spaces phone free like get at phone free experiences on Instagram or whatever it is yeah um so it's a good place to start not just for personal but for as I always think about it as like my minimal viable product is my my Social account yeah so yep Adam I'll catch you later and uh maybe on a mountain top somewhere all right man thanks for having me on Greg thank you [Music] Downy

Title: 5 validated startup ideas that will make you money
Published: 2024-08-27 17:17:59 UTC
Description:
I’m joined by Chris Koerner who owns 8 RV parks + 7 companies, as we jam on 5 ideas he would start tomorrow:

1) Content Management for underserved platforms 

• Instagram Reels can be cross-posted to Facebook
• FB Reels get massive organic reach (100k+ views/hr)
• Clickable links allowed in comments (unlike IG)
• Opportunity: Build a tool/agency to automate this for creators

2) Programmatic SEO Franchise

• Use tools like Zapier, TagParrot, Whalesync to create 1000s of local landing pages
• Target undersaturated home services niches
• Sell as a "business in a box" for $10k + monthly fee
• Cheaper than a franchise, potentially huge ROI

3) Viral-Content Finder

• Content often goes viral on one platform, unknown on others
• AI could scan for viral content in your niche across platforms
• Automatically repurpose & post to your accounts
• Bonus: Add viral potential prediction feature

4) "Lifetime Warranty" DTC Brand 

• Inspired by Shady Rays ($130M sunglasses brand)
• Offer lifetime replacements, factor cost into pricing
• Apply to other niches: flip flops, accessories, etc.
• Key: High margins + emotional connection to product

5) Shopify Abandoned Cart Call Center 

• Human outreach converts WAY better than automated messages
• Target high AOV Shopify stores (100$+)
• Offer no upfront cost, take % of recovered sales

like what's the scale of a of a big Le genen business they can easily get to be eight figure multiple eight figures in Revenue especially if they're in a profitable Niche um so I think the the thesis that Facebook is only for people over 65 which is basically in our world we're kind of like that's that's what Facebook is isn't necessarily true the long and short of it is if you have a Shopify store there's a zillion Shopify apps third party tools that will help you increase your abandoned cart and abandoned checkout rate automated SMS emails you know Shopify has their own uh Native solution to this but the best converting um fix for abandoned checkout or abandoned cart they're two different things is to get a person on the phone this is a gift that you're giving people that this exists that there's this is like an Arbitrage opportunity there's also an agency idea here um where I think the tagline could be something [Music] like and we are live Chris Kerner you're on the Pod thank God thank God because you are an idea machine you you own eight RV parks you own seven companies and you're constantly sharing ideas with the world I needed to have you on the startup ideas podcast and you said yes absolutely I needed to be here this is this is where I get my energy this is like my caffeine this is uh this is your people you're G to get a lot of comments on YouTube and stuff like that and people are gonna be like that Chris guy yeah he's one of us yes I hope so I hope so yeah all right so you have a list of ideas let's start from the top and uh let's give it to the people give them some actionable tactical ideas each one of these ideas are are better than the next um so let's let's get right into it okay so you might need to build on this first one because it's it's it's uh 40% baked so I just started posting Instagram reels for the first time in my life a few months ago it's a whole new world to me and you know in the Instagram settings you can check the little toggle button that says cross post to Facebook I'm like yeah what the heck so I started a Facebook page zero followers cross posted and then one day I log in there and it's like wow some of these videos are really getting a lot of views and so as an afterthought I commented on my own thing and I I shied all my links to all my things and people started clicking I used tracking links so then I had a video start going viral and it was getting like a 100,000 views an hour or so and I was like oh let me do that again let me put my links in there because in Instagram key differentiator you can there are no clickable links in the comments on Facebook there are and so I put in all my links and then literally within seconds I refreshed my uh what a tiny URL and I was getting dozens of clicks like a minute um and then like hundreds of clicks every couple minutes and people were subscribing to my newsletter and subscribing to my YouTube and podcast and it was it was a sight to behold and it was just this unlock where it's like wow it's almost like we've moved on from Facebook right like it's all about Instagram ads we're all on inag and Instagram crushes and it's great but Facebook's over here like hey uh we got 2.5 billion monthly active users like we're still here we're still doing fine and so that's the backdrop and I just think that a lot of creators if not the vast majority of creators are ignoring Facebook reals and they're not taking advantage of that valuable real estate uh the top comment the top pin comment and so I think there's a world where you could build a tool to automate that a simple you tool that maybe it's a Chrome extension or something five bucks a month where any Creator as soon as they cross post that automatically pins a top comment on their Instagram or you could build an agency like tool where you play middleman between creators that don't really care to pin anything in their top comment and creators that do like hey you're in the makeup Niche hey I sell a makeup product will give you you know a 20% affiliate income just automatically pin um these links in your talk comment what do you think so first of all I'm just going to put this out there I need to get this off my chest for a long time I still log into Facebook like probably once a week I'm just putting it out there you know yes I'm a 35-year-old male and yes I do log into Facebook from time to time and that's because sometimes their emails bring me back uh sometimes their memory emails bring me back I'm very like nostalgic person so uh I'm always like oh what was I doing on this day eight years you know 11 years ago um the birthdays sometimes I'll be like oh I think it's my friend Jeremy's birthday that I went to high school with but I'm it could be tomorrow so let me go check Facebook I think there's a lot of Millennials who are actually on quote unquote Facebook account as weekly active users or monthly active users um that if you ask him hey are you on Facebook they'd probably say no it's kind of like how how when you ask you know when you look at the polls people just say they don't vote for Trump but secretly they vote for Trump yeah that's that's where we're at with Facebook Jim Gaffin had a standup bit about McDonald's he's like everyone's like H McDonald's I don't eat McDonald's like look at their sales like you guys just don't admit it everyone's eating McDonald it's delicious it's like who who Who's eating it right like there's someone eating it yeah so that's that's where we're at with with Facebook um so I think the the thesis that Facebook is only for people over 65 which is basically an hour World we're kind of like that's that's what Facebook is isn't necessarily true shh don't tell anyone but I've got 30 plus startup ideas that could make you millions and I'm giv giving them away for free these aren't just random guesses they're validated Concepts from entrepreneurs who built hundred million plus businesses I've compiled them into one simple database compiled from hundreds of conversations I've had on my podcast but the main thing is most of these ideas don't need a single investor some cost nothing to start I'm pretty much handing you a cheat sheet the idea bank is your startup shortcut just click below to get access your next cash flowing business is waiting for you yes it is for older people it does skew older but it's it's not necessarily just for old old people there are some random waus like me weekly active users this is a gift that you're giving people that this exists that there's this is like an Arbitrage opportunity I do think that there's obviously this is a growth idea so anyone who's building anything could go and now start posting uh cross promoting so thank you for sharing that there's also an agency idea here um where I think the tagline could be something like we go where you don't have time to go and it's basically there's a bunch of social networks there's a bunch of places where um you know you should be there but you don't have the time because you you really you know if you're building an audience you want to focus on one platform or two at most so for example Kora like everyone knows that you know answering questions on Kora is really great for SEO and drives traffic but no one had who does that do you know anyone who does that I did that in 2014 and it it went great I got millions of views but uh it's you know it's been 10 years so no I don't yeah neither do I you know neither do I but like I I go on to Google sometimes and cor comes up and I'm like that was a great answer and just just like Facebook cor's over here like Hey we're still here we're actually doing fine in fact people are forgetting about us and you shouldn't totally so I think there's an agency like that you can build here small to mediumsized business businesses you you approach and and you say like we'll do it for you there's also focusing it just on creators so you're like hey for $500 a month I'll go do this for you you don't have time to do it you're not thinking about it I'll do it for you yeah or or threads I mean if someone were to cold email me right now and say hey few hundred bucks a month I'm just going to copy and paste all of your long form tweets starting with the ones that did the best the threads because there's from what I've researched there's no API that allows for that right now um and shoot you roll in Cora while you're at it just repurpose all the the best performing long form tweets as Kora questions and not answers totally we can call that thread heads.com I love it it's it is interesting because like with all the opportunities that API and zapier creates type and uh like air table and all that for the platforms that don't allow for those things there's still an opportunity to just have someone overseas do it affordably you still make a really good margin with it because it's you're literally copying pasting yep cool anything else before we hop on to the next one um no no I think that's it all right what's numero dose all right number two programmatic SEO been around for a little while I feel like it's making a comeback there's a a startup that just got funded have you heard of them I can't remember their name but they're basically you know oneclick programmatic implementation using AI um very very expensive by the way like I want to say it's like $5,000 a month maybe upfront in a $ thousand dollar a month I'm over here thinking like man you're using AI why are you charging so much this is what I would pay a human to do it um anyway we started a programmatic SEO agency or not agency um a project and we just did it all ourselves and I won't tell you the niche because I don't want people to copy me but we didn't do anything special in that we we just went to Google uh keyword tool and said what's a home service that everyone's searching for that no one's bidding on and there's hundreds and we could talk about that all day so we picked one that we were familiar with we went to webflow uh we used this tool called tag parrot whale sync uh and then um Believe air table tied it all together it auto indexes wait I got to explain what those tools do for people who don't know what that is so whale sync I believe it auto indexes all of your pages um and tag parot um will I could be getting this wrong but it will it will give you keywords in your niches um and so basically zapier enables us to connect all these things and start pushing out content to thousands of websites so we went to the five most Search keywords in our Niche that have low competition and we built 1100 landing pages for each one of them 100 for the top 100 Canadian cities by population and a thousand the top American cities by population because Canada is about 10% as big as American that left us with 5,500 landing pages and we started getting clicks lots of clicks and leads like actual leads worth hundreds of dollars and this just kind of unlocks something for me so we didn't invent program SEO it's been around for a while but the idea of a programmatic SEO agency that acts more of an alternative to a franchise so if I'm you know 30 to 50 something working in 95 wanting to break out into entrepreneurship I'm looking at pressure washing franchises and poop scooping franchises and what have you framing this as an alternative to a franchise of like hey um we found this home service maybe it's gutter cleaning that very few people are bidding on and a lot of people are searching for we will charge you $10,000 um and deliver this business to you quote business um like with a bow on it you still have to manage it you still have to respond to leads it's yours after that and then we'll charge like a nominal fee uh per month to maintain things for you and fix them as they break versus just starting a programmatic SEO agency and it's like H five grand to make a programmatic website like it's just the framing of it is a little different that's interesting so so basically what you're saying is let's just say uh painting like um house painting so I'll use programmatic SEO to generate you know a ton of demand in house painting in Miami Beach and I built the landing pages and Suite of landing pages it's generate you know I built the SEO juice it's working um I just need someone to fulfill the service at a high quality and I'm willing to basically partner with someone to and then basically split the revenue with them so basically focusing on cash flowing businesses I would imagine um local businesses um because SEO is especially good for local um and is that what you're saying so yeah I I didn't even give enough detail that's one thing you could do you could use this as a platform to launch a brand new painting business like an actual business where you're doing the painting in Miami and you you hit all the neighborhoods you get all the ZIP codes in the areas and you start generating leads that way or you could sell this as a a franchise that's like a lead gen franchise where it's like we're going to put you know house painting in city name in 10,000 different American cities you're going to get leads and then you're going to sell those leads to house painters in those local areas um so basically it's like a lead generation franchise do you know much about lead gen businesses I feel like they're not really talked too much about in in like Tech Twitter Silicon Valley yeah I love it I love lead generation businesses who who's doing like who can we study that does lead generation really well and like what's the scale of a of a big Le genen business who can we study I'm not sure on that but they can easily get to be eight figure multiple eight figures in Revenue especially if they're in a profitable Niche for instance there is a um there's a nationwide dumpster rental company and unless you know what you're looking for you would never know that they don't actually have a presence in all these cities because they have uh Google my business profiles they have reviews on all these profiles they have all the city names but there is no physical location um they're just selling these leads to local dumpster renal companies but the hard part of the lead generation business is finding um a centralized buyer for all the leads otherwise you're having to Wrangle up 500 different house painters and begging them to say hey my leads are better than Thumbtack or Angie list and so I think the key here is to pick an industry that's fairly Consolidated that has big players maybe their franchises maybe it's just a big national chain where you can talk to one person who has locations in hundreds of cities and say hey I'm going to give you the first 100 leads for free you're going to love them after that I'm I'm going to charge you 40 bucks every time we send a lead your way it's just one point of contact I was driving with a buddy of mine he's a he's a a big real estate agent and we get to a red light and we see these signs that say We Buy Houses for cash and then a phone number so it was like a bit of a lull in the conversation so I just like brought it up you know making small talk I'm like I wonder who actually sells their house by calling these phone numbers it's also like a really nice area like I just didn't really make that much sense to me if you're going to sell your house your house is you know the average house in Miami Beach is at least a million dollars let's say um are you really going to call this random phone number and then he goes oh you don't understand this is actually a lead gen business so they have these signs all over North America and then they call these people they get insight to people who are kind of on the fence if they want to sell their house they're just basically fishing to see like what is their house worth so and there's so many people that are just curious that you know oh if it's if you can sell your house for $1.2 million today yeah maybe you would um but if it's only worth $ 800,000 maybe not and then they sell those leads I don't know who they sell it to um like are they selling it to re other real estate brokers are they selling it to um private Equity who want to buy you know Blackstone who want to buy them I don't know but it was just interesting to see how you know this one funnel that isn't digital at all was was is probably crushing it yeah so I love those signs they're all over Texas and they work they're mostly selling them to wholesalers or they're using them themselves as a wholesaler are you familiar with real estate wholesaling no so basically you you put up a a bandit sign you get a phone call and say hey I just got divorced I really need to sell my house and you go look at it in person and you say okay well you know I can only pay 300,000 like well Zillow says it's worth four yeah but I can pay cash and close in 30 days okay I'll sell it for 300,000 you get it under contract maybe you put in $500 earnest money and then you take the contract and you go sell it to the end flipper or investor uh for 20 to $30,000 and so this is a whole sub genre that's taught in you know Hotel seminars all over the country where you know how to how to make millions in real estate without putting any money in it's wholesaling and it's really kind of scuzzy there's a lot of shady stuff that happens but a lot of it originates with those bandit signs intersections idea number three what do you got for us all right so AI tool to automatically repurpose viral content in your Niche across platforms so one thing that's surprising to me is that something that's going viral over here let's say Tik Tok uh people on Twitter or Instagram have no clue about for instance I I post about entrepreneurship and so back in October I saw an article and it was on like some random CBS affiliate side cbs13 Dallas for worth.com or something and it was about a high school um here in in Dallas Fort Worth that is opening only for entrepreneurs and the whole downstairs was dedicated to entrepreneurship the upstairs was dedicated as a high school and I put it in like my content Bank like things to tweet about one day back in October and then a couple months ago I was like oh oh yeah let's get around to this and I just tweeted about it offand and it went massively viral and then I posted about it on Instagram and it went massively viral but it was nothing new and I don't even think it was viral on this CBS website um it just resonated with people and there have been other times where I've just I've seen something that went viral and then I repurposed it and just kind of talked about it and it it goes viral over there and so uh you know six months ago this is all a very manual process but today I feel like there's a prompt you could do that says hey here's all my keywords put it into Claud or or or open AI or something here's all my keywords is is what I'm looking for um these are the metrics that I would like to see maybe number of comments number of shares um I want you to fill my inbox every morning uh and tell me like how viral is it or how much engagement is it getting and what platform is it on today and then I want you to go ahead and repurpose it for me on my platform of choice and it's just a numbers game there's only one thing that's missing from this idea that I would love which is give me a prediction of how many Impressions likes follows I'm going to get from posting this and I know that's not going to be perfect and sometimes it's going to be wrong but I think that one killer feature around tell me how many Impressions start with one platform how many Impressions will I get on Twitter that itself is so so so valuable and I think you're absolutely right there's there isn't really um a lot of data on on the life cycle of content and news stories and I know I would be willing to pay for a service that served that up to me on on a silver platter I care less about scheduling it and automating it to be to be honest because there's there's tons of platforms that do that but I think that there's a huge opportunity around uh definitely an eight figure opportunity around uh exactly the this the trending nature of stories and content have you found any good AI tools that will like an llm that will enable you to upload all your tweets and say like write 10 more Tweets in my voice based on like here are my tweets here's all the engagements I got on these based on what you see goes viral for me write me five Tweets in my voice that is likely to go viral have you seen anything like that I created a Greg GPT like a custom GPT I uploaded all my newsletters that I've written for years all my tweets I exported all my tweets I trained it on that and it's not there like I don't get I I I'll I'll say I'll give it hey I want to write a tweet here's my outline you know write it in a listicle format like I normally write it and it's just maybe it's just I I just hate anything that isn't my me personally um because it's my voice um but so maybe it's me um but I actually think that I don't know man these the it's just not there yet it's not there yet yeah have you tried dely have you heard of that that's basically d l p hii it's like create a clone of yourself oh dely yeah I tried that with the same thing and uploaded YouTube videos and and I just I wasn't happy with it like I'm I sure you are too I'm very picky about what I I don't have any ghost writers or anything so I would love for it to say like hey you wrote about these eight really interesting business ideas here's 80 more that are just as interesting right about these and I'm not get that um friend of the Pod I won't I won't say who he started a billion dollar uh business sent me a text yesterday Hey brother do you do your own writing or do you work with a writer and I wrote 100% myself and he's like you have no idea how much I was hoping you say working with a writer or working with AI you know we're we're GNA say this and people listening are gonna be like oh I wish they were just going to say the one here's one tool I used um there isn't one tool you can use you can definitely use AI like uh you can definitely use chat gbt or Cloe um as I say um Cloe uh to to to to to train a little bit and be like right in this style um it's not going to get you ready to post material but it might get you it's not going to get you from point A to Z but it might get you from point A to B that's the St where we are with AI writing and AI content it gets you could get you from a point A to B which is great it moves you forward and and and that's awesome one thing I'll give a tip for for Content creation and using some of these AI tools what you can do is you can give it an outline of here's the tweet I want to I want to write and this is the style I wanted to be in ask me questions if you don't know how to do this or you don't and you're missing any information then you and then it becomes your writing assistant so you've now turned uh you've now turned chat chat gbt into a writing assistant and you're going back and forth and then the chances that it gets from point A to B is instead of 30% it's like 70% yeah it's like tell me what to ask you yeah what's my problem you just you be hon you'd be vulnerable with it and you're like listen I know you don't might not know me I know we're just getting to know each other like make it fun have fun with Chad jbt a little bit yeah I like it quick ad break let me tell you about a business I invested in it's called boring marketing.com so a few years ago I met this group of people that were some of the best SEO experts in the world they were behind getting some of the biggest companies found on Google the Secret Sauce is they've got a set of technology and AI that could help you outrank your competition so for my own businesses I wanted that I didn't want to have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I didn't want to depend on ads to drive customers to my businesses I wanted to rank high in Google that's why I like SEO and that's why I use boring marketing.com and that's why I invested in it they're so confident in their approach that they offer a 30-day Sprint with 100% money back guarantee who does that nowadays so check it out highly recommend boring marketing.com all right next idea uh number four let's let's I like this idea tell me more about it okay so shady Rays is a $130 million um sunglasses brand and their entire business was built on their lifetime warranty and so forget like patagon and what all the other brands do because that's a different expensive product Shady Ray said know that you're going to break or lose your sunglasses don't worry about it you know we will replace them no questions asked so it's not like you know you have to return them if they're broken it's if you lose them we will replace them and then they work like a a restocking fee into it to where they they break even on All The Replacements they work the numbers into it where they're like all right you know most people replace their glasses seven times over their lifetime so and then they the the lifetime warranty allows them to charge a lot more than a competitor and they crush it so I just love the idea of copy pasting this exact value proposition in any other Industries such as sandals like flipflops lifetime sandals um same thing right you can go to AliExpress and buy nice looking flipflops for three to four dollar shipping is 50 cents to a dollar um sell them for $50 to $70 you have amazing growth margins you charge $5 um every time someone needs to replace them the $5 covers the $3 in shipping and the $2 sandles and you're great so it's just all it's a whole business built around a lifetime warranty value prop in an industry where it doesn't exist today okay so this is the first time I've heard of shady Rays did you know that they have this VIP program I don't think so so the way the stocking fee works is the restocking fee is if you lose your glasses if you're a part of the VIP program it's like $15 to restock um but if you're not a part of the VIP program it's like $20 let's say um and to brilliant and to join the vi and and you get you know what do you get by being a VIP is you get like 5% extra discount priority order Early Access to sales dedicated customer support um now it would be really smart if they charge for this VIP program I don't know if they charge for it um yeah I was going to say what does it cost like they should they should I don't know it doesn't say um it just says it just says are you in um so I'm not in I'm just gonna go ahead and so I guess you you just have to have made two purchases within 12 months wow okay so that could be optimized that could be optimized I think of I'm them I'm creating A5 to $10 a month uh call it even yeah $4 a month something no-brainer and it the whole goal is to get you to buy more things um so I I love it I love your idea I think there's probably a hundred other niches you can go and apply this to yeah this is this is brilliant Shady raay was like all right you we've got 60% net margins like well I I'd really like to have my cake and eat it too like how do I get more loyalty out of this maybe a little more recurring revenue and they just launched this it's bold but I love it love it want hear next one yeah this this is your last one this is your last idea so oh geez should I go for the Shopify or the Etsy one go with the Shopify one okay you you passed the test because that's the one I wanted to go for um so this this business is proven like people aren't doing it but it's proven I know it's proven because I've done it I launched it when I owned a 3pl a third party Logistics business as a side project it worked it was great but we abandoned it because opportunity cost we found something better so the long and short of it is if you have a Shopify store there's a zillion Shopify apps third party tools that will help you increase your abandoned cart and abandoned checkout rate automated SMS emails you know Shopify has their own uh Native solution to this but the best converting um fix for abandoned checkout or abandoned cart they're two different things is to get a person on the phone right to get them on the phone um we could talk about using AI for this there's tools that have you know AI voice cloning we won't talk about all that we're talking about a a literal call center of preferably like stay-at-home moms like a demographic that matches the customer um that just says hey you know you had this makeup in your cart but you didn't check out can I give you a 30% off discount like what what did you have any questions and a lot of times they're like yeah I just didn't understand like is shipping three days or 10 it wasn't clear so a you get this amazing feedback that's hard to quantify B you get you know your conversion rate if it goes from two to two and a half% your sales increase by 25% it's amazing um and so we tested this with our own brand and it worked but what wasn't great about it was that our aov our average order value was like 60 buck and it was kind of a tight profit business and so it it financially didn't make sense but there's a lot of products out there that have an aov of 100 plus or that have 80% gross margins where your your cost your labor cost to to make these calls um it's like you know single digit dollars call it three to six dollar um and it can really really make a big difference on your conversion rate and on getting feedback so the business here is to just be an agency use builtwith e extract all the Shopify Plus stores and say hey I know you're not doing this because no one's doing this but I know this works here's a no-brainer offer um we won't charge you anything we're just going to take 20% of everything that we convert if we don't convert it we won't charge anything and we'll give you all the feedback we get about your store for free okay and say someone wants to start this business how do they get to the Shopify Merchant someone might be listening to this and be like yeah cool I like that there's a no-brainer offer I love the ICP I love that it's you know going to bring in monthly cash flow but I I just don't know how I would get to hundreds if not thousands of merchants so you go to builtwith decom and it's $450 which I'm too cheap so I go to upwork and I post a job that just says hey I need someone with a built with account I'll give you 20 bucks just run a quick export for me I've done this before there are people that have up accounts that have built with accounts and 20 bucks and you can have all three million Shopify stores contact info in your inbox and then from there just use your imagination you can cold call them cold email cold text them um and I I would start like I would I would name it something broad but my branding on my website would be in a very specific Niche like apparel or makeup something high margin and or high ticket and in my pitch it's like we only do do this for makeup shop 5 plus Brands that's it then you you know you build some good Mr with that you make a name for yourself and then as you start to exhaust that Niche you broaden out and offer it to anyone else my man drop them gold appreciate you coming on uh where could people get to know you a little bit better on the internet yeah um the cner office podcast YouTube channel um spelled like my last name beautiful you got any qu you got you got a last question for me what's on your mind um I want to know what what platform are you most excited about growing your personal brand on today like where what are you most bullish on and why uh I mean it's really just this podcast YouTube thing you know the startup ideas podcast Spotify Apple YouTube and why just cuz the it's the it really does build Affinity with people and if they listen to you every week um that Affinity compounds and it's cool it's really cool like especially the audience that I'm attracting right now which is a lot of people building Indie hackers people who you know are at their desk job but at Google or something but daydreaming about building a startup zero to one um like we talked about in the beginning these are these are these are your people these are my people and uh I feel lucky I get to this is my job like I don't do this fulltime right I just get to come on here a couple hours a week and and and and jam ideas and someone told me this morning yeah I love the startup ideas podcast it's like junk food for my entrepreneurial brain um I don't know how I feel about that junk food but I get it I get it right there there's ideas people and there's non ideas people and there's this uh people people say like who oh uh ideas are nothing execution is everything but that's not how we talk about ideas like when we talk about ideas we're talking about okay here's this Shopify abandoned card idea but here's actually how you go and start it and here's the idea of like the the sub ideas on how to do it and so I don't know where this this podcast goes and I don't know where this YouTube goes but I'm I'm getting energy from it that's for sure yeah okay last question it's along the same vein if you take a YouTube subscri a loyal YouTube subscriber a loyal podcast listener and then a lawyer a loyal newsletter subscriber three things in my opinion like the three best type of followers or subscribers and someone comes to you and says hey wave a magic w and you can buy as many as you want of all three uh what what do you offer to pay them for each one right so three bucks for newsletter two bucks for YouTube $1 for podcast you know what I'm saying where do you rank because I could say like which is the most valuable but that doesn't tell me what the waiting is for each it's a trick question because I know a lot of I'm not going to name them but I know a lot of other podcast like B2B Creator type people who have tons of sub subscribers but it's low quality views and lowquality comments and just low quality um let's say we know we know they're high quality and they're not just a subscriber but they're watching or listening or reading every week I think that YouTube is the most valuable because they're listening to you they're watching you and they see you so I don't know a YouTube subscriber if it's high quality um $7 um I would say close second is probably Spotify and and apple like audio listeners maybe $6 and then newsletter subscribers like quite low like a dollar or less interesting I wonder if you're G to get a bunch of spam emails after this saying hey I'll buy you all the YouTube followers you want oh no $7 here here's a 100,000 no and and that's like I'm not trying to grow my YouTube to 5 million subscribers I'm not trying to goow my podcast of you know 20 million you know followers stuff like that I'm I'm I want to grow slow and steady and I want people every week there's more and more people and it just feels like this ground swell and and just and I don't need to be Lex Friedman I don't want to be that big I just want this group of people who are interested in building stuff and do think that audio and video is the best I will say this weekend this past weekend something cool happened to me I uh I'm drinking my coffee and actually I drank a few coffees and that got me to tweet a lot usually you can tell that I have a lot of coffee is when I'm tweeting a lot that's how I I get it out and I tweet something and then all of a sudden I see my notifications blowing up who replies to me Elon Musk oh that's my bucket list dang it could you believe that oh what did he say what what was the context so okay I'll pull it up oh I've been dreaming I tweeted about Tesla yesterday went massively viral nothing for Elon it's like he doesn't even know who I am I'm sorry about that that must suck you know that must suck so here's here's what went down so I go the current state of the X algorithm is your Tweet will literally never be seen by a soul or you go ballistic with one to 100 million impressions and nothing in between so then he goes I agree we need to fix this so then I go I want to help I first of all context it's 114 it was like 1113 or something or whenever I I got that you know was like 11 something when I got that when I saw it and and I was on my way to go work out with a friend and I didn't want to be late so I was like oh my God Elon mus just tweeted at me and I don't have Twitter on my phone because it's smart yeah right because I'm a yeah I'm a I'm not gonna put a Twitter on my phone of course not you know why so I down I'm like oh I'll download Twitter I download Twitter I responded and I just responded quickly um and yeah I was like I want to help I advis some of the biggest social apps before like Tik Tok and Reddit DMS open so then I'm I'm like doing dumbbells just like checking Twitter my DMs I'm like is Elon is Elon writing is Elon writing because I don't have notifications again because I'm a sane person yeah um okay and then one more quick thing happened that Elon said so then he said uh because Robert scobble this other guy was like oh no here's what he said hold on Elon mus writes I saw his post because a friend sent it to me forwarding links is taken as a signal but should be a far stronger signal so first of all the fact that someone forwarded my tweet to him is insane yeah and then then the fact that he later tweeted out that he's changing the Twitter algorithm to focus more on small accounts and he acknowledged it so like did I just change social media I hope not I'm not a smaller I I was like I've got almost 400,000 followers did I just R it for myself that's amazing you're totally true like things are go doing nothing or going crazy viral but I think it's a net positive yeah and that's the story of how I met Elon Musk and he never dm'd me there's still time I'm jealous all right Chris this has been fun I'll catch you later all right thanks

The Comfy UI Marketplace it needs to exist and I think someone's going to print absolute money with this so before when I started like two years ago if you want to do anything with AI That's deeper than just calling chat GPT you had to write python I think a few months ago and I found about this two weeks ago it's called com UI and it's basically just a really nice interface you can just drag in notes that you can connect to other notes and you can basically just build a visual pipeline where you have inputs you do something with the data and you have out out puts with it like I'm now rebuilding all my python stuff to com fui because it's so much easier to work with it's so much better to work with you can just also run it in the cloud now replicate I think this is going to be the next kind of wave in AI that we're going to migrate there so what if there will be a comy UI marketplace where people can just basically sell these templates that they build because you can export it you can save it you can export it you can rent them out you can let people use it and basically charge like a fee for it

Title: How I use Pinterest and Google to find $1M+ startup ideas
Published: 2024-08-23 13:00:48 UTC
Description:
In this episode, we dive deep into uncovering validated startup ideas by leveraging anti-trends on Pinterest and Google Trends. I'll walk you through my workflow, showing you exactly how to use these tools to spot emerging trends, identify key problems and solutions, and find creators and websites thriving in these niches. If you're looking for a fresh approach to finding your next big startup idea, this episode is packed with actionable insights you won't want to miss!

1) What are anti-trends and how to spot them
•  Anti-trends = opposite of what's hot right now
• Example: "AI-free" products when EVERYONE is jumping on the AI bandwagon
•  Why it works: Creates a unique moat + appeals to overlooked market segments
•  How to spot anti-trends: Real-world observations, Social media chatter, Consumer studies (e.g. recent study shows AI mentions LOWER purchase intent)
•  Pro tip: Always be on the lookout for what's NOT being talked about

2) Tool: Pinterest deep dive:
• Shows monthly/weekly changes
• Reveals related trends
• Displays popular pins
•  Example: "Slow living" trend analysis gives insights into minimalism, cozy bedrooms, etc.

3) Tool: Google Trends + Glimpse hack:
• 5-year view of trend growth
• Related trends
• Social platform activity
• Topic maps
•  Pro tip: Look for steady, sustainable growth rather than spikes

4) Competitive research workflow:
1. Use Claude AI to list top creators/websites in your niche
2. Analyze their traffic/backlinks with Ahrefs
3. Check creator growth on ViewStats

5) Key questions to ask:
• What products/services can I create for this anti-trend?
• Where's the audience hanging out?
• Any low-hanging fruit in terms of SEO?
• Which geographic markets are underserved?

6) Remember: Anti-trends are about serving overlooked markets
• There's often less competition and more passionate audiences in these niches
• Don't be afraid to go against the grain!

what's up everyone good to have you back today I really want to talk about something that's been on my brain for a long long time this idea of anti-trends you know we talk a lot about Trends and building startups for those Trends U but I don't think enough is talked about about anti-trends and today I'm going to talk about how you can come up with startup ideas based on those anti-trends how to identify anti trends some of the tools I use and just kind of bring you in inside my workflow because why [Music] not so let's talk about why I care about anti-trends in in the beginning so in software in startups it's a very competitive place and everyone goes for those Trends and what I've noticed it's actually quite easier to go to those anti-trends now what am I talking about what is an anti-trend if everyone is talking about ai ai free might be a great way to position your startup there might be so much demand for AI free that yes there's billions of dollars going into building startups for you know that are AI um and you see like every agency website saying Ai and every SAS website saying AI what if you uh what if you didn't what if you said AI free and these are the little things when you identify an anti-trend like that and you're first um it's a really good Mo so you know the question is like how do you come up with anti-trends well number one you go out there in the real world and it comes to you you just see it um now now in the example of the AI free thing I actually saw I'm going to share my screen so sorry folks who are Audio Only I actually saw and I tweeted this I saw that there was this study that said AI is a turnoff for consumers so a new study suggests artificial intelligence and product descriptions lowers purchase intent with implications not only for Brands integrating AI but of The Wider category challenges of the technology faces it it has become widespread point is if you don't use AI on your website especially in I think B Toc I think good things might happen for you so how do we identify let's talk about some of the tools that I use uh when I when I want to identify a trend or an anti-trend so uh and some of these by the way are so underrated so listen or watch to the end so you you understand all of them one is uh Pinterest here I'm on Pinterest this is actually Pinterest Canada one of the things I definitely uh just because I signed up when I was in Canada uh one of the things that you see here is a bunch of Trends so these are some Trends in Canada fall outfits weekly change of 30% monthly change of 400% back to school obviously dress to impress home gardening color book Nails okay interesting main character mode has a 10,000 plus monthly change Sun Soo spaces 10,000 plus when you start seeing these 10,000 plus like these are things that are are getting real big so one way to come up with ideas for anti-trends is just to look at what is trending on platforms like Pinterest and do the opposite of it and yeah I see that brat is is trending a little bit here but even brat you they talk about brat summer and now it's demure fall like that's the anti-trend to brat right um there's always an anti-trend so let's just say you know I've been thinking about this trend around slow living now what is slow living slow living I just noticed that there's a lot of talk around like hustle culture working all the time deadlifting cold plunge wake up at 5:00 in the morning don't don't you know don't stop work until 10 p.m. um that sort of thing it's kind of the opposite of my My Vibe actually so I think that slow living is going to be a more more important Trend um so I'll use a tool like Pinterest Trends to go and see like okay where am I going is it going down is it going up the one bad thing about Pinterest Trends is that it does only go to one year but what I like about it is it tells me related Trends so minimalist living rooms so now it gives me ideas right so I I start with my anti-trend and now it gives me ideas around what are the products that I could actually be building here so maybe there's an opportunity to create like the slow living interior design agency um cozy and you see you know cozy bedroom you see these are these are terms that are coming up and then it allows me to go check through popular pins um so I can open up a p a pin here that's popular um so let's just say this one living slow learn to do nothing put down your phone accept rest drink water go on a walk social media cleanse learn to say no smile be still connect with your community you know all this stuff and what allows me to do then is like now I'm learning about what is resonating with this audience I'm learning about what are the philosophies and principles of this particular uh community and in this particular anti-trend and it gives me ideas and then I just take out my notebook and I start writing down what am I observing you create a little page take out a pen you take a little page and you say observations and what am I observing about this anti Trend I'm observing that uh you know putting down your phone is like a big part of it or resting is a big part of it and then I ask myself what are products and services that I can go and create so that I you know I can monetize and you know build a community in that space sh don't tell anyone but I've got 30 plus startup ideas that could make you millions and I'm giving them away for free these aren't just random guesses they're validated Concepts from entrepreneurs who built hundred million plus businesses I've compiled them into one simple database compiled from hundreds of conversations I've had on my podcast but the main thing is most of these ideas don't need a single investor some cost nothing to start I'm pretty much handing you a cheat sheet the idea bank is your startup shortcut just click below to get access your next cash flowing business is waiting for you so that's Pinterest um there's also of course Google Trends that you can use which is similar so let's go put slow living and you can see over the last five years this is worldwide it's progressively going up um this is beautiful to see you know I look at this and I'm like there is certainly some opportunity to be building in this space this is a trend I like to see it's not like up into the it's not like crazy growth and I actually almost like that better because uh to me this is a sustainable uh sustainable growth then you can see uh what people also search which I find really interesting but I always check the questions to me the questions is is the most important uh place to start what is slow living how to practice slow living what is the art of slow living this basically puts you in the mind of uh people in this anti-trend so Google Trends you know it's completely free to use I don't know why more people don't use it I forgot to I forgot to say so I actually added this Chrome extension I have no affiliation with them at all but it's this Chrome extension called Glimpse discover Trends before they're trending and it just maps on it basically just supercharges Google Trends so so it also adds things like related Trends which is super good to know um so I can go and see all the related Trends and Glimpse gives me that I think it's free to use and uh you know I haven't paid for it or anything like that um and and that's really really you know helpful obviously to to know related Trends because then you go back to your go back to your um your notebook and you start writing what are the related Trends and and why you start asking yourself like why are these related Trends why is um why do we think food sustainability is in there sustainable business Euphoria party like what do these things mean and it puts you down that rabbit hole the other interesting thing about Glimpse Plus Google Trends is it gives you you know where are people uh like where the where's the most activity on social is it on Twitter is it on Instagram you can see here it's a it's very much on in stagram so when I'm in when I when I decide I want to create a a Social account to build an audience here because you know me I always like to start with the audience uh you know yes it's nice to be on Instagram because that's where the people are but maybe I go on Twitter maybe I go on Twitter because uh the competition isn't there and there's an opportunity to do that you know I have a friend who um is a coach um and health coach and she was on Instagram and she's like where else should I be and I was like you know go to LinkedIn go to LinkedIn cuz you know health coach for busy entrepreneurs her Niche no one's you know no one's talking about health stuff on or not a lot of people are talking about health stuff on on LinkedIn and she's built like a huge a huge audience on there so it's and and you know when there's not a lot of competition there's uh it's worth peeking in and then you can see the topic map so you can see like self-care Green living journaling I just find this to be a helpful way to um to just see what is going on in a bird's eye view and then these are the uh Google Trends related topics and related queries so you can see like just what are you know what are some breakout topics um slow living with a princess um these these you know you can just start scrolling through them having fun spend spend 30 minutes here spend 30 minutes and start um observing and uh and and and writing down um another way to obviously discover trending topics so you'll find things that are trending and look for anti-trends is um if you do download Glimpse you can go to the Discover Trends tab you can go to discover Trends tab you can you know click into things Home Improvement let's say and it takes a few seconds but it'll pull up like what are the different graphs and what's starting to um go up what's the search volume um so you can see like AC cleaning High income business and then from that again you have to come up with ideas uh around around what what can I be building here and uh I've talked about uh how I use Gummy Search in a previous video a fous YouTube video how to do that um and I think I might create a video and pod around how to validate some of these ideas if if if enough people are into that uh comment on the YouTube if you want if you want me to create a video around that or pot about it but um coming up with ideas are on places like on Gummy Search or just asking yourself okay what do these people need so Glimpse SLG gooogle Trends is something that um is very very helpful um another thing that I do is is I'll go to a platform like Cloe and by the way in a previous video everyone calls it made fun of me of call that that I call Cloe instead of cloud um but I speak French and you know think about Jean clode vanam you you know I wouldn't call it Jean Cloud vanam that's not how you say in French though I'm sorry I'm gonna keep calling it clo um I might be wrong in in English but that's how you say in French so um so then I then I go to Cloe and I'll say I want to build a business in slow living give me a list of the top creators in slow sustainable living and top websites I can go show I can go check out for some compet competitive research slow and you know now I I I generally like to like really Define what it is slow living is the antithesis of hustle culture and then give me uh 10 of each let's see what they come up with so then I've got the list of the top creators in slow sustainable living and then I'll just go and check them out and then the top websites so this like add this to your document add this to you know and some people don't like writing down that's fine put it into a notes file like literally a notes file you don't have to use anything fancy the reason I like writing or using just a notes file is not using something fan you just you know go with what you got and then you can take some of these websites like you know let's see what slow. Co is I haven't checked this out okay so it's a a newsletter for for for slow living and then you can go and you know so I'll generally like look okay what okay there's something called the minimalist.org [Music] and what sort of traffic like you know how are they doing um and then I'll just start literally playing around like what are the opportunities any low hanging fruits in terms of SEO um back links I'm always interested to see like how many backlinks do they have what are their top pages top pages are interesting because it it signifies like okay what do people actually care about on these websites that gives you Intel into into what to do the organic compet ition is really interesting um so just play around with um a atfs and just see how competitive uh these anti-trend ideas are um because that'll give you confidence um around what to do um where the opportunities lie um so I would I would definitely do that you can also go to the keyword Explorer and just see how difficult certain terms are and then I also love looking at the questions you know me I love the questions part like what is slow living um and this just is it's it's it's interesting to see interesting to see where are people clicking in from like randomly Indonesia for example is like the top search volume so it's like that's really interesting what about Indonesian culture lends itself well to slow and then how hard is it to rank in Indonesia and do I want to rank in Indonesia or do I just want to rank in the United States um so these are the type of questions that uh you get to ask yourself it's amazing um when you're playing with some of these tools um another tool that I use um so once you have the list of the creators you can use a tool like view stats which is uh Mr BEAST's tool they also have a Chrome extension and you can actually plug in so let's just say um be more with less let's see okay does this person are they trending up like are they trending down are people list you know let's let's go let's go see so pretty small 11,3 like a lot smaller than I thought like not doing much so I look at this and I'm kind of like there's there's not much competition here at all let's go check how about this guy Joshua Becker and by the way I'm doing this just so you can like jump in my brain how I think about things like feel like a lot of you have asked like how do I how do I live cook basically so I'm going to do more live cooking podcast and YouTube videos so this guy is crushing it he's you know definitely adding subscribers he's making thousands of dollars a month um um things I look for is like how many videos he's doing I also love to look at long views versus short views I like basically don't even acknowledge short views anymore it's all about long views in terms of affinity so if there's a lot of long views it means that there's a lot of trust here um I look at I have to look at you know what videos he's doing too right um this might not be all slow living so this might this you know look it's like some stuff about just tidying stuff and decluttering but there's also stuff of like 10 reasons to escape excessive consumerism so there's definitely uh a part of it that's L still living in a part of it that's just like minimalism so there you have it I gave you my secrets I told you exactly how I find anti-trends which are kind of like the trends you should really be really be paying attention to and I hope you liked it and if you did uh like comment and subscribe just so more of this stuff is in your feed it's the least you can do you want your feed to be dialed if you want more of me in your feed you got to go and do that and it also just lets me know that I should be creating more videos like this um I did a video on how I find startup ideas with AI and uh if you haven't checked that out already go and check that out and if you want me to do a video on and Pod episode on how I validate startup ideas let me know and and I'll do it for you I'm here for you this is what these are about uh lifting the veil giving new startup ideas and uh it's more fun when more people are building you know and uh let's uh let's go get him all right hope uh hope this got your Creative Juice is Flowing I know it did mine uh thanks for listening and uh I'll see you next time later [Music] baby

and uh you know why I like SAS businesses so much is the margins are incredible you can expect anywhere from 70 80 90% margins what other businesses could you do that in and uh today that's what we're going to talk about only SAS businesses and by the way each of these ideas I'll give you the Playbook so the first idea is [Music] called Baby I just had way too much coffee and I get the Jitters and when I get the Jitters I need a I have the best startup ideas I don't know why so I just was writing down a ton of SAS startup ideas and I needed to click record and share it with you now you might listen to one of these SAS ideas and steal it and build the MVP in a weekend and it starts growing and growing uh all of a sudden you're doing a million dollars a month you end up selling the business to Salesforce and then you send me a DM or comment on YouTube uh change your life and I wouldn't be surprised or you might just listen to one of these ideas and it gets your creative juices flowing and that is why I love doing this podcast because these ideas you don't necessarily need to steal if you don't want to but it might just spark something in your own life it might just you know you you might hear this one idea for this Niche and want to apply it to another Niche that you know well so we're just going to go through these ideas I'm going to give them all to you listen to the whole thing think about them and uh you know why like SAS businesses so much is the margins are incredible you can expect anywhere from 70 80 90% margins what other businesses could you do that in and now it's it's it's cheaper than ever to go and uh build these MVPs build these minimal viable products so uh over over the last few years I've gotten more and more interested in in in building SAS products and I have built a bunch of them and uh today that's what we're going to talk about only SAS businesses are you ready I'm ready can you tell can you tell what this with this the coffee J Jitters all right so the first idea is called what I'm calling the legal jargon simplifier and I had this idea because I was just signing some documents with a real estate agent that I'm working with I'm selling uh I'm selling my apartment and I honestly didn't understand a lot was of of what was going on and I know a lot of you are like me so what if there was a oneclick solution like a Chrome extension that could demystify complex legal documents and I think you start with just terms of service so how would it work okay I'll give you the Playbook and by the way each of these ideas I'll give you the Playbook so you install the Chrome extension it's it would be free to start and then you activate it on any any web page with legal text so that could be you know a Google doc it could be a website um and then you click the extension button to generate a quote unquote for dummies version of the legal document now I don't know if you can use uh the term for dummies because it might be for the books but you get the idea something like that that's super catchy then what happens is the AI analyzes the text in real time um so then you get these like plain language summaries of the key points if you have a 20page doc hopefully it just gives you two three four points it highlights and exposes the red flags of unusual Clauses in simple terms that's really what you're looking for um and then you you offer a risk assessment score based on industry standards and user rights so and I know there's probably a lawyer listening to this and being like Oh my God you know I don't know if that you can do that and and I I'm not a lawyer I don't know I just wish this thing would exist and I know that people would pay for it um and how would they pay for it I think they you can you can charge something like $5 a month um it can be very very cheap or you can do something like $50 a year $75 a year and you'd get things like Advanced explanations document comparison stuff um so you'd apply very a very similar model to like a docu sign um you know you you get a free uh few signatures and then they eventually um charge for it so how would I grow this business you know what would be my growth strategy so I think you can actually create accounts like Twitter accounts Instagram accounts where you show like the simplified versus original versions of famous terms of services no one knows what they're signing when they're signing terms of services I think everyone knows that so um I think if you compared them and just showed what PE they actually said I think those would go viral the other grow strategy is just it's free right you're you're doing a Chrome extension so you can do all the uh you know uh App Store optimization in in the Chrome Store um and then you can do a referral program so protect a I'm thinking like protect a friend get a month free um and then of course you can partner with all the legal education platforms to offer this tool as a part of their curriculum I think that you can also do something cool where you implement like a legal Clarity certification for businesses you try to ride this wave that everyone knows that these terms of services are they're really you know there's a lot of words and people don't understand it so I think that if you can do that that's a huge business and uh someone someone would buy it I think you can definitely sell that business to to a Salesforce to a box.com to someone like that uh once you get your Revenue up so that's idea number one legal we're just getting we're just getting uh warmed up here quick ad break let me tell you about a business I invested in it's called boring marketing.com so a few years ago I met this group of people that were some of the best SEO experts in the world they were behind getting some of the biggest companies found on Google and the secret sauce is they've got a set of technology and AI that could help you outrank your competition so for my own businesses I wanted that I didn't want to have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I didn't want to depend on ads to drive customers to my businesses I wanted to rank high in Google that's why I like SEO and that's why I use boring marketing.com and that's why I invested in it they're so confident in their approach that they offer a 30-day Sprint with 100% money back guarantee who does that nowadays so check it out highly recommend boring marketing.com idea number two the micro influencer campaign manager so this is about streamlining streamlining the process of running a micro influencer campaign for small to mediumsized brands in micro influencer I'm talking less than 8,000 followers okay so how does it work well you use AI to identify and vet these micro influencers based on brand alignment and engagement rates followers that sort of thing and then you create basically an agent that automates Outreach and negotiation processes with these these templates you can manage content approval workflows and posting schedules you can track campaign performance across all the different platforms like IG and Tik Tok and YouTube and then you provide you know return on investment analysis and suggestions for a campaign optimization you can charge something like $149 for 20 influencers there's this growing demand for micro influencers and small to mediumsized businesses just they're they're it's it's like a lot of work to do you know if you have a store or something and you have two employees it's just difficult to um manage this and yes you know there's marketplaces that you can go to but I think if you can do an automated AI type of Micro influencer campaign manager there's something here so yeah just making influencer marketing accessible and manager for Smalling brand smaller Brands because I think this is this is just a bigger and bigger uh marketing channel okay how would I grow this thing so you you know I'm really big into tools and Lead magnets first thing I would do is I'd probably create an influencer campaign Roi calculator make it completely for free um I'd partner with e-commerce platforms to offer it as a marketing tool for their Merchants probably hard to do with Shopify because they're too big but you know the smaller ones I think uh I'm really into these uh certification programs so I think you can do something and a certification program for micro influencer marketing Specialists I'd Implement a campaign of the month showcase to highlight success stories and then I'd love to host some sort of speed dating event between Brands and micro influencers online get people to sign up and then you can nurture those people that is idea number two all right for idea number three I'm calling it the AI writing coach for non-native English speakers and by the way there are billions of non-native English speakers this is a huge Market um and they want to learn English they want they want to work online um and a lot of them uh could speak English well but sometimes writing it you know it's not their first language I get it speak multiple languages uh it's not it's not easy so the idea is basically creating a tool uh for you know writing Improvement for this specific uh specific Niche so okay how does it work um you start by just analyzing the users writing style and their common errors you give realtime suggestions for grammar style and vocabulary improvements you offer content specific language usage tips based on the industry and document type you generate personal writing exercises to to address the weak areas track and adapt suggestions over time so this is basically like grammarly but really focus on the non-native uh uh group and I think that just like the positioning if you just focus on that that itself is a huge opportunity and then again focusing on professional uh professional talking and really focusing on business I think a lot of people would pay for it and they' probably pay you know five 105 $20 a month and uh that adds up uh you can also do it um if you want to do like a yearly you know couple hundred dollar or $100 or you can also think about doing lifetime deals but you got to be careful with that because uh you really do have to know what your costs are okay how would how would I grow this thing um so for a tool perspective I do like a free professional English proficiency assessment tool and uh I'd probably just do a ton of webinars for like you know I'd be like the effective business writing guy for non or gal for non-native speakers so I would bring people in online I would show them how how writing has you know increased their job prospects have helped them get promoted um and I just yeah I'd start by just hosting all these workshops bring them in get their emails um maybe nurture them through a community where they can meet other people um and I think this is a multi-million dollar business the next idea all right so uh micro Lo a micro localization platform so I've actually told this story on the Pod before but um you know I'm here in Quebec right now and Quebec has this weird thing where it's like one of the biggest markets in the world for Pepsi not Coke you know I went into a store the other day like can I have a Coke they're like will Pepsi do you hear that all the time here in Quebec and it has to do with coch didn't really understand the local nuances of Quebec when they first came here and this is many years ago I think in the' 60s they just bought the same ads for British Columbia that they did for Quebec and that didn't resonate where Pepsi understood the local cultural nuances um and created campaigns that spoke to them so how do we think about that in today's world like how can we productize that create a SAS product out of it uh basically you do AI powered analysis of local cultural nuances and Trends you basically adapt automatically content for the different localities you know people in Montreal might um might speak a little bit differently or or or you know like to do different things and people in Quebec City you can integrate with all like the major cms's like the WordPress and social media platforms you do real-time performance tracking of localized content you know the content production isn't necessarily just words like this could be uh videos uh gifs all types of autom automatic content and then there's a suggestion engine for local Partnerships and influencers like these these Global Brands want to know what are the like what's cool in this neighborhood in this city different neighborhoods even are different so um I think you can charge something like a couple hundred dollars per locality so if you want Montreal and Quebec City that might be $400 for some of the bigger Global Brands you might even say uh you know and in some of the bigger cities you might even say certain cities cost more if you think of a city like New York City you know they're so they're so different you know even Williamsburg to to Bushwick is very different or uh Tribeca to the Upper East Side is different so maybe you're charging $199 for each of them so I think this is just cool because it all allows the global Brands to feel way local helps them increase engagement conversion rates and that's going to be the big moat um going forward I think local I'm really really bullish on that so uh how would I grow this thing I would basically do every month or every couple months these free cultural sensitivity reports for top Global Brands I'd create like a local rank score for Brands local adaptation efforts um obviously I'd be partnering with the different marketing agencies I'd be hosting workshops on the impact of microl localization on sales and I feel like no one really owns that um on places like Twitter so who's talking about microl localization um and then you just you know Implement a loc just a local referral program for for local marketing uh consultants and that's what I got for you today I don't want to overload you I want to keep it short and sweet these are some ideas and how I'd grow them I hope it got you thinking uh shoot me over a comment on YouTube and and let me know what you're thinking and and if you liked it if you want more of these powwows if you want me want me more to overdose some coffee I'll do it and I'll do it for you so uh thank you for listen the startup ideas podcast and I will see you in the comment section see y [Music]

Title: How to write a book with AI [step-by-step guide]
Published: 2024-08-12 13:00:48 UTC
Description:
I’m joined by Justin Welsh, a 7-figure Solopreneur & Creator, where we dive deep into how we would build an AI-powered book empire and the opportunities and challenges that AI brings. 

1) AI-powered book empire 
Greg's step-by-step process:
• Use Claude/GPT-4 to brainstorm book concepts
• Analyze Amazon bestsellers with Jungle Scout
• Generate detailed outlines with AI
• Use Grammarly & Hemingway app for editing
• Leverage Bookstat for real-time sales data

2)  The rise of AI brings opportunities AND challenges 
• AI will devalue most content, making it harder to stand out
• Top 1% of creators may earn 100x more due to increased demand for quality
• Early adopters can capitalize on AI-powered content creation
• Long-term success still relies on unique perspectives and staying power

3) Creator-led businesses: The new frontier 
• Example: Midday Squares
• Buying products as a "tip" for valuable content
• Stand out in a world of commoditized products by becoming a person people want to support

in a world in a world of commoditized products how do you how do you stand out and become not a product people want to spend money on but a person that people want to spend money on yes exactly and you buy the product because this person has given me so much value in my day-to-day life therefore you're like tipping the Creator's Journey this is the beginning like this packaging where the people are in the packaging is the beginning of a bigger Trend which is they're going to take more and more real estate like the chocolate you see over here like is still 99% of the packaging and the people is only 2% in the future I'm sure it'll be like 50% the people 50% the chocolate yeah might even be the opposite of what it is now where it might be 90% the people and 10% of chocolate which could be [Music] interesting all right Justin Welsh Mr solo perur you don't do a lot of podcasts and somehow I convince you to take some time from your vacation to come on and jam startup ideas with me and startup ideas for soloer so thanks for coming on yeah of course man Greg it's really good to see you and uh you know I know you swung through my living area many months ago and we got a chance to bite tee together and so uh here I am ready to uh talk s Bas so you have a few list a few ideas on your list here maybe let's start with the first one because it's something I've been thinking about too you want to you want to hit it yeah so um I've been thinking about especially having grown my following and been approached by some publishing houses uh in the last year or so just like the approach to becoming a published author and I've talked to a bunch of my friends who are creators or entrepreneurs and have followings and and they have kind of some of them have started the book process others have finished it some are trying to decide whether or not to get into that that process and it feels like um it's really cumbersome and there's a lot of unanswered questions it feels like the negotiation um the advance picking the agent picking the editor and maybe it's because I'm removed from it and I have not been through the process um but it it feels conversome and it feels um a bit scary intimidating and like you might get into something without having all of your questions answered and so I'm thinking and I made a note here around AI but I'm thinking through that process in general and how do we make that process easier and since I kind of jotted down some of these ideas I actually think people are starting to approach that that problem already I saw the guys from base camp have come out with something called once.com I haven't done a deep dive onto it yet but it seems to be a way in which to get your book out pretty quickly I believe that James clear and Tim Ferris are working on something um as well that seems at least tangentially related to to to that so my big question around that is just like how do we streamline the process of becoming a published author for folks that don't want to go through the really difficult process of doing so so I think you're talking about write book which is the Jason freed product right yeah yeah yeah maybe it's right book that's right once.com was the product before that I'm confusing the to you're right yeah write book exactly yeah so write book I just pulled it up instantly publish your own books on the web for free no publisher required so this is basically it looks like it's how do you make book publishing as easy as blogging yeah exactly yeah it's under the once brand here yeah I I like I I use hey.com which is a product from the base camp guys and I love all the Simplicity that they built into their products and like if anyone is going to attack that that model this this doesn't seem to be tied into becoming a you know New York Times best-selling author or getting published under a Big Brand this seems to be a way to sort of instantly publish your own book but I actually think that is just as good an idea as disrupting the traditional you know publishing model like this seems to be faster better easier have less uh friction for those who want to get started and like do we see a major disruption do people in 10 years not publish with huge publishing houses anymore is everything done through something like a WR book and I don't know there's a part of me that says that that's possible or likely yeah so something I've been thinking a lot about is how do you how do you create an AI powerered book Empire and so it's less about Justin wellsh show Greg Eisenberg wants to create a book and like yeah maybe we work with penguin or we do a on.com but more about how do we how do we create a hundred books in in a year what would that look like and I've got actually a stepbystep framework for how I would go about and and do it you want to hear it I do yeah I'm very interested and then and then I'll argue whether I think it's a good idea or not but go totally I love it this is perfect and this is this is why I brought you on is because like we can chat ideas and you're you're you're a guy who call me on my stuff so um I appreciate that about you okay so if I wanted okay how to build an AI powered book Empire in 20124 so the first thing I would do is I'd use Cloe or gp4 I'm actually I'm using uh Cloe just like 99 times more than yeah it's just way better so let's just say use Cloe to brainstorm 100 plus book Concepts based on trending topics then what I'd do is I'd analyze Amazon's best sellers list with the jungle scout app um for Gap identification so are you familiar with jungle Scout I'm not no I'm looking up now yeah so uh a lot of people who are not in e-commerce have never heard of jungle scope but it's basically I think it started off as a I want to say a Chrome extension um and it allowed uh people to see competitor insights and keyword analysis on different products so you can go on to you know call it a um I don't know teapot and you could see that this teapot used to be priced at $40 and now it's on $30 and they've sold 4,000 of them today so I would use this with with books because I can basically just see like okay what's selling what's not selling what are the trends um and I don't think many people are doing that um then what I'd do is I'd use chat GPT uh or clo to generate detailed book outlines based on some of these trending uh areas are you with me I have like a million more steps yeah yeah I I am with you I'm just like quick ad break let me tell you about a business I invested in it's called boring marketing.com so a few years ago I met this group of people that were some of the best SEO experts in the world they were behind getting some of the biggest companies found on Google and the secret sauce is they've got a set of technology and AI that could help you outrank your competition so for my own businesses I wanted that I didn't want to have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I didn't want to depend on ads to drive customers to my businesses I wanted to rank high in Google that's why I like SEO and that's why I use boring marketing.com and that's why I invested in it they're so confident in their approach that they offer a 30-day Sprint with 100% money back guarantee who does that nowadays so check it out highly recommend boring marketing.com I I as soon as I hear you kind of going down this like step byep building a book with AI my mind pulls back to this quote and I forget who it's attributed to and it's it's popular so I'm sure someone will will know who said it but it's something to the effect of I think it was on Twitter like I want I don't want AI to write my books and do my art and like all that wanted to do the dishes and like pick up my room so that I can write books and do art and so like I just wonder from a long-term perspective if everyone's writing a hundred books and by the way I recognize that not everyone's going to do it people always ask me what if everyone was the solo preneur so I get that's it's a stupid question but like if a lot of people are doing that does the art of like writing a really strong and powerful book with compelling study and like user experience um does that die do do you think about that when you outline this stuff or does like does that just sort of you separate yourself from that as you're thinking through it I think the reality is AI is going to devalue the majority of content period so in a world where it makes it easier to create any sort of content book content video content podcast content tweets posts whatever it's going to be devalued and it's going to be harder for artists let's call them artist people come up with unique perspectives point of views to to stand above the noise that said once they once they do stand above the noise or they you know they are recognized as unique I think that there's massive amounts of staying power and I think that the top 1% of artists are going to make 100 times more in the next 10 years than they will in the previous because there's going to be such demand for curated experiences but that being said I think that there's a trem there is a gap and an opportunity right now to do some Arbitrage around creating content with AI and automation now that doesn't mean that just it needs to be a book by Justin Welsh it could be a book by Jane Wells you know and sure and as long as you read the book and you're like wow there's value here then I still think that there's a huge it's I personally am interested in exploring this space yeah it's an interesting like just just to be clear like I think AI is fascinating and I'm also like um not a person who's like oh because I like the creative side of things and because I like you know unique in personal art uh that I somehow don't believe that AI will will overtake those things I do my my big concern around it and not to like cut you off on your on your book idea but like my big concern around it is you say people are going to become experts or have a very unique point of view and there's going to be staying power around that I think a huge concern that I have is like how right so someone gets a someone gets one one inch into a into a journey that they're really excited about where they have a really unique and meaningful perspective and like you're talking about using jungle Scout to see trends like there's going to be much more complicated software at that point in time someone's going to see that right away and say this person is getting some form of traction and like before they can get traction and get a leg up and get staying power let's just steal that let's just take that and so I just wonder like how does some go really deep get a ton of traction in an area of expertise and like stand out in a sea of people creating hundreds and hundreds of things based on what that person has already just started I feel I I feel worried about that I I think like I struggle I struggle to Envision a world like that does that make sense yeah it totally makes sense and I'm happy you bring it up because 70% of the people listening to this are gonna are having the same voice in their head so it's good that you're bringing it up okay let's let's think about the world before the internet or at least early internet like people were probably having a similar conversation around sure that you know okay I'm a print designer and now anyone could create art on Photoshop or Ms paint and it's so much simpler and faster now doesn't that like destroy art um doesn't it make it okay now now there's going to be a thousand times more artists because is you know you don't have to go to the Parson School of Design and you don't have to like buy canvases you can just like fire up your you know Microsoft 3.1 or whatever it's called it was called and and or Ms Doss or whatever and just like start playing around yeah I think like being a Creator being an artist is going to evolve and there are going to be tools that are going to make it ridiculously easy I.E jungle Scout in 20 in the year 2030 but I still think that if I'm trying to like learn let's just say I want to be I'm really into coffee and you know I was a barista for five years and I wanted to um create content and create a business around coffee that's not a coffee shop I could still use jungle Scout and learn like what's selling what's not selling and then come up with my own point of views and create a business around it and hopefully yeah you know it is it is a a way more competitive space today you know in in this time than it would be in in the previous but I my point is I think not using the tools is a risk a very big risk huge risk I I I totally agree um I am not anti- AI I don't find it to be a particular particularly fabulous writer at this point in time it's certainly getting better clo is the best I've seen right like I think chat gbt writes pretty ter I've tested it out on a bunch of different things but like again we're only a few years into this thing like Fast Forward 10 years I think it's going to be tremendously different I think about someone like Jack butcher right who's like like as Internet art and by the way that's only because this is my ecosystem so I might be blind to those who came before him and we creating something similar so I'm I'm speaking within the realm of my my what I know on the internet like when he came out and started creating art like he got some traction it became oh I can look at that and know that it's something by Jack like I can see his style I know that's a visualized value piece and as we've kind of gone over time like you know you've had maybe five or 10 or 15 or 20 or 25 sort of knockoffs of that you know and it's kind of getting faster and faster and faster and I'm I fear for a world and not to kind of again take this back full circle to like what I worry about but I do feel for for a world or fear for one where a jack butcher gets traction on one piece and the next day there are 10,000 pieces just like that and it's like how do you stand out in that noise and it's a question worth answering like the the answer is you have to and I just I just wonder what a world full of noise looks like the way you stand out is you are Jack butcher you will always be one step ahead of the competition and no one could compete against Jack butcher in that in that sense only Jack butcher is Jack butcher so today today to today but you know okay if I want to compete with Jack butcher in an AI world what do I do I study all his previous work MH and I I basically I become Jack butcher's brain but Jack butcher's brain is essentially Jack butcher up into today and previously now Jack butcher could decide to go from black and white to red and yellow um tomorrow and that and then they it does it does become a game content then becomes a game of right cat and M I think that's what that's the trend that is is is beginning yeah I fear for that Trend like I by the way it doesn't mean it's not happening like cares what I who cares what I think emotionally um but I do like wonder what a world like that feels like I mean it sucks it's I hate that world too by the way just to be clear like I hate it and it's not fun because people like me and you who like put stuff out there and we spend so much time like crafting things and then the next day it gets copied or duplicated it it totally it feels it feels wrong um but the point I you know that's the that's the negative side of this the positive side of this is there there is a ton of opportunity to to be building things in a in totally totally what what's the point of an original thought if the next day it's duplicated to an infinite degree exactly so like like but I do I do agree there's tons of uh I was just watching a video on someone using perplexity and clo to do like SEO optimized articles and like he was prompting perplexity and Cloe and like couldn't spell and I was like this is what happens like people can't spell like they don't even know how to like do common reading and writing and I'm just like is that a world like do we need to know that anymore I guess not but maybe I'm just like a classical person but like I was just I was very flabbergasted by that so I'm G to get back to the book steps in a second sorry sorry sorry but before I get back I have to say this little story clo was down yesterday and I noticed clo was down I'll be honest I was trying to like use it for a software project and I wanted some help on it and uh I went on to Twitter and I was like is CLO down and a bunch of people were saying it's down and I saw a Tweet someone said a very well-known entrepreneur I won't tell you who it is but a very well-known entrepreneur says I literally thought I was going to have a productive morning today and I can't go to work because I don't have Claude that's kind of kind of scary yeah that's what we're moving towards but um it's it's a muscle it's like riding a bicycle like once you stop riding on your own or thinking on your own and you let something else do it for you it atrophies totally now that being said let me tell you how you can use clothes to make1 sorry for uh sorry for getting you off your your your book idea continue so so then you got your outlines so you've used chat gbt or clo to make the outlines used use the uh the outl you know clo to make the chapter drafts one of the things I would do is I would I would write um you know you know prompt something like pretend I'm the editor and here's the 10 ways in which I write and just give them detailed instructions of how you write and you can train that I could train that based on Justin Welsh I could say like here's a 100 posts that Justin Welsh has done write like Justin Welsh and then bring out um you know Justin generally is a very clear thinker and he Ally never buries the lead uh these are things that you can pull out and that you can uh put in into Cloe yeah their projects their projects functionality is pretty amazing that is yeah exactly yeah yeah I I I find that the the projects functionality is light years ahead of like chat gpts memory and things like that yeah totally the project functionality in itself is worth the $20 a month oh 100% totally yeah uh then you you can use uh not many people know this but grammarly uh they've got like an AI for well a lot of people know it but I I've been using it a lot recently for just real-time editing and proof reading um you can also use uh Jasper AI for Content generation and and like if you because you're going to be reading a bunch of these a bunch of these articles that Clo's going to be outputting and you might be like wow this is actually not that good so if you need new ideas you can use something like jasper. a the Hemingway app have you ever used that yeah yeah I use it to make sure that my writing is at a certain grade level for my newsletter or my social content um I know about what my audience likes to consume at so I use it almost almost daily can you talk can you talk about uh how it works and and how you use it yeah so so basically the one functionality I use inside it is grade level and I want to keep my grade level writing between seventh and eth grade like I've run multiple like a battery of tests against both my newsletter and my LinkedIn content not so much my my like X content because I don't think it matters it's much shorter the brevity is what matters um but I will push that through uh uh Hemingway and I will basically not just the grade level I also look for like sentences that could be more clear clear Clarity and conciseness because that's something that I think I've become known for if I had to like guess uh on social media is like taking complex ideas and making them very simple and while I think I'm generally pretty good at that there are definitely times when I overwrite when I make when I choose too many words when I make things too complex and so I love Heming way for that and I often realize that when I write I use words that to me seem simple because they've become part of my lexicon from working in startups for 20 years from being around people who are certainly more academic than I am um and so Hemingway helps me kind of bring that down seventh to eighth grade reading level I've written in third fourth fifth sixth seventh 9th all the way up to 12th and I will look at Impressions I will look at reply rate on my newsletter I'll look at engagement and that 7 to eight for me is just like where where it hits there you go that's that's really helpful to know I actually I should do that I'm and uh but yeah with a book it's also equally uh important so you want to put that content into Hemingway and check uh check the readability and and areas that you can improve there's a tool called then the next thing I do there's a tool called book stat I had never heard of it uh but heard about it just and you know through the research of this um and the coolest thing it does is like our our buddy sahill Bloom is um launching a book and wouldn't it be cool to see if you know if I was competing against Sahel bloom in terms of his book how many pre-orders a day is he getting um and the trend around that so um it's basically subscription data service and I think you're going to see a lot of these pop up just a lot of these subscription data services in a bunch of different Industries um but it just gives you real-time stats um that'll help you uh change the positioning of your book title chapters um and and help you around the marketing of it that's really interesting I often wondered if there was a tool like this like um you know just very candidly as I've watched like sahill and Ali abdall launch their books um I mean the consumer or or even their friends um have very little visibility into you know there's there's rah rah around it and like you might assume that it's selling a thousand copies or 5,000 copies a day but um the reality could be very very different um and when someone's not like a New York Times bestseller my question is always like how close were they or like what was the gap between them you know making and missing the mark and this is a service that it looks like I could kind of figure that out which is really interesting really totally and it's you you actually go on their website and it looks like it's a website from $1 1999 totally I'm like what is this this is crazy um the next thing I would do is uh you have to templatized [Music] you you can use uh I think it's lulu.com they have a AI powered formatting tool so it's it's ready for print print um but you'll also need a cover design so you know could you use AI uh to create the cover design design yeah you can use Dy 3 or mid Journey I'm starting to feel that a lot of those tools are just like you can tell it's AI generated I don't know totally yeah oh totally yeah it's it's just like I don't know it's it feels like commoditized to me at this point um it's supposed to be new and unique and interesting but like every visual that I see and by the way I'm not an AI artist and most people who use it are not AI artists with the prompts so they're just getting generic output and so everyone's generic output looks exactly the same um yes you know I'm sure I'm sure if you're a professional you know digital artist who understands AI prompting you can probably make something wonderful but for 99.9% of us that's that's not us exactly so you can use um you can use an agency we have an agency that we built design scientist.com little little plug there um and uh you know or just find someone go to like upwork or or or Fiverr or or whatever whatever your budget fits and and uh get a human to design it nothing wrong with that the the book cover matters like the book cover really really matters it's like one of those things where in YouTube land they say doesn't even matter what your content is all that matters is your title and thumbnail uh it's very similar in books where the title matters a ton and the and the cover matters a ton yeah a friend of mine is a 12 time New York Times bestselling fiction author writing crime and he's he's in his 80s and he will tell me all the time like he'll have a really creative idea for a book title and he'll run it by me and my wife we're like we like that and then he'll bring it back and be like the publisher is actually going with something much more simple I'm like oh I don't like that at all he's like yeah but it describes what's inside of the book and I was like right right that makes sense that makes sense it's the same with YouTube right it's like yeah totally it's the same so then I would uh there's also another uh company I I found they're called blurb.com um they also allow you to do layouts so the layout of your book which's cool about blurb.com is they have these templates so you can like go and make a children's book and then they have these like children book templates or photography like let's say you want to create a cooking book you can you can do like a photography one um so I think that's really cool um and again in our world no one talks about this stuff yeah you've strung together like the most AI Tools in history to do a really cool process like I'm I'm actually um really impressed you know I go about as far as perplexity chat GPT and Cloud um these are all really interesting I feel like my this audience loves like tools so yeah and I feel like you appreciate the stuff too it's just like we're all looking for unfair advantages yeah in some way or another so another thing thing that is really useful I think is Spotify I think they might have bought this company but they' they they I don't know if they bought it or they incubated it's called find findaway voices.com and uh I'm pretty sure they actually allow you to do an AI n narrator selection for audiobook production wow that's really cool so you don't a huge process that's a huge process yeah it's a huge process and especially if you're if you're Jane Wells and you sound like Justin Welsh you don't want you know you don't want to be going into record you know renting recording studio and and recording for for three days straight sounding sound like you sound yeah it's it's really interesting as you're as you're going through this like um I mentioned something during the book design part where I said you know 99.9% of us aren't AI artists nor do we understand how to prompt AI to create beautiful art and I may have just answered my previous concern or question where it's like how do you become the next Jack butcher well it's no longer about the stroke of the brush or the the how you move the mouse it's more about prompting like how do you become a world-class prompter which in which in turn the outcome is world class art so I guess I have to like Focus my brain on thinking about how how the world changes that way and what being great at something looks like and I think it's going to be a lot around prompting it is and you know just this morning I was talking to uh a finance someone on my finance team and and she was like what is this charge here this charge here this charge here and I'm like oh man have I gotten carried away with AI tools and just like premium tools like are we going to spend on one hand I was like scared but then but on the other hand I'm like listen Maybe I'm spending $5,000 a month on these tools but uh you know you you wouldn't bad an eyelash have paying someone five you know a salary $5,000 a person $5,000 a month right like $60,000 a year so I think that's what's going to happen is these software tools from a percent of your costs are just going to increase versus human beings yeah I was talking to an entrepreneur the other day who were main named was seven figure entrepreneur in the like digital sort of knowledge space and like um has a team who basically takes his uh content and chops it up and creates it you know for for different social platforms and he's like I'm kind of frustrated because their prices are going up and I was like how are their prices going up like explain that to me like with all the AI tools available right now like the service they provide their prices should be going down or you should be like you should be spending one day next week like designing all of your prompts and if you really want somebody else to write your content for you like the following week you should be able to press a button and do it yourself like uh I can't imagine like service companies for copyrighting right now like having the gall to raise their prices Maybe I'm Wrong on that but like I don't know I see that going away fast yeah yeah I I I agree I got a couple more tools for you and then and then our book will be launched our Empire will be launched nice um draft to digital number two draft to digital so their tagline we are self-publishing with support self-publishing on your own is kind of daunting I've actually explored this it's daunting even think about how many steps we just we just went through um so draft to digital um is services and tools to help you with the publishing the distribution the layout and the print on demand paperback so they just give you a little bit support very cool yeah I think this is going to be a huge industry just like getting helping people produce longer form content whether it's AI created or not irrelevant like and getting it to the masses in forms that they're used to I think is going to be just right for like tons of players as you're already showing me right here right I've got tabs open right yeah and and and you can you know what I love about some of these business models like draft to digital is they don't they don't charge you they just charge 10% of the retail price so they they can tack on a little fee so you would have charged $20 for a book now you charge $22 $2 goes to them um so anywhere anywhere where you can do a pay per performance or paper usage or paper task model I think is is going to be interesting to people like here's a question I have that maybe you haven't thought about or maybe you have and you you'll answer it here in a moment but I've got one two three four five six seven eight nine different tabs open at the moment as you kind of go through this creation like who becomes the who takes all these Point Solutions and becomes the allinone for this yeah I think that's that's like an interesting question is why do I have to use nine services for for producing one outcome like why can't I use one service for that let me just pull hold on one sec I want to pull up a name of this new app okay so I I first of all I completely agree that it it's overwhelming and what's going to happen is each vertical is going to consolidate and you're actually starting to see this in Mobile too did you see this app that just came out the other day called hero assistant it's pretty interesting um if you think about our mobile like our our our iPhones let's say we have to open up our calendar we have to open up our weather we have to open up our mail we have to open up instacart reminders they're all separate apps and it's getting overwhelming it's the same issue that it's one of the same issues that you're describing in AI it's like there's too many different Services I mean AI has two problems one is how do you find out about these Services besides listening to the startup ideas podcast and then two and two is uh H how do you how do you make it a cohesive simple experience and in in Mobile you just have the issue of like you have the App Store so it's easier to find the apps but um what hero is and is really interesting and is getting a lot of people talking is it just brings all those apps calendar weather perplexity instacart reminders into one interface really cool I'm like I'm looking at right now yeah I think that's what's going to happen in AI but not yet because we're still in the soul searching trying to figure out use cases phase yeah this is I think this is this happens in every single every single problem that I have today in my business is solved by several different point solutions that don't communicate with one another this like the last startup that I helped build was a medical startup that essentially did exactly that took every Point solution a physician used and put it together in one allinone solution sold it at a better price right that's why 200 million in Revenue today um I see that exact same thing coming to everything that a Creator does everything that a writer does everything an entrepreneur does will be like at first first spread out amongst nine to 10 different apps and then put into one and I think that's like how do you become either one of those 10 or the one yeah that is like a really big idea that you're sharing which is how do you be the node in all these different Industries and someone listening you know it doesn't need you don't need to pick a a node in like publishing which might be overwhelming but you can pick a node that's like in a sub niche um and still be that and it's and and those businesses have huge sticking power and are are great to create can I give you an example of something that I've been thinking about recently um so as a Creator across multiple platforms like let's think about my workflow on a regular basis so everything that I do starts with a tweet right like I might try and think of something interesting or useful to say on on X right um I throw those out there because a short feedback window so you know you you get feedback in 10 minutes you know whether this thing's going to go well or go poorly once you once you push it out there um since I'm pushing stuff out there on a consistent basis I have a lot of pieces of content that I can choose to use in different ways oftentimes what I'll do is screenshot that add some context it's a LinkedIn post right do that a couple times a day figure out which one works the best I can take that same screenshot same context move it over to Instagram copy the Tweet bring it over to threads like there's just a million ways to sort of organize this stuff that in and of itself is one problem that needs to be solved because like going back and forth between different notion tabs different publishing tools becomes very conversant and confusing then add to the fact that inside of every Discovery platform I want to bring my audience to my website have them do a deeper dive on learning about me and what it is what problem it is that I solve um so every piece of content has to have a relevant piece of deeper long form content that is related to it so I can drive someone naturally in the next call to my website so hey you want to learn more about this or want to go deeper on this go check out this article go go check out this newsletter I have a repository of newsletters and articles it's not easy for me to find which one is most relevant and therefore make it the call to action so like that's another problem that should be solved with one click of a button I use cloud projects for that but today Cloud projects doesn't talk to tweet hunter or tap Leo or any of the publishing tools that I use then I want to meet smart interesting people who I can start to network with on social media I do that on platform I do that on LinkedIn I do that on X I do that on Instagram that doesn't exist in the publishing tools it doesn't exist in CLA so like there are these disparate problems um that I have to solve through all these different tools and I'm thinking to myself like why not one tool why can't I do this inside of one app and why don't I build that why wouldn't you build it I would yeah I mean it's it's something that I'm very interested in building um I figure you know if I solve my own problems I'll probably solve a thousand other people's problems totally but you're you're not actively building it today right it's just an idea potentially I love it I love it say less my friend this is a big idea I I you know I also have the same issue which is um even though I use less tools than that um in content I still feel like I'm going from place to place and I'm getting basically like content wh Whiplash that's how I feel same why can't I focus on writing one good idea like even if I don't want to use AI for that and I just want to write myself like because I like to write but once I write one good idea why can't I hit one button and just be like go all the places you're supposed to go and do all the things you're supposed to do that's I I just want to be the creative like I don't want to figure out how to stitch together all this different stuff just like let's build that that automation now right for fun and hit the button and everything works that's that's the world that I Envision AI being fun in in less uh taking over creativity I guess yeah and there's there's you know this could be really big like we often forget but who's a billion doll company even on the Indie hacker side like I just had TBO from tweet Hunter on he sold it for $10 million so um there's a lot of demand for Creator tools and um if if you can build this efficiently uh I yeah I think people would pay for it and and very candidly this is my opinion by the way like I can't I don't have data to back this up but I think I can in a in a weird way which is like I use Tapo and tweet Hunter and I like TBO and I think his team builds really good products um but in a way in a way many of the products that are on the market today and it's not just in the Creator space or publishing space um are not too dissimilar from one another uh they are becoming more and more commoditized and I think what is most important is if somebody uses it and so what I'm seeing is like the companies that are standing out in the publishing space like a tweet hunter or a Tapo have the big creators behind it the big creators use it the big creators talk about it they sponsor the big creators newsletters they're in front of the big creators audiences and like you might look at that in another tool and they might at first glance look relatively similar but if you know that I use it or sahill uses it or you use it you're just more inclined to use it as well and so I think for someone like myself how do I leverage how do I use that Advantage uh you know as I'm thinking about both solving my own problem and building something that isn't commoditized and then combining it with um you know a brand and and a person who who's known for creating content those are things that are kind of circulating in my mind at the moment so what you're kind of saying is it's similar to like the Mr Beast chocolate Feasta BS it's like why are you buying a Feasta BS over hery joab bar it's like oh no I Mr Beast is my guy I love him I want I want to show you something real quick I just off camera right before I came on I had this thing called a midday Square have you seen this product I've not so it's it's cool packaging functional yeah so if you're not watching on this YouTube um YouTube by the way if you're not watching on YouTube just go to YouTube and subscribe and comment and like do those things but here it is the midday Square cookie dough flavor and you when you when you pull it into the other side what do you see oh three faces who are these three people they've been actually building this company this is Jake uh this is Jake Nick and Leslie they're the three co-founders they've got like plus thousand followers and they've been building this business in public the highs the lows uh Creator Le company and you buy the product because I mean the product's great but it it's also because you want to it's almost like a tip you're like tipping the Creator's Journey you're like this person has given me so much value in my day-to-day life therefore three bucks for the choco bar dude totally I I actually think like I buy from a lot of creators just as a tip yes like there there are Creator friends of mine who creat something that I absolutely have zero interest in I'm consuming and like when it comes out I'll buy it because like you know if I read a hundred of your tweets and a thousand of your posts and I read your newsletter every week like the least that I can do it's for small businesses least I can do is give you a tip so when your product comes out I will buy it 100% And I think a lot of people operate that way some people don't but a lot of people do I think most people operate that way that's fair even subconsciously subconsciously some people opposite yeah some people are completely the opposite yeah yeah but I I I appreciate you sharing that because I think that's I think that's big in the future is like in a world in a world of commoditized products how do you how do you stand out and become not a product people want to spend money on but a person that people want to spend money on yes exactly and I think you're this is the beginning like this packaging where the people are in the packaging is the beginning of a bigger trend which is they're going to take more and more real estate like the chocolate you see over here like is still 99% of the packaging and the people is only 2% in the future I'm sure it'll be like 50% the people 50% the chocolate yeah might even be the opposite of what it is now where it might be 90% of people and 10% of chocolate which could be yeah you'll be like why am I eating oops I hope I'm not eating like a leg right now cool I like that that's cool I'm have to look for that product or at least follow their story I not familiar with that cool um Justin this has been great uh didn't think we'd go here but we this has been fun and got my my creative juices are flowing how you feeling feeling good man I didn't expect to go there either um uh you had way more um tactical information on on the book stuff so I I think your audience can someone will run with that um I think what I hope that people take away from this is like a lot of the stuff that we talked about in just solving your own problems I think a big part of startup ideas at least in the future is going to be being cognizant enough to pause when you actually have a problem like I I go through problems all the time day after day after day the same problem and it actually takes me like weeks and sometimes months to pause and be like why haven't I solved this like what's a much because we're so busy and we're so heads down that that becomes a problem and I think um a lot of folks if they can make themselves stop and think through those things we we'll start to see ideas flowing in much faster than they normally do amen if people uh people want to support Justin Welsh and find you on the internet where where could they go they can go to Justin welch. me that's Justin wl. me uh they can follow me on X or LinkedIn and uh that's about it they can subscribe to my newsletter this Saturday solo preneur send out one newsletter every Saturday morning 4 minutes or less 220,000 solo preneur subscribe they can and will cool great great chatting with you man good seeing you my man later see you [Music]

Title: Creator tools you can build that will print money
Published: 2024-08-07 12:45:04 UTC
Description:
I’m joined by Tibo Louis-Lucas , Founder of [Revid.AI](http://Revid.AI), as we explore a wide range of Creator tool ideas and business opportunities

1) Brand & Influencer Matching 2.0
• Passionfruit's success shows there's still room for innovation.
• Idea: Flip the model. Create a "link tree" for brands, not creators.
• Use AI to curate & rank inbound creator applications.
• Brands save time, creators find opps. Win-win. 

2) Framework: Mini-Tools Strategy for Growth
•  Build  small, useful tools related to your core product.
• Example: Taplio's LinkedIn video downloader drove 1M+ monthly visitors.
• Key insight: The simplest ideas often outperform complex ones.
• Let users try core features without signing up. Genius! 

3) SEO Isn't Dead (Despite ChatGPT)
• Action-based queries (e.g., "compress video") will still drive Google traffic.
• Double down on building useful web tools.
• They'll likely remain relevant even as AI search evolves.

4)  Content strategy: Humans + AI is the future
• Don't rely 100% on AI for content creation
• Combine AI assistance with genuine human experiences.
• Story-driven content will always stand out. 
• Bonus Insight: Anti-positioning is underrated.

5)  "Certified No AI" Product Suite
• As AI-generated content floods the market, there's opportunity in the opposite direction.
• Idea: Build a suite of "certified no AI" tools for content creation.
• Position as the authentic, human-centric alternative.
• Tap into growing AI fatigue.

and so all the free Su optimized tool that you would build you can rank for many many long T keywords and then uh sell your main product all the mini tools that we buil like I think I think we buil more than one per month so at the end we had like 40 SE optimized mini tools and all all them together was bringing like U were bringing like uh 70% of the of the traffic you just gave away a gem someone someone's going to listen to that and it's gonna it's going to spend the next 12 months of their lives just building mini [Music] tools you know yeah I I'm excited to have this conversation um I've been following you for a long time and when you sold uh when you sold tweet Hunter and and and you sold Tapo for $10 million I was like okay this guy is this guy is legit um and just seeing your process of how you come up with an idea uh how you name it uh how you come up with unconventional ways to grow it um how you care about design and copy I was like I need to get this guy on the podcast so thank you for uh thank you for coming on that's pretty cool thank you so what is on your mind these days um so yeah when you invited me I think I so I spent hours thinking about IDs and the thing is it always it always goes the same way like uh first of all you have this like blank page where you can just you have no ID at all and you just you just get one you you try to like go a little bit deeper on this ID and then it's like NeverEnding flow of IDs and I have I have one thing that I I find it very interesting it it may be something a bit boring but I I just stop I just can't stop thinking about um brand and influencers matching yep it's it's something that we we have seen over and over um and and I really thought that the space was dead because like you have hundred of startups doing that until I I noticed this new thing like passion fruits do do you know about passion fruits I do but tell tell people what passion fruit is it's it's an it's a startup that basically makes you able as a Creator to breed like packages of um ready to go sponsorships like you want you want you want to offer sponsorship for a tweet for a YouTube video or or anything else you can just build these sponsorships and brand can very easily book them like with payment calendar and what's what's very awesome about that is as brand when I start booking um like a sponsored tweets they open this channel of communication through like no signup uh email flow which is super super convenient for brand and creators to use and so I I noticed that I noticed them as a client first and I just just I couldn't stop thinking about that because to be 100% honest before I started doing any any startups I thought about this like I thought about brand and influencers and for me the space was 100% saturated like we couldn't innovate in in that like there's just nothing to do and you know you know what just when it was it was in 2015 and just so many things was like were created in this in this space since that time and so my my point here is that there's just so much things to do to to do to do here like when you think that space is saturated you can just do 100 more things yeah I mean I'll be yeah I'll be real with you too so I thought that the spage was saturated too there's there's there there is like a hundred of these Marketplace startups I think what was interesting about passion fruit is they focused on creators like me and you so like the B2B type creators and the other thing that they did was they allowed creators who had newsletters to create almost like a um link tree but for sponsorships so it it was like a really easy way to create a profile where it's like okay Greg Eisenberg decom is an you know is a newsletter there's 75,000 people a sponsorship cost x amount of um and it was just like a beautiful web page so I think the question I have here is okay I buy the point I I I I I agree that sometimes you can look at a space and it's overloading with startups um and that's the Creator space right now but what what would you build if you can build anything in the space so I I think you've nailed what they what they've nailed like they they just they just build the super simple to use portfolio that will just make creators money and I think that you can just you can totally reverse reverse the this page like do it not for creators but for brand like find find a way to create this link tree like page for Brands where uh as a Creator I can just go and I can just see what kind of SP sorship a brand would like quick ad break let me tell you about a business I invested in it's called boring marketing.com so a few years ago I met this group of people that were some of the best SEO experts in the world they were behind getting some of the biggest companies found on Google and the secret sauce is they've got a set of technology and AI that could help you outrank your competition so for my own businesses I wanted that I didn't want to have to rely on markk Zuckerberg I didn't want to depend on ads to drive customers to my businesses I wanted to rank high in Google that's why I like SEO and that's why I use boring marketing.com and that's why I invested in it they're so confident in their approach that they offer a 30-day Sprint with 100% money back guarantee who does that nowadays so check it out highly recommend boring marketing.com and find a way I think I think the hardest like the the hardest to do here is cation and moderation because obviously you would have like a chunk creators like shitty creators uh applying but if you find a way to use AI in a good way to rank uh sort and grades the creators coming in you can just make the life of of Brands and agencies super easy by just by just creating this INB flow of creators so that's really interesting so something happened to me for the first time ever recently where I had a brand reach out to me I'm just going to pull up the email so Logitech reached out to me and they're launching this new Pro product and they want to like send it to me and then they're like we want like a text based post and a YouTube video obviously I didn't do it cuz like I don't use any Logitech products and it's not really in my like my model like my model is to give a lot of value away for free and in the future hopefully that pays back to me somehow but I think it's really interesting that you have Brands what are Brands doing they're either going to marketplaces or they're going to agencies to find to to find these creators and Deals or they're just cold dming people like they're just saying like hey you're an interesting YouTube channel so I think what's what you're suggesting is to flip the bottle on its head what you're saying is Logitech should actually create a page and say like we're really interested to do this right is that what you're saying it's it's it's exactly this and I'm I'm suggesting this because I we we kind of did it with um tweet Hunter like uh I think I think it was like at the peak of our growth uh we we realized that it made a lot of sense for us to sponsor a lot of people because because we are Twitter product obviously it's super relevant to sponsor uh Twitter creators but we were like missing out on we're missing uh good creators to sponsor and so we open this page saying hey we want to we want to sponsor creators this is a rough just plug plug your Twitter and this is a rough calculation of how much we would pay you if if this is uh good enough for you just apply we would get an email and we'll start the conversation there it was super simple product just one one page uh the calculation was super dump I think you can do something very good because it it just worked like when we just tweeted about that uh we got hundreds of application that it became a nightmare to sort them and to to spot the good ones so that's that's the real issue to solve so what what would the business model there be so if you if you want to align interest uh you can maybe um take a cut on the sponsorship that you make the brand able to sign but obviously I would not do that at the very beginning because it would it would just make everything more complicated uh if you want to just sell the sell the shovel just a regular subscription based on maybe the brand size would be maybe the the easiest to begin with what do you think yeah I think uh obviously what a lot of marketplaces do is they charge for access but you can't charge if you're just beginning you can't you can't go to L'Oreal and say or Logitech and be like hey it's going to be $500 a month for access to this and we're going to take a cut of whatever the transaction is going to be because when you're starting out starting out you are no one like that's the reality and that's the thing that a lot of people don't say is you're you're starting off with like no credibility or very little credibility your goal right now is to prove that you can create value so I think what you do is initially You just prove out that you can actually do this thing so get the brands on board don't charge anything once you get the brands on board you're going to get the creators on board which is beautiful right and then eventually you can take a cut eventually you can take a 10 to 20% cut and some of these brand deals like I think Logitech wanted to pay me like 10 grand for like a text post you know it's like and but yeah just let let me suggest slightly different way like you as you said like you you make it very easy for both people to just jump in you make it easy for Brands to just create the space uh they have this onepage beautiful page where uh creators can just book a sponsorship but then what what they realize is that it's super messy they get hundreds of applications and the service that you offer is moderation sorting and like AI creation of all the inbounds um offers that they get and and you charge for that like you you you charge for the handling of the of the moderation and and booking of the sponsorships which is the hardest part of any sponsorship like you the the back and forth of how of like the brand wanting to uh the Creator to respect their guidelines to validate the that's that's the hardest part if you can just provide value on these steps that would be awesome and how would you how would you go about getting the brands like how do you go from having no Brands to 25 Brands um what's interesting is you you can probably scrap I don't know like uh Facebook Twitter uh Instagram and and try to find um many many many contents which H sponsorships the the the way I would do it I'm I'm pretty sure that on Twitter you have keywords that are like in in 90% of sponsorships like something like sponsored by or together with things you you have you have these stuffs on newsletters so it's I I guess you can build a list of uh Brands who sponsor stuff right now and just reach out to them with coating yeah I I think you I mean use a couple of those tools I think that that's great I think one of the things I was thinking about is you do you do really need to Niche down a little bit like you can't be like the Creator you know Network for everyone so I think I'd probably start if I was building this in the B2B space so I'd probably look at passion fruit you know I'd probably go on passion fruit and say like who's you know who who are the top creators and on passion fruit they like list the top creators um they list like you know you've got Ali abdal you've got islo the notion guy you've got you know Dan go who's a high performance coach um all these people so I'd reach out to them and then I would see I'd make a air table or or Google sheet of who are the over the last 12 months who has sponsored an Ali abdal newsletter or YouTube video and you create this list and they create this database which by the way you later use as a lead magnet right super cool yeah so once you scrape all of passion fruit and sorry passion fruit if you're listening to this and you're like that's a good terms of service so you know this is you know I don't I don't know if it's against the terms of service but let's just say you can go and do that um then you create this uh this database and then you say to people like hey do you want to see who's who's sponsoring the world's largest newsletters you know you you put some Twitter ads behind that all of a sudden you're you're getting leads at 50 cents to $150 a lead I I would do I would do something something yes like Bas based on just what you've just said I would try to do a a tool because like as a as a brand if I want to sponsor a Twitter Creator to promote my AI products I want to know I want to like not mess up the tweets and so I want to have like a a library of past sponsorships uh which could be like tweets YouTube videos stuff that worked very well and because I want I want to get inspired and So based on what You' just said I would try to build this library and to make it a tool because if you if you make a tool and you you build like a tool which would rank for best sponsorship in marketing or best sponsorship in AI or best sponsorship in like e-commerce you can rank for many many longed keywords and then uh sell your main products and would you charge for that tool no definitely not like I would I would try to make a SEO optimized Tool uh with many many um super um super specialized page Pages like one page for e-commerce one page for coordinating Etc like list just libraries just libraries of uh the best sponsorships that you can find on uh on any Niche yeah dude this is actually a good idea you want to build that yeah I mean kind of I I I do think um I like it cuz it's one of those ideas that you can see how you'd connect the dots like you you start with the Twitter account that is just showcasing who's sponsoring who and what sort of click rates you're probably getting and how much money they're making and and you you tell those stories on Twitter Maybe YouTube also then you convert those people to uh to the to the lead magnets really to to the tools to the databases you get you you you get them to uh well you just segment them between um Brands and creators so you essentially create two different lists and then your goal is to nurture both sides of the list and then you create a simple product for them to uh connect connect them connect them so I like this idea but what what I love with um with this kind of products is that you can like all the link tree products they generate a lot of um basically static web pages for clients and if you have things like custom domains and and uh clients have pretty good domains by offering your service for free you can generate a lot of back links by just linking back to your main product on uh the the many many web pages that you create for your clients so you can you can build SEO very fast that way and so all the free SEO optimized tool that you would build would would be able to rank very fast too was SEO a part of your strategy for Tapo and tweet Hunter it was it's it shifted like for the like the first I think the first half of the journey content Twitter and Linkedin was everything and then uh it was just not enough and all the mini tools that we built like I think I think we built more than one per month so at the end we had like 40 SE optimized mini tools and all all them together was bringing like uh were bringing like uh 70% of the of the traffic yeah that's a common thing I hear is like using content to attract initially and always doing that in the background and then using SEO and ads to supercharge as you scale so that's that's yeah but was I think what what what I found the the craziest was like every like we know nothing basically because among all the tools that we built the one that was super well thought like research didn't perform and that the crappy thing that I did an evening based on an ID without even talking to my co-founder about it it just it it it performed above everything like our our best performing mini tun was something that we gave as a test to a developer that we wanted to hire we had no hope no hope on this on this tool and it what was that what was that what was it it was it was download download video from LinkedIn post and and and it it ranked first for this so it was a very low intent uh keyword for Tapo but super high traffic a million per month uh visitors super crazy so people would they would see uh so they download a video and then and then we would say just SCH schedule this on top or schedule this on tweet enter uh to to post twe that's right yeah and for those for people who don't know Tapo is like a is a an AI assisted or an AI tool to help you schedule and manage your LinkedIn so like that makes a lot of sense right the people that are downloading videos are the people that are creating content so you just have to figure out like the prompt for people is whatever it is you're building you have to say what is a free tool that I can go and create that is going to generate a lot of top of the funnel and it's a natur natural for them to use the tool and then use your tool that's that's a strategy that's um a few players were doing that a few years ago like some a company that re inspired us was vi. this this video editor uh what what I what I find Crazy with um how they are doing is is that they have I think they have like 50 tools like things like a crop a video or compress a video but what's what's crazy is that every single one of these twool they take your inputs which is like a video file and then when you upload the when you upload your video they redirects to their main tool like vid doio and you are actually inside the tool without even signing up without paying for anything so it's like it's very cost efficient because it's super easy for them to build a new tool since it's just it's just a feature of their main tool and they and and then you are just like you are inside vi. iio so you just want to use it a little bit more and when you when you want to use a video editor you just think about them you know totally you just gave away a gem someone someone's goingon to listen to that and it's gonna it's going to spend the next 12 months of their lives just building mini tools but I I I hope they are not doing it in the in the video space because I'm going I'm going hard you're going after it's okay I mean there there's room for everyone and I think like everyone has a perspective on it and um but something just just let me add something to this story because everyone out there is saying that Google is dying because of DPT and like perplexity and stuff like that I don't know if that's true or not but one thing that I know for sure is that it's going to be less true for request that are based on an action like if you want if you are looking for a tool uh to compress a video or to download a video from LinkedIn it's very unlikely to me that you're going to query that on tgbt because you are looking for a tool and so you're going to do that on on Google to then be redirected to another tool because that's what you want that's why I think the me tool strategy is still something that I would just double done on I also think that my prediction is tools will be embedded within a lot of these platforms so right now when you use perplexity or use chat gbt really what you're getting back is mostly text you know sometimes you're getting some links or some images and over time what you're going to see is it's going to be more and more rich media from from from these platforms images videos and stuff like that but I think you're really going to start to see tools so you're going to you're going to go on to chat GPT and say you know hey I'm thinking about taking out a 30-year mortgage at 7% my down payment is $150,000 um do you think I should do this or or you know here here's my net worth you know what do you think I should do um today that response is just going to be mostly text um tomorrow what that response is going to be is mostly Tech or some text some image some video and a calculator um that TBO created and you know and then it's going to link back to whatever startup tbos created thus getting him more traffic and then also introducing that person to tbo's Brand it's it's possible but I I don't see an easy way to get there because um because the that like the they they did that with plugins and then they did that with custom gpts and I have no numbers to support what I'm going to say but it seems to me that it's it is a failure and that no no no one is you have slight you you have small use cases when you will use a custom GPT but in most uh most cases you will not totally what do you think I think uh I think it's really I hear what you're saying I mean what have we learned from chat GPT and perplexity is that they scrape a lot of information like llm scrape a lot of information if we assume that they are scraping information I got to think that they're going to scrape tools in the future if and I don't know how they do it and and when I say tomorrow this is going to happen I don't really mean tomorrow but I do mean like within the next five years I think where search engines generally go is where the best possible experience is and I just happen to think that if you embed a tool within a search engine experience IE if you search for something if you have something that you want uh you have a question and you want an answer for it only makes the EXP experience way better if there's a tool to help you figure out the answer to your question what's very true is that Google had absolutely no incentive for doing that before because they they want people to click on links uh which is not the case anymore with with platforms like perplexity and like this the coming search DPT so we'll see maybe you're right yeah in the in the in the past Google was you know fat rich and happy just doing status quo uh but things have changed and now it is a game of user experience so I think knowing that you know why does this matter to the people that that are listening and to me and you is just that okay well if we know that they're going to try to increase user experience what are the things that we need to create such that we get ranked and you know one of those things is tools so I think that's a big insight and uh B based on what you've just said I would I would heavily invest in replying to corra questions and Reddit questions because that's probably where a lot of llms are going to get their their answers and so if you if you're able to be like to the question what's the best um what's the best uh I don't know sushi restaurant in Paris yeah what's the best sushi restaurant in Paris if you able to just plug your restaurants and have it as the top up voted answers on reddits you're going to imagine that imagine that this is gonna pop when people query anms with this with this exact same question that's going to be super powerful yeah and and the mistake I think a lot of people make is they use AI 100 % to answer those questions and going back to user experience that's probably not the best experience because a you know you've seen some of these comments like you you could tell you can tell right now at least um if a if a comment is is AI generated or not I think like the ones that have like stories associated with it I walked into this you know this um the sushi restaurant and in the you know basti neighborhood in uh in Paris and I you know at first like the smell was like horrible and I was like what am I what have I gotten myself into but then I sat down and someone approached me and her name was Jenny and we had this long talk talk about how you know I was in nashima and there was another suan and then I had you know this Toro that was sent to me and it was incredible and it was mouthwatering The Human Experience in in creating content I think is undervalued right now that doesn't mean you have to be 100% uh human generated it just means that combining AI with humans I think is going to be the path forward and I do agree that answering questions is is UN is underrated it's super funny that you're saying that because we I had I had these debates um very short time ago and my my first reaction to this was like it's it's this is just that AI is not good enough for for now but I don't see why with even even without better LMS but with proper context and prep proper instruction I don't see how you would not have a a better system that would reply exactly like you just said the the key thing is to have like a human touch human emotions and um um errors like you have you have to make it super super willing to do to to go in crazy ways in like very original stuff but I don't see how this would not happen so it'll always be a cat and mouse game between the llms and content my I don't know if you notice that but I like I'm I'm following very closely this guy like level CEO on on Twitter and and he's started doing something that's I find a bit crazy is every time he thinks that someone answers with an AI reply to his tweets he just block and and I I just couldn't stop thinking like what's what's his error rates like how many how many people he blocking thinking that they are like Ai and they are not I mean I think that he the a I mean there's the average person if the average person did that you know they would probably be a lot of mistakes or a good amount of mistakes Le you know Peter levels probably not I mean there's this one guy who follow who has a well-known podcast who was an executive at one of the biggest tech companies in the world and he replies to all my LinkedIn or a lot of my LinkedIn posts and Twitter posts and it's 100% AI generated and I've been meaning I've been thinking about I've been like should I reach out to this guy like I've met him twice but should I re reach out to this guy and be like hey dude like it is so obvious that you're using some AI tool and it's like really really hurting your brand like you are an executive of like a multi hundred billion dollar company I think in the in the B2B space don't do like it's very just don't do it I don't think so I don't think it's worth it being 100% but so okay going back to what I was saying cat and mouse number one number two is okay cat and mouse and and and and text becomes so good that it's almost indistinguishable well then photos and videos are going to be valued highly so not only will you have to create text about that sushi sushi restaurant experience but you'll have to actually take a photo of that Toro and they're going to be able to tell is that a photo taken from an iPhone at this point 20 an iPhone 20 and and were you actually sitting there um or was it you know created with Dolly 8 at this point yeah but like even that I so I I was I was super surprised when I saw this tweet of someone uh sharing m j prompts and and he said that by by adding like iPhone photos you get you much more realistic contents from M Johnny but not not in a beautiful way but like more like in a crappy way like the the crappy way that you would take a photo at a restaurant because it's like the you are moving or uh it's not properly cropped things like that like it's it's a little bit um I don't know how to say that but in Reverse or see my point yeah yeah anyway any I I I just I I don't know where we are going with this but uh it's going to be fun to watch it's going to be fun to watch I think where we're going with it like we'll move on to your next idea but I think it's just like you kind of want to the upside of of you doing sorry go ahead but maybe that's that's the next ID because like imagine imagine building a suite of tool where like the the content the content that you will publish is like certified no AI like the the product itself is an anti- AI uh positioning because using this tool you are like certified to be a genuine human using a tool by hand yeah I mean Scott bsky the chief product officer of adobe once told me that uh just this idea around when you walk into a grocery store you see uh labels and on the labels you could see what's in the product right you can see if there's seed oils you can see if there's water you can see how much sugar there is all these things and when it comes to social products and digital products we don't really have nutrition labels and when it comes to content we definitely don't have nutrition labels we just see the content now Instagram is doing and Tik Tok is are doing uh you know this video was made by with this filter so there is a little bit of you can see this video was made by this filter so there's starting to be like the nutrition label but it's very just tip of the iceberg the idea that you're talking about which is like essentially organic content just like how we have organic food and non-organic content um which is AI generated is really compelling I just don't know how you create a business out of it it's it's a good question like I I I was just wondering if you could have like a some kind of it it would not be a a label but some kind of like Twitter scheduler like like twit was like which she would enjoy promoting publicly because it doesn't have ai I I'm I'm wondering if we'll not see a suite of products coming in the next few years which are like no AI in that no no AI in them but they still need to be grds but but by not having AI to gener to generate contents people would just be happy to promote them because they would be promoting themselves as no AI users I think one of the reasons why we saw be real hit like 20 million Deus or whatever it was was because you were seeing the rise of filters and AI content exactly and that that product was you know it ended up not really working out but it the reason I think it took off is there was like this feeling Collective feeling that we all had that we were getting sick and tired of of filters and and AI content so that Insight I think is really good how that manifests into a business I think probably probably there's probably a social app idea like there's probably a another version of a social network that exists that just encapsulates everything that we hate about social networks today which is a generated filters uh negative places so just you know when I go I was just on Twitter right before this and it was just like I'm seeing like video like horrible videos of war and and and people arguing about politics um and 100% organic content I think uh would be would be the answer so I think the way I think that there's the ideas I have for this is you either create a social network um hard to do have to raise money um so good luck um or you build Services businesses that help companies create organic content subscription based um content type type of ideas um for people I I can't I'm you know off the top of my head that's all I got yeah but this this ID keeps me keeps me very buy you know because I'm I'm working on this uh tool I don't know if you notice like it's called superx do so it's a it's like a Twitter extension for it's a Chrome extension for x and I think it has like the the best analytics uh features like I've I've never I've I've not seen anything uh closing enough to Super X but then since is a Chrome extension comes this idea of generating replies with AI and if you do that you are instantly categorized as a gray hat tool that speed shady and that will uh that will um make make Twitter way worse by just having more shitty contents and so I really I really I'm really thinking about like having this antii positioning yeah totally anti positioning that's a key inside I got to think more about that one um I think I think you are right on that I don't know let say I I think so I got a good feeling about it because um like I said it's people are thinking about it and there's going to be benefits to there are benefits to going anti- aai just like there's benefits going AI right I'm not saying like going AI is bad I'm just saying there's some places that it it makes sense and some places it doesn't and there's so much competition in the AI assisted AI Le landscape that there's probably a lot of opportunity in the human stuff and and and because of this competition people are burning outs like Lev and Danny posma posted about this on on X they they said that for sure the their next product will be like a no AI product just because of the insane competition they have just by talking about their the AI products the day they do so you have like 10 competitors for sure that will jump on the ID exactly you know you're not having a lot of you know you're not having 10 uh competitors in in anti- AI human stuff that's for sure yep so that's that's where the Arbitrage is always look for the Arbitrage always look where there's opportunity um so I like that for this I would I would have a look at what uh the people people behind behind um base camp are doing like uh Jason freed yeah exactly uh th those guy like the they did this um once Studio charging onetime fees for uh products I would not be surprised if they continue doing no AI tools and I would be very interested in what their I I I would look for what their next product will be totally yeah I'm I'm I'm following them and I I do think they're really good at sniffing out how people are feeling IE yeah and and doing these like anti- positioning yeah anti positioning is just it's so so underrated so underrated cuz you know when you're posting something on Twitter if everything looks the same you're not going to stop and and you're just going to keep keep scrolling but when you see something that's in the zeitgeist and just feels smells tastes different then then you're stopping you're sharing you're replying you're engaging so that's where the Arbitrage is tibo this has been really fun you're a legend where could people find find more more about you and your products uh the easiest is on X I'm tibo and thecore maker there um and my um my best products like the the the one that keeps me busy right now is revid doai it's a video editor to BR short form videos I hope that uh people will like it cool yeah check it out uh obviously you know what time it is go to YouTube like this video comment on video so people hear more about t TBO and his great ideas um hope this has been fun and tibo good seeing you and uh hopefully next time in France or here in Quebec I would love to welcome you here thank you GRE it was very awesome later [Music]

and I still think like this is this is possible now this is like the Apple iOS store basically back in the day where there was nothing there was nothing yet there weren't apps you could literally make money by just making a flashlight app a calculator app a fart app whatever like this is the Golden Age of AI and SEO combined with each other and this is probably not even going to work in two years anymore cuz all these niches are going to be found they're going to be filled in by people just doing all these things cuz it feels like with SEO like I don't know what your experience with it is like with the first to market the first to build the backlinks the first to get the like the domain names and stuff they will mostly stay on the top of the market in that sense yeah I agree with you like you know this is one of those things where it's a window of opportunity and I almost was shocked that you shared it because this is a pretty lowrisk high impact idea that a really really small team could do there's a couple things I look at when I'm like should I go into the space and one of them is [Music] that's true I was telling Danny that you know this 8:00 a.m. for me and like I don't take meetings this early just cuz I like to wake up get into the deep creative flow but for Danny you make exceptions nice I don't take any meetings after 600 and this is 8:00 p.m. for me normally I already be sleeping cuz we wake up at 5:00 I got a dog scratching my face at 5:00 p.m. in the morning uh but I obviously make a exception for Greg in his podcast so I appreciate it so what do you got for us today yeah what do you uh what do you want to spitball about what what ideas do you I've been listening to a few episodes and I think everyone is just rambling on good ideas so uh you probably know what your audience is most interested in I I put like a few things in it I I I want to start with the AI ins insert keyword generator I think that's really interesting cool so you would just like to me to like just explain the idea how I would do it how to start yep cool so um I think so a little background about me I'm really big in SEO and I'm big in uh programming in the sense like combining those things and using AI so um I just love to log into hrs.com typee in some random keywords and basically figure out where there's a lot of search intent and very low keyword difficulty um basically H gives you like uh it gives a score between zero and 100 if it's on 100 it's really hard to compete in you don't want to do with it if it's on zero it basically shows there's no competition you could basically make a website for it and rank pretty quickly so you want to find keywords that are easy to rank for right the issue used to be that you have to then make the website F the content and stuff like that so for example I had a website Ling folio.com which is a website inspiration Galler you can rank pretty quickly on that back in the days but it takes you a lot of time to make the content but now with AI man you can just rapid fire and let things generate in that sense so what I would do and what we do a lot and I've done this before with uh AI tattoos so that's why I said like AI keyword generator for example you could do like AI tattoos if you go into hvf you log in and you basically type in uh tattoos you will get thousands and thousands and thousands of longtail keywords for for example for like butterfly tattoo or um Dragon Tattoo bird tattoo there is like thousands and thousands of those what you then can do is basically use AI use stable diffusion use mid Journey whatever the the latest hype is right now and basically just start generating all that content and start filling these pages and automatically start building these dire directories of like um butterfly tattoos where you put like all these tattoo examples of butterflies on and basically that way organically grow your website and then make a tool where users can do that them paid and use that content to display on the website again so it's basically user generated content using AI to fill your website and within a month you're probably going to generate like hundreds of thousands of pieces of content Google's going to love it Google's going to going to send traffic towards it and this is for example we did it with a tattoo and I think we hit like 10,000 mrr before I sold it because I was focusing on on another startup but you can do this for probably anything um that's AI related combined with low roow difficulty content yeah and you could I mean you could spin up in agency I know you're not a huge agency fan to in terms of businesses but you can spin up an agency where it's like we'll actually go and build this for you and we'll build some of these products so there's there's like a lower ticket idea here where it's just access to the tool and then there's a higher ticket of like a done for you service so you would because you have a you have a SEO agency right like is this something you could offer like would you like why wouldn't you do it yourself for your own content for your own cont so we actually have been building a suite of we've been building a lot of this stuff and so you're talking about boring marketing.com so we we've been quietly just like building a lot of these uh tools so this is the direction we're going in so yes I mean I'm a Believer you know I'm invested in it and the beauty about this is once you once you capture an entrepreneur who's who's like who wants to build one of these ideas they need more than just SEO they need uh a bunch of different services and you can build the and tools they need a bunch of tools and they need a bunch of services so um it's a super high valued potential customer and that's the way to think about it right is like you you want to think about how do I build a business with a high Valu customer and this is like one one great way to do it yeah and I still think like this is this is possible now this is like the Apple iOS store basically back in the day where there was nothing there was nothing yet that weren't apps you could literally make money by just making a flashlight app a calculator app a fart app whatever like this is the goal age of AI and SEO combined with each other and this is probably not even going to work in two years anymore because all these niches are going to be found they're going to be filled in by people just doing all these things because it's all highly automated right so now being able because it feels like with SEO like I don't know what your experience with it is like the first to market the first to build the backlinks the first to get their like the domain names and stuff they will mostly stay on the top of the market in that sense yeah yeah I agree with you like you know this is one of those things where it's a window of opportunity quick ad break let me tell you about a business I invested in it's called boring marketing.com so a few years ago I met this group of people that were some of the best SEO experts in the world they were behind getting some of the biggest companies found on Google and the secret sauce is they've got a set of technology and AI that could help you outrank your competition so for my own businesses is I wanted that I didn't want to have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I didn't want to depend on ads to drive customers to my businesses I wanted to rank high in Google that's why I like SEO and that's why I use boring marketing.com and that's why I invested in it they're so confident in their approach that they offer a 30-day Sprint with 100% money back guarantee who does that nowadays so check it out highly recommend boring marketing.com um even um I won't say the exact term but even uh today actually this morning I was there there was a particular idea I want to go build that I was on uh a few tools including a ah refs yeah you call a name yeah it's hard it's hard I just I type it I don't say it saying it especially at 8 a.m. is like with like one sip of coffee like oh my God it's hard so don't judge me people listening but um dude the the window is gone like it's gotten i' I've just seen it over the last like four weeks just get increasingly more and more competitive and now I'm kind of like I don't know if I want to do this idea anymore yeah it feels like you can have like it's the same with my company right head shot Pro um we do AI head shot generation like when we started out there were like three four competitors and then suddenly like these AI boiler plates came out and there will be 1,000 competitors trying to build the same idea I do believe like everyone is gone now again mostly because clicks are going to be too high it's to high to rank for it there's too much competition so the top three will always win U we got lucky that we're in the top three with right now so I do think you can still compete in like in a busy Market but you got to be fast man I don't think you can if it comes to that AI stuff I don't think you can come in a year later and try to merge your way into it it's it's it's probably too late with those kind of tools that's why I'm saying you you you got to be like you got to be on eight refs you got to find those niches the keywords that haven't been utilized yet that are like on zero to five keyword difficulty in both those things before it's too late because in two years it's not going to be the Gold Rush is going to be over I I think it's going to be too late at that sense so yeah H yeah the Gold Rush is gonna be over and Danny is gonna be dressed in an all gold suit with a gold presidential Rolex and a gold man I'm I'm too busy I I can't do that stuff that's why we got to share the ideas here man no you're you I think you're you're doing all the right things so um I wouldn't be surprised um let's go let's move over to our Idea Idea number two the comfy UI Marketplace man how how how technically is your audience before I'm going to go super technical terms here they're they're mostly non-technical but uh there are it is a subset of people who who get it like you know Indie hackers building stuff so that crew will understand what you're saying all right so how am I going to translate this to everyone that can understand okay so before when I started like two years ago if you want to do anything with machine learning that's deeper like in with AI That's deeper than just calling chat GPT you had to write python right uh python is a language where every every AI stuff is built in uh pyth and whatever like you need to write the code I think a few months ago and I found about this two weeks ago which which is I'm pretty late to the party it's called com UI and it's basically just a really nice interface that has a drag and drop you can just drag in notes um that you can connect to other notes and you can basically just build a visual pipeline where you have inputs you do something with the data and you have outputs with it so a lot of like I'm now rebuilding all my python stuff to com for UI because it's so much easier to work with it's so much better to work with you can just also run it in the cloud now and replic but what I've seen lately is a lot of YouTubers are actually making tutorials on how to build these workflows so what if instead of all these YouTube tutorials there will be a com vui marketplace where people can just basically sell these templates um that they build because you can export it you can save it you can export it you can rent them out you can let people use it and basically charge like a fee for it um I think in the next few months this is going to be huge I think a lot of people going to move to comy UI there's a lot of tools being built now that allow you to really easily work with it I think this is going to be the next the next kind of wave in AI right now that we're going to migrate there and there's a ton of Indie hackers man that sell boiler plates for for programming for codes I'm pretty sure you can like capitalize on this with comy UI if I wasn't busy this is the idea I would be working on we're too [ __ ] busy so I'm not going to do it so uh there must be someone in your audience that can stop working on this I uh I saw this when this was in your list and I almost was shocked that you shared it yeah because this is this is a pretty lowrisk high impact idea that a really really small team could do um one of the there's two things there's a couple things I look at when I'm like should I go into the space and one of them is is there an influx of YouTube tutorials so I've also noticed the same thing there's been a hugee increase in the tutorial space in this space and it's kind of like that guy uh what's his name ELO in the notion template space so there's a YouTuber who has like I don't know half a million YouTube subs and the guy's like printing millions of dollars a year selling YouTube templates like you just apply that model to this and the and the second thing I I noticed with um with comfyi in general is they uh their sub Reddit has has skyrocketed in terms of uh membership so it's now top you know 3 or 4% subreddit which is just a sign that there's something here it feels like every smart person I see on Twitter is kind of working on this the reason I was keeping this one secret and but this morning was walking with a dog and like I'm not allowed to work on another idea anymore I need to stop doing it because I've been so busy with all my other stuff so I'm like thinking all right how am I I want this cuz we this stuff I would love more templates how am I going to stop myself but still bring it in the world I was like I'm just going to share it on the podcast I don't yeah just it needs to exist and I think someone's going to print absolute money with this yeah yeah it needs to exist and I will say though your audience is like pretty perfect for something like this um would you ever consider partnering with someone I'm so this is funny cuz one and a half year ago you told me to stop start doing something with my Ai influencer and I started doing it and it turned into head shot Pro so maybe we're on an Affliction point where Greg tells me go do this yourself and like it builds into the next big business but yeah I've been thinking about like I'm too busy should I just partner up with people use my audience like a lot of Indie heckers like a lot of people doing these days um partner up in that sense so if someone's listening here they got some skills and I want to partner up H me on Twitter I think it's going to be in show notes later yes I'll be I will yeah I mean why not right like the I think that's just an interesting thing for creators this is kind of like a side tangent but like if you're a Creator or you're someone with an audience who has a access to an audience of course you want to work on your own ideas and you want to focus on your own ideas but how do you partner and just take pieces of businesses where you can there's someone that you trust that's going to go in like build this thing so you know I don't know what equity percentage that is like if you take 30% 40% 50% what that is but there's probably a deal that you can make there do you have do you have experience in this do you have you seen people start doing this um successfully With Their audience and their brand yeah I mean like the Nick Hubers the Sha pories the sthill blooms those those people you know Austin Reef with oceans co-founder of morning Brew it's it's happening um I haven't done it a lot myself um because the truth is I haven't been able to find like people I really trust and I'm scared to work with someone who is going to blow it for me right so um I I I I do like I do I'm making a conscious effort to like meet interesting entrepreneurs so hopefully I can partner with them and and and uh and bring them into the late checkout ecosystem yeah yeah it's hard do it man you need you need to have a whole combination of a person you're going to work with it's not just like yeah they need to be entrepreneurial so why wouldn't they do it by themselves um how would you partner up with someone start a company with them yeah it's a big step you have to offer something more than just an audience in my opinion like um so like my offering to to people is like Capital design SEO paid ads um audience um but yeah you do one or two of my point is if you do one or two of those a year that really work out like you're good you know you're good but then the thing is like do you want to be completely distracted from what else you're working on and like focus on those parts if you have like a busy business I think it that sense yeah like for me for example I'm still in the running in my company I've got a team right but I'm still like working full-time on it like being able to support another business is that like something you want to work on that's the thing do you want to sacrifice more of your free time after so many years of doing that so that's like Reflection Point to me it's it's really it's high leverage work to do that you're essentially advising someone else and if you're you or you're me or you're or frankly you're listening to this podcast you have an unfair Advantage at because you know where the world is going so if you know where the world is going it's like how can you I mean we talked about this last time a year and a half ago when you came on the Pod it was like I was like dude how are you not building doubling down on this and doubling down there some big companies doing that now so uh yeah one half years ago you told me go start this EI influencer ageny whatever man people are doing big stuff in that space yeah yeah so that's that's kind of like the hold Co model and and and it doesn't necessarily need to be incubate everything yourself you can just you know partner with someone um all right I want to move on to the next idea Fiverr upwork 2.0 yeah so I don't think anyone has built anything like this yet or at least it doesn't feel like it so basically FIV upor obviously freelance platform right uh you go there you want to have a job done you you find a freelancer and you work for it basically all the time tracking goes Fe the platform too so it's uh yeah with AI it feels like a lot of these jobs don't exist anymore because most of the things are automated but what I think where they should go and I don't even know if they're doing this yet or if they can't doing it yet but what people there's a difference now if if you want to heavily use AI you you need to be a programmer right you need to build your own apis you cannot just like only put it in ch gbt it's going to be to hard so what I would build is basically a clone of Fiverr or upwork but you don't hire people you basically hire mlms uh llms AI Bots and whatever basically workflows that have been built for you that can do the work for you but it doesn't feel like you're working with AI it literally just feels like you're hiring someone to do it but it's not the person it's the ey doing it for example I think before you would go to upor for for like a translation job right so you have an Excel sheet you dump you find a freelancer he's going to translate it and you get the stuff back later this could be now 100% automated you don't need a person to do this anymore but I think a lot of like normies regular people they might be afraid of AI so if you just literally make a job website where you can go and there's literally a translate option you drop your Excel and then a day later for example you get your Excel sheet back that's translated and the again it's all AI doing it it's like 100% AI it's automated I think that would be so much easier to sell and it's basically just yeah the future of working the future of jobs someone in the comment section is going to be like but why wouldn't you just use Google [Laughter] Translate probably because Google Translate is not good enough and someone doesn't want to put 10,000 rows of excel in a Google translate that's thing you either got to buil the API yourself and need to know how to program or you going to go to upw work and let someone else do it you're going to be the person that literally already built the API but you're going to make it feel like it's up and that's the other thing is Big especially bigger companies they want automations so they want the ability to be like okay I put this in an air table and anytime I put it into an air table this air table like this task is made and with it I know that within 24 hours there's going to be the output and to me it's worth paying whatever it is per month or per t ask because now of a sudden I don't I don't have the worry that if I put it in Google Translate that it's going to be messed up I can like trust this Source well and it's also like you don't want to babysit it right you don't want to check it you don't want to fact check it you don't want to see if it's working you basically just want to dump your stuff give the task you want to get back what you paid for and don't use your time in that sense um that's kind of a good name for this dumpy stuff.com let's see is it is it is it already taken dumpy stuff.com yeah and then the logo could be like a toilet or something you know don't you can have your own AI translate dumpy stuff.com is taken man I'm so sorry damn what about dumpy stuff. AI though yeah aai 80 bucks per year you can register it I it so the first it but last time I said a name it was like registered like one minute after I uploaded the Pod you got some good listeners man yeah but I think this one is excited I'm just like just like gradually build it out I'm pretty sure you can just have a community maybe this is should be built on top of comi you can have a community buildt out these workflows offer it as a service and then you just charge a fee over it so for example you can have some random guy in San Francisco so he's going to build uh these translation servers for example you run Fe the platform as a platform you change like a 5% fee and he charges you like one cent per row or whatever so he can basically like offer his AI worker on the platform automated you get a feel over it and it's basically just this whole economy that just works in that way if you wanted to build this app how would you go about getting customers to it I I would probably just go on upor and just offering it as a service there and I know they have a whole Banning Blacklist system against scrapers but there is I know someone who made a work around around it so it's doable you can basically just like Airbnb did this right they made fake efforts on Craiglist that's right for their hosts and then just to fill the platform you can just seat your platform in that way that's right yeah no one talks about that but that's exactly how they initially scaled and I'm and the thing is you can just go on upw work you can see what is the most requested job that people offer or require over there you can just automate it so the data is already there you just have to yeah you can just apply to the jobs offer it as a service I think it's pretty easy to be scalable perhaps you need some like real humans in the mix that need to do the checking like maybe like some some account manager that like checks the output of the job eventually so you need to hire like someone via somewhere. comom nice plug for our friends uh to to do the managing and whatever yeah I uh I also think this is one of those ideas that you start you know you start scaling it you get a bunch of press someone you know the the the VP of m&a at Fiverr or up works like sees it and it's like I need to buy this thing because they must need like I was expecting honestly them them to start doing something with this but I have not seen any of these two companies mentioning maybe maybe they're afraid of the backlash because they run on the freelances right so you don't want to get rid of that I know the stock is down 95% since 2022 I bought some upwork stock and I went to absolute [ __ ] so uh they got to do something I guess why is it down revenues are down I haven't checked probably revenues down uh 2020 bubble pops but I'm pretty sure also people probably just expected they are low-level task right like their task are automatable by AI so there must be like investors must be super scared like where's the revenue potential yeah I just I just checked on perplexity thatai why is up work up workk stock down um there's been a decrease of Revenue um so less people definitely AI concerns there are fears the rise of generative AI could eliminate many of freelance jobs it's it's not going to eliminate freelance jobs it's going to eliminate low you know sort of lower repetitive freelance jobs and because of this lower guidance so they're giving lower guidance because they're I mean the real big idea honestly is you you do a hostile takeover of up work like you you figure out a way to buy up work well you know that's the big idea of this they would probably buy you out like if you can make this work successfully they need to they need to stay cuz they probably have ton of cash on the hand because they didn't IPO that long ago they must be they are going to acquire you if you if you make this work yes yeah dude like my heart is hurting because this is such a good idea the company the company is worth $1.5 billion but they've got about $500 million of cash so the company's only worth a billion dollars on like how much revenue let's check real quick yeah dude I'm telling you if I if I didn't have hup Pro I will be working on this but I'm too busy with it so so they used to be worth probably 20 20 billion crazy so in 2023 they had $689 million of Revenue so they're basically basically being traded at almost 1X Revenue like 1.2 1.3x Revenue so Fiverr is the one that went down that badly yeah fiver went down from 320 USD to now TW 25 so it's down 10 times crazy upwork is doing upwork is doing okay because upw is probably also more up yes like they're doing more harder task and five is like literally made for the $5 Tas right yeah so they they in problem so this is this is yeah there's a bunch of ways to to come out at this problem either you go and I think the best way if I was doing this I would just go and and build what you're saying and then you're going to build a cash flowing business but you can also decide to sell it to them dude but this is the thing this is like the the the thing that I try to focus on now and this is probably a bridge to the next idea I'm not sure if I put it on there but you gota like you got to humanize AI in that sense and what I think everything is now Tech based but that's nice for the 1% of on understand stack but you need to like make it if you want to get products to be adopted you need to make it feel like the real world right basically how iPhone started with their interface notes look like notes um you need to make it feel right so these people they're not going to use CAD GPT to do the job even if it's easier they you need to like they want to use it how they've been using it but then on a different way for example like hop Pro we really we don't focus on the AI part we basically just what we do different is before you had to go to a physical photo shoot right so you had to schedule photo shoot you have to drive there you have to get your clothing you have to pay $300 basically what we do now is you just do it from your house you take 15 selfies and the AI is literally the photographer that makes it for you and 2 hours later you get the photo it's kind of the same process and we make it feel the same way but there's no real human in the loop but basically 50 photographers in the cloud that are making the photos for it so it feels like you need to make that transition you need to make it feel human how you experienced it so I think like these kind of ideas stop doing it as an API do it more as like a job Marketplace because it feels real it feels how people expect to interact with something they've been interacting with right so yeah let's talk about that idea so you've done that for headshot Pro and millions of headshots are created per month do you how would you go about thinking about another another type of service like headshot Pro for X there was a I was listening to podcast the other day and they for example company doctors apparently have scripes that are taking notes and how it used to work I don't know which podcast this was on but it was a really good episode probably um I think it was my first million they mentioned it on there so basically they said this doctor had a scrip so before they would be in person now they hired someone that was listening in from an iPad someone was literally asking hey who's that on the iPad and you were like oh that's my scribe he's listening and he's taking notes of this recording the next step is you need to find ideas that you could literally automate with AI right so this person like it's it's going to be T like people don't like to hear it but this person is going to be automated by AI because you have open AI whisper it can literally transcribe what you're saying you use another llm to summarize it and you're done so this person their job is going to be gone in five years so this is like a job you could automate like you could Target doctor practices describes literally Market it as that service but then instead of doing the service as before you you replace it with AI but you still sell it is that way so you say um yeah would you Market it you you would you brand it like you would just use the same kind of content you don't even need to mention AI anywhere but you just make it 10 times cheaper so I met a doctor recently and I was telling him a little bit of what I do and he was like oh you're interested in AI I'm like yeah he goes I started using this thing called autoscribe nice what's autoscribe he's like he said the same thing he was like yeah we used to you know you know how bad doctor's notes are you worst handwriting on the planet I was like yeah he goes now I just have this app it's I'm I'm in a beta test with them I'll I'll send you the link here yeah Tonto California has one yeah it's a Toronto yeah it's a Montreal Toronto company I think dude it's a wild there's nothing else ranking for this search term it's just Toronto yeah it's called Uh yeah autoscribe but you go to their website it's m like I can't even spell it mew2 health but if you Google autoscribe should come up anyways the way he he goes what it does is uh it's real time transcription and he was like I can't tell you how okay actually here I'm on the website this is what happens the patient consents to autoscribe then it records it in the room um then it populates uh in real time the information during the encounter cuz keep in mind the doctor is looking at a screen that almost looks like a CRM and it needs to be popular ated um in real time then there's an analysis that happens autoscribe creates a clinical note based on the encounter um once reviewed and editing is complete the no can be pushed to the EMR or copy and pasted so it's like a pretty simple idea he told me that he he was like I'm I'm able to see 10 to 20% more patients per day and the thing is like even if he's tired and he didn't hear what they said critical information there is this AI that just found out what people actually said and it's going to summarize for them afterwards like so it's going to help so many people man exactly help so many people um so yeah I mean I think you kind of just have to yeah's one compe there's like one there's one company that does this there's no competition like just finding like little niches where this works where you can just replace what's normally be done by a human and like it done by AI to make enable more people to use it because now every doctor can have it instead of only the rich doctors in rich countries for example yeah and I think what you need to do is you have to understand workflows of of people practitioners so you have to like call your dentist call your auto mechanic call your you know Barber and you have to be like hey what are the things that you do that's really repetitive that you hate doing and this is the nice thing you fairly have no competition cuz if you're going to make a note app every programmer can make a note app but no one is going to make an AI app for a doctor or whatever there's no there's no competition in it because it's boring they don't know anything about it so if you spend your time doing it you will have you're gonna have the whole Market if you know how to skill and how to do marketing totally and you know another ideas is okay there's a doctor but what what are other people that doctors work with well what about the what about the nurse is there something specific to nurses like nurses scribe doai is that available I don't know if nurses you scribe but yeah but even like maybe for like a dentist or not even a doctor maybe for a completely different different subject yeah I know a friend of mine for example he was doing all these AI note taking apps became popular right so he started doing it for feter veterinarians veterinarians yeah there was no competition but all these fats would love to have their notes taken and just have it in their app but because you target it specifically for that Niche they would rather use that than a more broadly consumer based app crazy dude yeah there's so many opportunities man but you gotta be fast like I said in the beginning of the podcast I I this is going to be gone in the next two to five years like SAS is already eat the world like everything is done basically uh this is going to be saturated in five to 10 years too give us one before you go give us one last idea I think I got the whole docs the whole document done already right was there anything else yeah um yeah I would do this so I my my first startup I sold it to Jasper um which was a AI copyrighting generator I still think you can do this for uh you can just make a marketing agency and have it run completely on AI without people knowing it so for example I have this domain for a long time a headline 99 where basically you could just write headlines for people that landing pages for $99 I haven't been able to do it yet you can just send people questionary they fill in all the deals about the company you have a bunch of different llms summarizing it making headlines getting five to 10 ideas put a human in the loop that literally picks the last three Mones and you give the best performing best working headline for the landing page and a headline can be like doubling your Revenue if you have a good headline so you get productize services like everyone is using software and SAS now but you have to remember these people using the software like they don't know anything so you need to you need to productize the extra layer on top of it you're probably doing that with boring marketing now with with the blog writing whatever everyone is doing with his blocks but I think there's so many different angles you could go into this and just basically build a marketing agency that skills to probably a billion dollar in Revenue without having a single human sitting there just probably just one guy which just many using all the terminal commands and checking if everything goes well yeah I mean there's a lot there and that it just goes into like the unbundling of the marketing agency and productizing it and creating these sort of autonomous SAS apps basically um that's that's that's a process that's just begun to start so yeah I think there's a big opportunity I think the smartest thing you did was calling it headline 99 like that that's brilliant I I just love the domain man I I I really I need to stop working on it because I really like the domain name I have something with Hats head pro headline headline 99 it's like all the project with that word in it are successful so I got to stick with that plan Danny all right uh you know you've given a lot of value we appreciate it if people want to support you and follow along where can they do that get a AI headshot on headshot pro.com and go follow me on Twitter it's where I share what I'm working on ideas and stuff like that uh so my Twitter is Denny postma with a double a at the end on Twitter in the show and if you like this episode you want more Danny uh like comment subscribe share this episode uh so we know that you you you like Danny I know I like Danny so it's always it's always pleasure seeing you brother maybe see you again in one and a half year and we do completely different things and I build a comy UI one let's see oh yeah well you'll be wearing a crown and hopefully I'll be wearing a crown too so exactly thanks for having me man was fun always fun later dude [Music]

In this episode, we explore 8 standout startup ideas from Dani Grant’s list of 139. I’ll break down why each idea has potential or pitfalls and share the frameworks and strategies I’d use to grow these businesses.

Here are the most interesting ones (with my takes):

1) Product Spec Doc SaaS 

• Google Docs for PMs
•  Pricing Potential: $20/mo
• Partner with PM influencers (e.g. Lenny Rachitsky )

• Solid idea, but needs influencer partner to succeed.

2) Developer Portfolio Site Builder

• Like Format but for devs
• $15/mo avg per user, low churn
• Start by designing for influencer devs
• Build MVP after refining the concept
• Great cash flow biz. Niche website builders still work in 2024!

3) Blog + Newsletter in a Box 

•  Set up blogs like Fred Wilson’s AVC
• Use existing tools (Substack, WordPress)
• One-time fee, cold outreach model
• Good side hustle. Keep it simple, don't try to be Substack 2.0.

4) JSFiddle Meets Twitter 

• Social code sharing + memes
• Devs love to remix and share
• Build on existing dev culture
• Compelling idea. Devs crave better social tools.

5) Shopify for X

the next idea Shopify for X I think Shopify is an80 billion company and when you have an80 billion company there's just opportunities to unbundle it so what is Danny what's Danny's idea so she says there are all these no code tools they're either too limited or too complex what you need is a product specific tool like Shopify is no code ecomerce then you would also build no code marketplaces this is such a good idea this is such a good idea uh something like this needs to exist should exist will exist and how would I actually go and build something like this well i' build [Music] that okay so a few weeks ago I had Danny Grant on the podcast and she's someone who I really respect sometimes you meet someone or you're listening to someone's podcast or you're watching them and you you you just know that this person's got it they've got the sauce they know where the world is going and uh she had a few ideas that she shared but afterward she sent me a list of 139 different startup ideas and we never got a chance to go through them so I figured I'd hop on here real quick go through some of these ideas some of them are kind of big Ventra back ideas some of them are profitable startups um and some of them will just get get your creative Juices Flow in and I'll will tell you how I feel about these ideas what would I do how would I start them and if I just think that they're plain garbage you know some of these ideas I might be like you know what I wouldn't maybe maybe it's a good idea but it's one of those ideas I wouldn't do too much work so without further Ado let's go into Danny Grant's 139 ideas let's pick the most interesting ones or the ones that just speak to me and uh let's go through this together and uh and see what we what we got all right so this idea idea number one is there a product DOC format just for writing product specs so you can create jira's inline you can have common threads in line Etc this is pretty darn good idea you know there is Google Docs of course um but there it's there's nothing specific for product spec so I I can imagine a Google docs for product specs for PMS that people would be willing to pay $20 a month for so I actually think that there's something here I really like this idea uh it's not one it's not the simplest idea to do like you actually you have to create software um I don't think really anything like this exists I mean of course you have product templates um but you don't really have a whole experience dedicated to writing product specs and how would I actually go and build something like this well i' build the MVP probably Outsource it to um an agency to get the MVP up and I'd partner with a Creator I mean Lenny ritky would be the dream so Lenny ritky uh I think at this point has the biggest podcast and newsletter for product managers but you know who are the aspiring Lenny ritzes so I'd make a list I'd go to perplexity doai and I'd say you know who are the upand cominging 20 um 20 Lenny ritzes and uh and I would go and reach out to them so uh I think this is a good idea pretty straightforward software uh catchy catchy name uh you know I wouldn't I probably wouldn't do this idea if I didn't have the Buy on Buy in from two to three or four creators so I would I would create the name I'd create the mockup first and then I would actually go and see if I want to build it all right so that's that's idea number one idea number two developer portfolio sites so she says help every developer create their own Danny town I assume Danny town is her own portfolio uh website so there's a company called format.com and what they do is they're the portfolio builder for Creative professionals um so basically what Danny's suggesting is build the format.com but for Developers now I know someone's listening to this and being like well that's GitHub GitHub already exists um yes but it's not as beautiful as a format and I do think that there's an opportunity to build that for developers and format's actually massive they've got 50,000 plus people uh who pay to use it and what do they pay to use it pricing was pulled up they pay $1 a month annually or $24 a month uh monthly so this is a huge business if you assume that um you know the average is let's say $15 a month you know that's huge you know we're talking $750,000 in monthly recurring revenue for something that you know doesn't cost a lot of money and why I love websites website Builders is once you build it chances are you are not going to churn so these are beautiful businesses that don't churn very well I think Danny's on to something uh with developer portfolio sites I do think uh it makes sense and you can probably take again you can take that Lenny ritky strategy you know Creator Le there are a bunch of developers who have a lot of followers and I'd work with them to create uh something that would be really cool so I think the way I would actually build something like this is I would start by building one really awesome developer portfolio site so um I would reach out to uh some of these developers and say hey uh I'm a designer um I'd really love to design you your own developer for folio site and uh and create something unique interesting um that they've that hopefully never seen before get them super stoked about it and once you refine that you know maybe you do it for a few people then that's when you have the product and then you know that's when you uh get some of these influencer developers on board that's when you can actually go and build out an MVP minimal viable product and start charging for this so I really love this idea uh these are one of the uh a great cash flow um ideas uh I remember meeting the founder of card C a.co I think he has he had a great business their onepage websites he doesn't he charges very little I think it's like nine bucks a year or something but he had a great business he bootstrapped it one guy one guy uh living in Tennessee developer and millions of people use this it's crazy so uh website Builders I know you must be thinking like oh my God that's so 1999 but it works it really works and it works really well for uh different niches so really good idea on that one quick ad break let me tell you about a business I invested in it's called boring marketing.com so a few years ago I met this group of people that were some of the best SEO experts in the world they were behind getting some of the biggest companies found on Google and the secret sauce is they've got a set of technology and AI that could help you outrank your competition so for my own businesses I wanted that I didn't want to have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I didn't want to depend on ads to drive customers to my businesses I wanted to rank high in Google that's why I like SEO and that's why I use boring marketing.com and that's why I invested in it they're so confident in their approach that they offer a 30-day Sprint with 100% money back guarantee who does that nowadays so check it out highly recommend boring marketing.com so the next idea she has is a Blog and a newsletter in a box so help everyone set up their own avc.com so you don't know abc.com it's a blognews letter by Fred Wilson who's a VC in New York City he's been doing this for like at least 15 20 years um it's super super simple I think originally uh his blog was on Tumblr um not sure where it is today but yeah you know the idea around would someone you know does someone want to blog in a newsletter in a box I mean there is substack but it's you know substack feels very newsletter first I do think think that there's probably an opportunity to build something like this and and make it easy for for people like maybe there's just an maybe the idea is just like you're an agency and you work on top of all these different services and you just set it up for them you know you use existing services but I'm I'm not a big fan of like okay let's go and create the next substack but like make it more blog first because I think that's really hard and you're competing against people who've raised tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars so uh don't like that idea but uh do like the uh idea around you know we work with behive we work with substack we work with WordPress uh we charge a very small one-time fee to help you get set up for it and you probably do cold outbound to to get people to to do this this is like you know definitely a cold outbound cold email cold DM uh to get people and say like hey I noticed that you don't have uh a Blog setup I notice you don't have a newsletter you're missing out um I think you talk about you use a lot of social uh social credibility around you know soand so Lenny ritky didn't have a Blog and newsletter and now he's making $5 million a year with his blog and newslet um and he does it running on a you know n you know a free substack and you can do the same so I think you the way to do it is you do a mix of the cold cold DM and then you use your your content like how do you build an audience and you talk about these stories and then you you funnel them to a really cheap offer onetime offer why one time over monthly for something like this I just think that it's going to be a no-brainer for people this is a this is a business that uh you might be able to start on your side the starting costs are are quite small um so uh so cheers Danny for giving us this idea um all right let's talk about some ideas I don't really love so virtual workspace compete with tandem uh which is a tandem is a virtual let's check tandem real quick so I just checked out tandem I'm pretty sure tandem was like one of those apps that you can see other teammates in like a third space um and they've like seems like they they pivoted to more of like a slack plus video conferencing so it's hard you know to build what what Danny is you know suggesting is quite hard um you know a social app basically making slack more social um first of all you have to like build slack um so that's step one and then so you know Step One is building All The Primitives what people are used to and then step two is like okay now I got to figure out how can I make this different and and interesting in a social experience so this is this is one of those ideas where I think you know they call it a tarpit idea it's an idea that seems good on paper but like once you actually go and uh go into it it's actually a bad idea because there's so much investment that you need to put into something like this and then you have to get people off slack you have to get people off Microsoft team so um don't love this idea at all other idea whole world is a silent disco the problems with turntable FM is is it was too early turntable FM was was was an idea where people create these like virtual rooms and You' play music and you can like chat with other people who are in these virtual rooms and you had like your own avatar it almost felt like a game so she says now everyone is walking around listening to music every everywhere and someone is going to build the network DJ station where the whole world is one big silent disco I just think this is just a cool idea it's a really cool idea I hope someone does something like this I actually don't think it's that hard to do something like this um but getting people it's not hard to build the thing getting you know the whole world to get off their current platforms is hard and getting people to pay for it and dealing with the licenses in the music industry not so easy so uh cool idea hard to execute okay another technical idea jsfiddle meets Twitter so jsfiddle is basically you can write code online JavaScript pulls in different libraries and you can run it all online you don't need an it's not an ID or anything like that so uh it's very popular millions of people use it but when you look at it it's it's really focused just on Developers to compile their code it's not social at all and you're starting to see a common denominator with a lot of uh Danny's ideas to be like Technical and social and she ended up building something in that space jam. deev which is around bug TR tracking that's social and hundreds of thousands of people I think use it but there's an opportunity here uh to basically take JS fiddle and make it more like Twitter so it's half writing code and half meming and REM mixing I think that there's something here I think developers love memes they love remixing so I think the idea around compiling code and uh having a place where people can talk Meme and remix some of that software is very compelling the next idea Shopify for X I think Shopify is an80 billion company and when you have an $80 billion company there's just opportunities to unbundle it so what is Dany what's Danny's idea so she says Shopify for making an Airbnb stale Marketplace Shopify for making a messaging app Shopify for making an Instagram like app there are all these no code tools they're either too limited or too complex what you need is a product specific tool like Shopify is no code Ecommerce then you would also build no code marketplaces no code messaging app no code Instagram this is such a good idea this is such a good idea you know this idea around Marketplace for no code apps that if you listen to you know this idea on on this podcast or one of these ideas you can just like oh go to the marketplace duplicate the idea and then you know just pay let's say a monthly fee or onetime fee for a license to it I love that now I think bubble is doing pieces of that um so maybe you just build on top a bubble but uh something like this needs to exist should exist will exist so I think this is definitely the direction things are going okay next idea HQ trivia for dating live dating show mobile HQ style HQ trivia I think it was like 201819 literally everyone was playing in if you don't remember it it was this guy Steve rowski I think uh every single day you get a push notification and he would do live trivia and they'd give away money and millions of people played it daily it was an incredible experience and it ended up uh crashing and burning in a in a large part because of it was like a crazy story actually like the found this the founder uh unfortunately died and they had growing pains too and it was there were drugs involved it was just crazy so I don't think the the point is I don't think the reason why HQ trivia died is because the format didn't work and I think someone my prediction is someone's gonna bring back the HQ trivia format and apply it to a new Niche maybe it's dating and it's going to work in 2024 25 25 2026 so HQ dating you know I I think that live dating like this is interesting to so many people uh I love this idea and yeah you got to come up with a catchy name you got to make it interesting like I think you start in like a Los Angeles or New York like it has to feel almost like a

what do you mean by chasing generational wealth is overrated and wealth is underrated I'm not chasing generational wealth like I don't need hundreds of millions of dollars or billions of dollars this came to me uh a couple years ago we got offered $100 million blank check to basically scale out late checkout and build build out a bunch of new products faster acquire faster just take our model and just add steroid to it and we turned it down and the VC basically called me up like sweating bullets he [Music] goes people need a sip on Jonathan jce cream Courtney yeah I'm going to just start calling myself Jay ice cream now on your podcast I like calling you jaice cream yeah that's not what I intended when I uh created my gamer tag but you can call me whatever you like greig the internet bro that's the Internet it's your podcast dude what do you want to talk about today I've got three options for you and I'm going to tell you them in order of what I think I would be most interested in number one and also this straight up I think would just work well for views and engagement and all that good YouTube stuff number one I've got a pile of books next to me and [Music] and these are the books that had the biggest effect on me getting to my first million uh running my business so I thought a conversation around which books were actually influential not just inspiring but also had practical sort of uh outcomes and measurable outcomes so I thought that that could be an episode so it's like the books that made us our first million or some [ __ ] all right um the second idea I had was on your Twitter and this is sort of in a similar Vein on your Twitter you posted 50 like 50 life hacks for you today no 50 life hacks for you in today's stressful competitive world and you had 50 life hacks I thought we could go through those see where we get to I think each of them is really interesting I think that could be really useful so both of those are more on the entrepreneurial Journey finding an advantage as an entrepreneur Vibe and then the third thing is just like I have an idea for a startup okay let's start with the IDE let's go backwards we're going to start with the idea then we're going to go the life hacks and then we're going to go the books that if we get to it no yeah if well it's gonna be seven hour episode listen to the whole episode to to get to it we are going to get to it we'll only get to it if you like and comment right now and know we'll know it's the least you can do it's the least you could do after all we've done after all we've been through together all after yeah I mean we're not it's not like we're someone's paying us to make these videos I mean I'm certainly not getting paid anyway I'm waiting on that check um so yeah please all we ask for is a like and a a positive comment about my hair and um so before the episode started I asked uh Greg how how the comments were and he said some people didn't like your hair and I was like okay I'm going to go look for those comments now um so we need more we need more positive hair comments so I got a big haircut in two episodes ago it was a big haircut uh so we'll need a we'll need some updates on that okay so I'll we'll go with some startup ideas I'm going to hit you with one and I'm gonna I'm GNA be honest with you that actually this idea came from ammer who works at AJ and smart um we were chatting around lunch and I was like I'm going on Greg's p and you know he loves ideas he's he loves all these ideas he kind of like stopped talking and just went fully quiet and just stared into space and then he came up with this great idea well I like it anyway and his idea is a product called drip right and the the idea behind this product it's kind of like a you know how you I don't know if you use Twitter like this or if you use the internet like this I have like tons of bookmarks tons of screenshots tons of things where I'm like oh my God that's a cool quote that's a cool thing I want to check this out later um and also I use like Pocket Cast to put articles into just collecting loads of stuff but in the end the truth is I very rarely go back to any of it and I think that's really Common People rarely go back to any of this readit later stuff even the like best possible readit later software it still acts as a bit of like a hole for all of stuff it's just like a big black box um and ammer had this idea which I thought was pretty cool for a product that well he he said all of these services are basically procrastination machines like screenshotting bookmarking save later you rarely go back and take action on these things and he had an idea for an AI startup which I thought was pretty cool and the idea is the product itself combines your sources let's say just you could even just start with bookmarks on Twitter on X um and pocket C uh the using pocket cast the things you've actually saved so you don't even have to create a new plugin for it and instead of it just being a massive pile of stuff that you go to you get things drip fed to you at a pace that you feel like and this could be something as simple as SMS so once a day you wake up and it's like combining maybe three or four things that have something similar since synthesizing them together and saying and giving you that idea so an example of that could be you wake up in the morning you look at your text there's a lot of weird ones you know like a lot of a lot of weird [ __ ] like I don't know just I wish that person would stop texting me but anyway next to that you have drip right and drip is an AI That's dressed up in cool drip right it's just got it's it's very viby and you open it up and it's like essentially it's your thought for the day or your thing for the day or your idea for the day or it could even just be your inspiration for the day and it's taking the topic is around one topic that I got really into a couple of months ago was this idea of atomization I don't know if you ever read this article called the atomization of life I think the guy is called nat Alias anyway I saved that article and then I Googled it and I saved loads of other things and then I bookmarked loads of stuff and the idea would be one day just it could be a year later it's just like quick ad break let me tell you about a business I invested in it's called boring marketing.com so a few years ago I met this group of people that were some of the best SEO experts in the world they were behind getting some of the biggest companies found on Google and the secret sauce is they've got a set of technology and AI that could help you out rank your competition so for my own businesses I wanted that I didn't want to have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I didn't want to depend on ads to drive customers to my businesses I wanted to rank high in Google that's why I like SEO and that's why I use boring marketing.com and that's why I invested in it they're so confident in their approach that they offer a 30-day Sprint with 100% money back guarantee who does that nowadays so check it out highly recommend boring marketing.com this you know a couple of months ago you were researching atomization here's a couple of new things that have come up around this topic here's a some of the quotes that you highlighted here are a couple of things you were interested in and it's just a little one pager or just a text message and that's literally it you can either go down the rabbit hole back into that topic or nothing it's just reminding you of interesting things you've collected and there's no Central interface where you go and see all the stuff so you don't have another dump to go to to see where all your articles that you're not reading are stored and over time maybe it can get smarter and smarter and like I don't want to make it unrealistic because if you're talking about like a oneperson startup you're not going to be it's not going to be able to tell which parts of podcasts you listen to etc etc but you could go further but the initial idea is a fairly cheap service that drip feeds you back information that you've stored for yourself at a pace that you wanted to drip feed it to you and it's called drip AI drip a drip it's a little idea someone should do it would be really cool if you can also connect the dots so for me I I'm like one of I'm one of those people too like I I have like thousands of bookmarks and I bookmark them I'm like in my mind I'm like I'm going to get back to this yeah I'm totally getting back to this never get back to it in fact on my newsletter I started just sending out five bookmarks uh on my call Gregs letter Greg Eisenberg dcom and I started doing that because I literally don't look at my bookmarks and I was like this is going to force me like creating a newsletter around these five most interesting bookmarks of the week is going to force me to drill in my head that these bookmarks I need to like read them write notes and but then I forget about them so yes absolutely I forget about what if you could What If instead of drilling into your head you could drip out of your head that's what I'm saying that's what I'm saying you know the drip noise that's what saying I think it would be cool because I think a lot of people there I don't know why everyone loves to make bookmarks uh products like collect all your bookmarks collect all your stuff I'm like I'm clicking the things in the apps that store this [ __ ] for me my problem isn't collecting my problem is getting it brought back to me you know that's what's actually my issue yeah I think the the easy way to do this so it you know you can still be a oneman startup and build this and not have to do crazy AI stuff build a big team and raise Venture is when you sign up to the service it could say what are your goals and what kind of business are you in so you know for example I could say I'm an agency owner and I'm trying to get to 75 million this year in revenue and I'm looking for Content that XYZ and then from those data points from that first- party data from the data of the bookmarks then it's like oh hey we're going to like resurface this bookmark with this like you know new piece of information that wpp has like acquired this agency yes and we think Community notes Edition or something yeah I would just start if I was starting this tomorrow and I just wanted to make like 99 cents per person per month or something I would just focus purely on X my target marketer entrepreneurs or creatives who like and bookmark crap tons of stuff on X and would just simply build something that collects that and sends it back to them like it doesn't even it can be more like a boomerang thing it's like just it always it always chooses thing it kind of chooses things from a year ago one day two weeks ago another day and in the beginning it would be a little bit random just to see if people care about the idea of reminiscing and bringing these things back and then maybe adding on this context thing like there's been an update to this or this tweet this person who tweeted this thing has talked more about it again and here's that um so I think there's there's a very simple basic baby version of this which could be free and maybe with ads or something and then there's like the AI powered version of it which adds context and synthesizes I I don't think I I I do a free version like to me it's you do a paid version I think uh the way to get a lot of people excited about this is you create a bunch of Twitter accounts that are like Shan pu's bookmarks Greg eisenberg's bookmarks J ice creams bookmarks and maybe what you do is you go to some of these creators and you're like hey I'll give you $1,000 a month if you just like share share your bookmarks with me I think that's pretty cool that could even be we take a couple of steps back that's another product now where you could just have that as an email list true oh my Greg Eisenberg Shan Puri and someone else's like it's basically the entrepreneur secret bookmarks paid Weekly Newsletter it's just here's what other people are liking and interested in that would be I would definitely pay for that how much would you pay for it um I'm probably not the right person to ask because I would probably pay a lot because I you I just spoke to you before this podcast about how much I'm about to pay for a mentor um but I would I mean I would minimum pay like $10 a month or something by the way I thought you were going to say like yeah minimum pay like10 to $50,000 a month were like $10 a month I don't know uh you know you think you're a baller you think you're a baller because you're about to spend $10 a month on this service I do 10 I do 10 no I just mean like I'm I'm already sold on being able to access things like that like I think if we're trying to do like a large target market but then again I mean if we're thinking about people who are entrepreneurs who are like maybe a couple of million behind those people whose bookmarks you get to look at that could be pretty interesting but yeah I would I don't know I never know what I would pay for something until someone sells it to me totally you know what I mean totally but I think there's two ideas here and they're all around bookmarks people don't need another bookmarking app people no no don't do it bookmarks do you use any of these things like pocketcasts and stuff no I use Twitter bookmarks religiously and that's it but there you go okay so book people who use Twitter bookmarks a product for them that's a beautiful Niche a people entrepreneurs who use Twitter bookmarks very often and obviously never look at them again uh come on that's a great Niche all right come on come on why aren't you more excited yeah why aren't you more excited why isn't someone building this right now it's such a great idea again the drip aspect of this is from ammer at AJ and smart I want to give him all the credit ammer you're a legend ammer Khalifa on X I just want I just don't want to take the credit because he gave me that idea yeah but we took in our defense we took the idea to the next level yeah exactly we took the the seed yeah the seed was was B SE spread the seed the seed was H what does it what happens when a chicken seed was laid why is it laid like an egg I don't know I saw it happen with my own eyes though he's a weird guy you know then I sat on it and incubated it for a few hours and then I brought it to you and we hatched it yes and then we fried it and it was amazing you are lovely thank you we consumed it yeah we don't talk about eggs enough on this podcast we don't and then everyone who's listening to it sipped it and they sipped the egg juice you know when I'm looking back on episodes of this podcast and I'm thinking thinking a lot of people you know there's no we're going back to the egg juice you can't just say and they sip the egg juice and just like segue it into something else sip the egg juice that's my next idea egg juice but I was I was going to make a point related like when I come when I come to this podcast so obviously I I've been on a couple of episodes of this podcast and I'm sort of like a an an an anomaly in it like as as in I'm I'm regularly here but when I look at the comments I'm like oh yeah people don't realize that my brain is a bit broken and that I'm just kind of also a silly man I'm a silly man and when people come here for like hardcore backtack business ideas and I'm on here like there was there was some guy in your in your comments last week um who was like uh I want to give you some constructive feedback great yeah I saw that one don't have this guy on your podcast anymore and what did I do what did you do I actually didn't check the follow I I texted you and I was like hey you want to record a pod right now hell yeah I would like to give you some constructive feedback Greg this guy sucks is that what he said no it was like I'd like to give you some constructive feedback uh something like I don't like listening to this guy and doesn't bring value and he just Rambles and I'm like this I mean true the reality of the situation is that startup idea with the Insight around bookmarks is a huge Insight now he should give constructive feedback on how huge of an Insight it is I like period that's a that's a really good Insight no and it's something I'm gonna think about so yeah listen you might talk about egg juice here and there and that's really really strange and unusual and I I hope you're well but I'm not well but you know in a sea of egg juice you you sprinkle on some great startup ideas and some good insights that I think people should be taking notes uh and I I take notes so that's why I bring you on all right yeah thank you Matt all right see you I'm going to bed next uh next segment you wanted to talk about life hacks okay look you did this post right I bookmarked it yeah you did Greg I bookmarked the [ __ ] out of it um I Su your team has to I'll try to reduce the swearing because I know they have to beep it out okay so let's I'm gonna I'm you did this post on Twitter your team can maybe bring it up on screen it's 50 life hacks I'm going to just go to a few of them and ask you to expand on it uh or to talk about them and or just very heavily agree with them maybe I'll just choose the top 10 of your 50 life hacks does that sound good well let's do that but be sure to bring up the one around Instagram close friends okay I'm gonna do that first first thing and it's really the first one use social media apps on desktop only so that you don't get sucked in I mean so [ __ ] like do you basically then have no social media apps on your phone I the only social media app I have on my phone is Tik Tok oh and that sounds like an addictive one though and it's like buried away and it isn't something that I post on and it for me it's not an addictive one so I think I mean I think the advice is don't have the you know certain apps are more addictive to to certain people like Twitter for me would be the most addictive Instagram to others would be the most addictive so I just remove the ones that are addictive to me and uh it's just the experience on desktop isn't as dopamine friendly yeah than on mobile you got to be crazy to put social media apps on your phone just you got to be crazy period I agree do you um do you sometimes though sneakily log into X on your Safari browser no actually I don't you don't no but sometimes I will say if I'm out of the house for like a really long time or I'm traveling or something and I've got like a a tweet or something that I just can't get out of my head I'll Banger a banger as as say I'll I'll download it and and you know quickly push push a live and then delete it after okay you'll you'll delete it yeah I I deleted social media on my phone years ago but I'll occasionally get sucked into you know it's your fault that I'm back on X I wasn't I was off X for like four or five years before I did the first one of these podcasts and then you were screenshotting what people were saying about it and I was like I'll just log in and now I'm so addictive it's so good um but yeah I also don't put these on my phone and again I try to use this brick like this brick thing that I talked about a couple of episodes to to block things okay use analogies people remember them can you give me an example of what you're talking about there in analogy format I tweeted this uh and someone who listens to the Pod was like yeah and the river goes into the river into steps into the river remember from episodes ago the worst analogy ever yeah I made like the worst analogy ever yeah so I read a book a long time ago and maybe this is actually interesting because we're going to talk about books later but it was called made to stick I love that book you remember that book I remember it and I love it and I actually refer to it a lot in my training when I'm training people in facilitation so I read it maybe 15 years ago at this point and and it talked a lot about how do you communicate in a way that sticks with people and one of the ways is just analogies like the reality is when you have a conversation with someone for an hour they're going to remember one or two things that you were covered in egg juice and the smell of it even egg juice right it's so visual you can like kind of picture it I can picture it it it's oh yeah you certain you can smell it unfortunately MH smell it right now so analogies work and in in the context of business specifically like creating content selling people analogies just really stick in people's minds absolutely um especially if you're I I think one of the best analogy formats because I remember so made to stick is an amazing book uh it also talks about this concept of the curse of knowledge which is amazing the idea is that once you know a topic you now can't like you can't act as if you don't know it anymore you can't imagine what it's like to be a person who doesn't know this thing anymore and so you actually get worse at explaining something the more you know it so when I'm trying to sell uh facilitation training and I've been a facilitator and a designer for 14 years I have to remember this curse of knowledge thing and bring myself right back to the basics and analogies are an amazing way to bring things back to the basics and there's this like uh format that I saw Russell Brunson use to make things into more of an analogy and it's like he uses the you know how or it's like yeah it's the the simple format he has is the it's kind of like or it's kind of like when so sometimes it's like you're you're thinking about okay how do I explain something like facilitation to people well it's kind of when you're on a trip with your friends and nobody's in charge of how we're going to get from the airport to the hotel and it just feels super chaotic and everyone's kind of bickering at each other well imagine if you had if one of the people in the group just said I'm going to take care of Transportation it's kind of like that it's kind of like and this is something we actually use in our ads is this analogy is the being on being on vacation with your friends supposed to be something nice but it gets really frustrating when everyone needs to decide where to go for dinner and imagine if there was someone who was taking the lead so that it's kind of like thing when you're making copy when you're writing copy when you're writing an ad just keeping this written somewhere in front of you it's kind of like and then something relatable so anything you're trying to sell or anything you're trying to talk about you got to remember that it's kind of like and something relatable something I've learned from analogy creating the other the other thing related to this that some of the the smartest entrepreneurs I know do is they make it conversational when they're writing copy or they're communicating so what they'll do is instead of saying I remember a story that Steve Jobs said and he and just like explaining what the story is you say you know when Steve Jobs was at WWDC and you know everyone thought that you know Blackberry owned mobile Steve Jobs goes up on stage he goes so using the words he goes and then you just talk like you are Steve Jobs when you're conversational and you talk like the person that you're bringing up it puts the person listening a gives them a front row seat and it is just a way more effective way to get your point across 100% agree with that have you ever had Neville madora on your podcast no I don't know him but you need to get him on your podcast I I I do need to get him on the podcast he has a book called this book will teach you to write better uh it takes 15 minutes to read it's like an Amazon printed book and it goes into a lot of these topics about how to tell stories from other people's perspectives but he has one statement in there when it comes to copy when it comes to all of this thing we're talking about and he said when you're writing when you're writing for and he goes and he goes and yeah and he goes did I actually say that he he said he said oh yeah okay and he goes and I'll just do his accent and fully no and he goes when you're thinking about writing for people the one thing you have to have locked into your head is nobody cares about you they only care about themselves and this is one of the key this this Insight that I got when I read that book really locked in for me to the point that whenever I'm writing copy or whenever I'm talking to my team about copy I'm like I'm like and I go are we writing here about and about how great we are or are we talking about what they're going to get so this is something that just like super locks into my brain the funniest part of what you just said was that you tried to do Neville madora accent but then you just used your own accent oh no I was thinking like if you're going to really embody the person and I try to do a big Austin accent and if I was trying to do the Steve Jobs California accent and getting like like if I overthought if I if I really Inc correctly took your advice and I thought you meant full impersonation yeah like you start talking about Steve Jobs and then you're like oh give me a second and you like pull up a black turtleneck and you just start changing yeah change for 15 minute change yeah and then like practicing for ages and then the person's gone all right move on this one I really want to know what you think about this because or I really want to know the exact thing you do you said you should show up to meetings with small gifts the ROI is insane um I have a lot of meetings coming up uh what with especially with people who are a lot more important than me I would say they are more important than me but like they're more successful than me what kind of gift I'm always wondering what to do like tell talk about this tell me what you do so when I first moved to San Francisco I became friends with a group of 10 Japanese people who had just just moved to San Francisco too and they all could barely speak English really was they were learning about American culture and stuff like that and one of the first things I noticed was every time I'd meet them they would show up with a gift and although I didn't need a pancake mix as a gift which was one of the gifts it didn't need stuff like that it was just so nice that they showed up with a gift so I took that to heart and and when I was in my early 20s I remember I bought a thousand mini budas because who doesn't want luck of a of a of a mini [Laughter] Buddha okay so a thousand mini buddas and you gave them all to one person right yeah yeah no I gave so I I spent I gave out those it was like the year of the Buddha I gave out all a thousand Buddhas that year [ __ ] hell yeah had a lot of meetings in in my early 20s I would just like meet with anyone yeah and people just like started talking about it it's definitely memorable yeah people people started talking about it and I like kind of became known as like the guy who showed up with gifts from that and and by the way I was giving gifts to like the founder of uber who I just like randomly met and all these crazy people that I shouldn't have been in those rooms but I was in those rooms and they would send me an email right after and be like by the way thanks I I'm I'm looking at the right now that's pretty cool so it works especially if you're trying to build your network and you're trying to create a lasting impression in people's minds it also puts you in a a humble position I would say like I don't know if this is even remotely the intention but it shows somehow some respect to the other person I feel I think so what do you do today like okay I am going to meet some people over the next few weeks and I want to bring them gifts but what what kind of things I'm always kind of struggling between like what's too expensive and desperate seeming and what's like too stupid like what what do you think I could bring it like price doesn't matter it's really just the thoughtfulness yeah you know I don't know if a thousand Buddhas would make sense today maybe they would but it's just thinking about you know know maybe today people are really stressed about the election let's say mhm um and it's generating anxiety so what is something that you can give to people that is the is the anti of that what is something small thoughtful that you can give Xanax yeah you know maybe you should just go to become a Pharma company does costex I don't I don't know okay I get your idea though so like a nice T yeah well the problem with te is that you're you're done right like I'm sure that there's people who still have these little budas on their desks teot teapot is a good one so it should be permanent like something that stays what about okay if I was meeting you I don't know if I'm going to be able to pull this off before my next meeting but if I was meeting you and I got I got you the play date this little cute yellow console from the guys at Panic would you think that's cute I would think that's really I would love that like that would make me so happy but that's not permanent I don't think a yellow a little yellow actually yeah it's pretty permanent I take it back it's pretty permanent I actually just annoyingly realized that that's a great gift for people right now and I don't know if I'm be a going to be able to get it on time [ __ ] I was going to get people these the little tp7 but they're really hard to buy would you like a gift yeah it's but it's really it's something we all we forget like I don't know it it's actually really good intangible thing to do I feel like it's something that not a lot of people do and I I think also there's something about coming across as I don't know how to put this when I meet okay just tell me if this makes sense the way I'm going to put it you I I often meet people who are a lot more successful than me and after a while you sort of become friends with them and I feel like what other people do that I that other people do wrong is that let let's say I'm become friends with someone who's like uh who's been running a company for 25 years super successful I'm years away from ever getting there and I may never get there and they clearly have all the connections I would want all of the things we talked about this canvas strategy idea and I'm here and eventually I become friends with them I think what a lot of people do wrong is they're like oh now I'm friend so now I'm just going to get all this person's contacts and I'm just going to call them whatever I feel like etc etc whereas I would always in my mind think okay so like this person is still being very gracious to give me their time even though we're friends Etc and so I think giving a gift and would would you give gifts every time you meet someone like or just the first time basically how many gifts am I going to get is one I'm trying to figure out the best time to give a gift is to give a gift when the person least expects it so when they're in the toilet kick down the door here you go here's a play date oh no Jay cream's here play it how did you get my address 1,000 buddas put their kid to bed I'm hanging off the ceiling with 1,000 budhas holding them in a box and shaking sweating what are you spraying at me why are you spraying egg juice at me yeah one of them Falls in their head and they're like you know like it's like a horror movie the camera kind of pans up and I'm there like strapped to the ceiling like what I mean by that is sorry on people's birthdays they often get gifts yeah and they're busy yes they're Pro they're are they more likely or less likely to remember a gift you give them on their on their birthday less likely exactly so you want to you want to give someone a gift when they're not expecting it so that could mean the first time you meet them but then also like at month 6 or month 18 or month 24 so it's not just about every time you meet them in person yeah yeah don't be like a bot it's not like a system you don't create like a system where it's like okay on the third week of every you know month I buy this thing and I create a script no like be a human being you know what I think a great book uh great I ruined it I think a great um gift what I give to people is this book I mean having a book that you gift to people um why I think this is a nice gift this one hell yeah Hornell hell yeah or no by dere ders it's one of my favorite books of all time by the way yeah I can't believe you're going into books even though no no no but this is this is one that I gift people I give it as a gift um so I bought I buy it in bulk off the website and then you can get like this hard cover version the one you get on Amazon sucks it's like a soft cover kind of like crappy looking one but you can get the nice hard cover editions from the website I buy like 20 of them and I give them as gifts to people when they come to my apartment I give it to them as a gift so that's kind of like something I do that's cool um so that's just an example of that's a really good one is always have gifts in your apartment or house yeah to give to people like no if anyone wants this when they come over to my place it's like a glasses cleaner but it's covered in other strange stains I wasn't trying to bring the book thing in all right wait let's do another okay let's let's go back to this uh hack hack list okay keep a learning list make learning your side hustle what do you think about that I mean I wrote it so what do you mean by what do you mean by like a learning list like courses you want to do books you want to read I have I use the things to-do list app oh you Ed things I think it was it's made in Germany I think somewhere it's made somewhere think it's Germany it's somewhere in Europe for sure I think it's Germany I'm just trying to get a claim to Fain here an American using a tech product that's made in Germany is like a big deal you know we don't tend to make much stuff over here yeah it's made in Germany okay yeah I I use this German product called thing yeah there we go that's right that's right cultured code GHA if you're listening to this episode you guys make a lovely product I think it's a really lovely product it's a lovely product I use it I have one of my tasks on it is learning list and every quarter I have three new things that I'm trying to learn oh okay I don't do that um it's basically every month I'm trying to learn a new thing and the thing I'm trying to learn sometimes it's about business but sometimes it's just like a personal thing so it could be well actually right now I'm I'm taking a bunch of Stanford online courses on finance oh interesting so I never went to Business School uh of course I can like read an income statement a balance sheet that sort of thing but you know there's I figured hey it would be great to be better at this so it's one of those things where if you don't put it in a list and and actually like have homework and put in your calendar you're never going to get around to it how do you decide what you want to learn is it just like following your interests or is it related to like business weaknesses you have or life weaknesses I think it's business weaknesses and and life's Curiosities so like right now I'm also like for this upcoming three months I'm also just trying to get better at Guitar so taking a guitar course and then if I pull up I'm also learning how to golf oh interesting yeah it's probably a good way to network with high net worth people as well is golfing it's also I live in Florida so you know it's a golfing place it's a golfing plays mhm what do you mean by chasing generational wealth is overrated and wealth is underrated this came to me uh a couple years ago we got offered $100 million blank check to build to basically scale out late checkout and build build out a bunch of new products faster acquire faster just take our model and just add steroids to it and we turned it down and the VC basically called me up like sweating bullets he goes he go he goes go this is a Blackberry he goes I don't understand this is like a Surefire way for you and your team to get generational wealth yeah he has a similar voice to you actually yeah similar voice very similar voice to me and I go I'm not I'm not chasing generational wealth like I don't need hundreds of millions of dollars or billions of dollars in fact when I you know the people who I look up to who have that sort of wealth they they give away 99.9% of their wealth anyways to Charities what I'm about is I want to I I want to live a wealthy life I want to live a rich life I want to be able to do whatever it is I want but I don't need generational wealth I think that's it's something that what I don't like about chasing General generational wealth is it's infinite you're chasing an infinite goal I have I have zero interest in generational wealth either maybe I maybe it's just because I don't think I can actually make it maybe if I had a no but really I I also like I guess this die with zero concept where you use the money and when you die like I was thinking about it like my daughter doesn't need to have crap tons of money from me uh when she's older because I didn't have that and I I found it really fun to figure out how to make money I worked in bars I worked in restaurants then I started my own things then I you know like that that gave me sort of like something to do and sort of like a purpose um so yeah I I I would definitely agree with you how how would you define normal wealth though like how do you define that for yourself I'm currently working with like a financial adviser to figure out for me like what is it that I actually should earn I run like a creative thing and so it it's variable based on my vibes so like how do I how do you and me figure that kind of thing out that's so frustrating to the financial adviser they're like so what's your goal and and you go that's literally just based on my vibes he literally really nice guy Sebastian I um can definitely recommend him if you're in Germany uh reach out to me and I'll connect you he he asked me what my goal was and I was like first of all he was sitting in the AJ and smart office which looks like K like just looks like an art museum or some sort like a chaotic Art Museum and I'm like look around like do you think I have goals my goal is to keep making stuff that I want to do I want to just do stuff that I enjoy but yeah I don't have any goals at all I don't know what I want to do I mean financially yeah do you have like a number or like just keeps going up I don't have a number because people I know who have numbers are just they hit the number and then the number becomes 2X and then they hit the number and the number becomes 2X and they hit the number and becomes twox yeah the way I think about it is I want to be able to do what I want yes you don't want anyone to tell you what to do where to be yeah yeah and there's a lifestyle that I I want to have and that requires like a certain amount of money but that's kind of where I'm at all right next life that connects to that connects to number 20 which is craft a personal mission statement to guide your decisions first of all do you want to share your one and second of all how how do I do that well what's your personal mission statement I don't have one you don't have one even around like facilitator decom and my personal mission statement is I want to follow my interests and then make stuff that make interest make things that I find interesting with other people I don't like to make stuff just by myself and ideally other people like using those things I don't that's that I don't have a mission statement but if it would be something like that make make interesting stuff yeah that I find interesting it's very much about around making things I like to create stuff I like making things so where this came from was a lot of companies have mission statements most companies have mission statements and I realized that found ERS because they they care so much about making the business work they kind of lose sight of what what their goals are I have recently very much lost sight of my goals of which I've never defined but I can sense it yeah so that's my point on this life hack like it doesn't make differ how do doesn't make a difference what your mission is or what mine is it's just like have a mission but how what does one look like can you like tell me what that statement sounds like I literally don't know what you mean yeah so help me help me help you help me a personal mission statement could be something like it could be numbers like you can say I want to make a million dollars a year and I want my children to have the best possible life and I want to have a happy family and that's a personal mission statement you have you know could be you can put dollars in there it could be you can add personal of course into it family friends so you OB you don't want to share yours basically I don't want to share mine it's personal personal share it with us great okay guys if you like and comment share it with us Greg then in the next episode Greg will share his personal mission statement No but it's interesting a lot of um a lot of Americans say things like you know uh that's sort of like my purpose or my mission it's very rare to hear people outside of the US saying these sentences um and so yeah it's interesting for me just sort of trying to understand it and trying to see if that makes sense for me um I like the idea of having like so what I have is a Post-It in my kitchen which says 2024 do you want actually would can I go get it just to show you or is that an annoying thing for me to do right now go for it yeah all right just because it's so it's so like not a mission but it's like I I'll just I'll be back I'm not wearing any underwear pants so I'm just so at the end of 20123 I think it was the 29th of December my girlfriend and I did like a it's this Tim Ferris thing it's called the end of year review something like that and then we created our goals for next year based on how that works it's kind of embarrassing to show this because it's not like a public thing that I've ever showed but just to show you I think maybe my version of what we're talking about which is very much within the year so it looks like this um and so it's like three three questions for myself and then like one physical activity that I'm just going to lock into yeah it sounds like a weird thing um the questions are number one am I optimizing for state and that just means my state of mind like am I optimizing am I living my life in a way that's going to optimize for how I'm feeling because when I feel good and when I feel excited everything else works better uh really simple example of that is being very very cautious of things like alcohol uh not sleeping uh over caffeinating I I have my own like list of things that cause my state to turn back also social media um am I lowering noise and complexity so this is something where just thinking about like um you know you and I talked about this a couple of weeks ago as well I actually shut down my holding company after realizing that even though it makes sense from a financial perspective the noise and complexity even though it wouldn't for example be a problem for you for me that overwhelms me massively so am I lowering noise and complex and then the last one is kind of interesting am I being radically integral I don't I don't even know what that means yeah I know it's fine it's also a bit pretentious again I wasn't planning on showing this so it was only for me the idea there is that am I being first of all am I telling the truth like if someone asks me something like how am I feeling am I just telling them the answer to the question but also um am I basically living a way that that actually reflects what's happening in my head or am I just living in a way that's good for others to get what they want um being integral like having Integrity the idea is just like yeah am I being integral do I have integrity am I am I are the things I'm thinking similar are the things I'm thinking the same as the things I'm saying the same as the things I'm doing those three things lining up and uh then yoga I actually have done one hour of yoga per week since January um because I was having some back pains uh so that that also worked out well that's kind of more like an optimizing for State thing so yeah I don't have a mission statement but I I kind of break it down into like the three things I want to focus on for the year um but the mission statement think is pretty interesting do you have any is there any like thing I can watch or read about how to create a mission statement for myself yeah there's like uh there's like a few Frameworks for it I think it's there's one called the three question framework I'm so it's what is Mo what is most important to you what are your goals and what Val what values guide your actions so for example the integral piece that you talked about the the value that you have is integrity so then so you have pieces of it that's one framework there's also the purpose values goals framework so it's uh purpose what is your life about values what do you stand for and goals what do you want to achieve so I kind of like that one cuz I do think that you need to have some number what you know Associated like from a goal perspective because otherwise it just becomes like so lofty and then the last one uh that I've seen is the the five-step plan so it's uh what are your past successes identify themes from your past achievements what are your core values list list and prioritize your most important values identify contributions how you want to impact different areas of your life identify goals short and long-term goals and then it's write mission and vision statements so you're basically synthesizing all the above stuff in concise statements love it I'm going to look at all of those after I have them open as tabs I have them tabbed out tabbed out okay one one more one last pack one last and then and then more or then end of episode no then we could then three to four books okay I just want to talk quickly about the Instagram close friends one just because it's on my mind yeah say the Instagram close friends one I don't see it here did I not put that on the list oh yeah being on someone's IG close friends doesn't mean you're close friends so I don't know if this is just me but recently I met like a couple people out in the world and they just like throw me on close friends yeah it's like oh really Homie we just met I don't use I haven't used that feature in quite a while so I can't say much to this thing so so you so you telling the public just to not add you to close friends I'm saying that if someone just if someone adds you to close friends it doesn't mean they're your close friends and it you know if you want to get deeper it's it's like you only have a couple close friends in real life um I think that's also interesting because what you could do is if someone asks uh adds you to the close friends thing and then you see that they're doing something like a wedding or a family party and you haven't been invited you could get really irritated with them like oh thanks for the invite thought I was a close friend yeah I thought I was a very close friend and I didn't get put on your will interest so yeah okay fair enough that's a good one uh okay let me can I choose one more just to end on one that I like um okay avoid angry people they suck the good energy out of the room it's it sounds like really obvious and I would say not just angry or maybe you I don't know if you agree with this but I would say you also generally want to avoid people who are super cynical super pissed about everything it's like you meet someone and they're like oh did you hear about this stupid thing this stupid politician did this country's [ __ ] and you're like oh man I was having a good day and now I have to listen to this stuff um when when you say angry people are you saying someone who's just got a generally negative vibe or someone who's actually angry so in my mind I wasn't going to use this word on Twitter cuz it wouldn't hit the same but I think of them as kagin kinist the the people people who are not gonna hand out candy at Halloween because like they hate they hate the kids or the kids listen to loud rock music or whatever it is you know what I mean like also the people that just are rooting for you to lose they're also the people that if you come to them let me tell let me see if I can get this down to the perfect crystallization if if this is exactly what it is for you you're really excited about something you're really excited about a new thing let's say you got this and you're super excited and you show it to your friend and they're like H I heard teenage engineering are actually a [ __ ] company ohh that's like a waste of money that's crap like no matter what you do they like see that you're excited and they're like let me just take the pin out of that excit let me bring you down a few pegs just to make sure you're not too excited and too happy about stuff a lot of people hate this podcast for that reason actually because it's like positive vibes there's a group of people who love this podcast thank you for listening but there's I I noticed on Twitter there there's another group of people who are like oh the startup ideas podcast ideas that's nothing execution that's everything and like they hate on idea people and they don't realize that this is like a positive fun creative way to get people's juices flowing like that's what this is and those people that are just anti this podcast to me are like kudin and I think that when you're building a startup you want to you you can't have kudin in your life because it'll it's so hard as it is this is you know you've probably being given this advice or you've read it before that to succeed you need to be surrounded by people I I've heard this before and I took I unfortunately took the wrong lesson from it um when I was growing AJ and smart in the beginning one of my mentors was like you need to be surrounded by people who who will question everything who are like the devil's Advocates who are like the Ying to your yang and I was like oh yeah you're right you got to have you got to have those people around you um and what I realized is that maybe you want to have those types of people around you when you've already massively nailed it and you need to have let's say you're running Facebook you maybe need to have people around you who are like oh let's hold the brakes let's make sure this decision doesn't have like crazy consequences down the road but generally you're mostly you mostly don't want to be surrounded by people who are questioning everything and being the devil Devil's Advocates and telling you all the ways things can go wrong when your business is just starting out you're still under 20 million you want to be surrounded by people who are enthusiastic Advocates and who are excited about what you're doing and I think there was a time at AJ and smart where I really brought a lot of people up to the top of the business who kind of opposed everything I did because I thought that that's what you're supposed to do and so it's like and and in the end what happens is the founder or the person running the company just loses Steam and gets less excited and the whole thing just kind of falls apart and so yeah I think as long as you're especially when you're like the company relies on your energy and you being excited and you being positive kagin are the ultimate like Kryptonite for a Founder The problem is they are everywhere and the other thing the best quote I've ever read on this is pessimists will always be right but optimists will always get wealthy something like that something around those uh around that's what it was you don't have that's what it was yeah that right and I think that's that's such an amazing sentence to have in mind if you're building a business or if you're running a podcast or if I'm even as a guest on this podcast I'm going to get kerin in the comments telling me that I ramble too much or that I look stupid or that whatever [ __ ] y'all you know I need the positive energy to even keep going you're not on this podcast you're not out here running the startup ideas podcast like Greg is and putting all the effort into it you're just sitting around complaining online and I think that energy isn't you're 100% right like that energy is not what you want to have around you and then people will say to you Greg which you've probably gotten if you would do that as a post on its own on Twitter people would say to you oh yeah sure just surround surround yourself with people who just like you know Brown NOS you all day or whatever and that's not the point the point is you're not at the point yet where you need people to pick things apart you're not at the point yet you still momentum is still important to you and so enthusiasm and being enthusiastic being excited is super important oh [ __ ] I just that's how excited you were I got I got too excited I got too excited you know it's the enthusiasm and excitement of a founder of a small business or or a startup is so unbelievably important like it's not it's one of the things that brings down startups and and small businesses most often is the founders just giving up and burning out that's it it's that and running out of cash yeah but they run out of cash also because they just run out of energy for it often true or they ALS you know something bad happens open AI changes their you know their price don't be a Comm don't be a kudon dude don't question anything I say no right I think this is uh RAM sham who was on the board of Google OG GE he's wrong OG Silicon Valley guy he was on uh the board of a company I was at a few companies ago that I was helping run and he was he's the one who told me he was like there's two ways that a company dies either the team gives up or the company runs out of cash yeah and I think number one the team team gives up usually means the leader leaders give up um and just run out of energy and run out of steam and just can't be bothered with the like you see that often with content creators as well like when they get bullied offline or something it's just a matter of whether they are going to stick around or not and it's it's really often like that with especially small businesses when AJ and smart when this business that I run when it's doing its best is when I'm excited and enthusiastic and then I can make my team excited and enthusiastic because I'm the cheerleader at the company but when I give myself like a you know if I surround myself with people who are just telling me everything's wrong and everything sucks then I also can't cheerlead myself or my team I think it's huge one if you're listening to this and you want to work with a Founder like ja cream you J ice cream J ice cream you uh you you don't want to be a kerogen like you want to be positive you can you can give constructive criticism but in a positive way not in like a passive aggressive kerogenous way absolutely I think that's really a really hard line to to manage like yeah I guess if you I guess some people get mixed up with like they read stuff online about um you know somehow they read stuff online about being more combative and saying what you mean and all of this kind of stuff but they're not thinking about the fact that a huge amount of things in the world work just because people are excited about doing them and people are motivated to do them and yeah I I have that problem when I'm also talking to my team and giving my team feedback and and Laura Laura who I run AJ and smart with she's told me I do this where my team will present something to me and I'm like I don't like this I don't like this and don't like this and then she's like yeah but like then they're not excited to do it and I'm like yeah but but I don't like this and I don't like this and I don't like this so it's easy also to fall into it even if you know how it feels from the outside you know even if you don't like it it's easier for you to do it too and that that also um mixes well with your comment about like be nice on the internet uh I think like you said you how many you probably meet a lot of people in real life that you talk to on the internet right and so you Pro if you if you want to be a business person you probably don't want to be [ __ ] all over people on the internet unless you like I guess Elon can do it because he's already nailed and finished the business game but I think like it's I can't imagine you going around trolling people on on their content and on the internet well it's just not my vibe it's like going back to like personal mission statement like that's not my Mo all right let's get to books I know you got some books that matter to you these are the books I I just want to I just have a pile of books next to me and these are the books where I feel like if you're either you're struggling with your business or you're working at a company and you want to start your own business or you just want to get like a good download of good business stuff into your brain um I just have a couple of books here and I think you've probably read a lot of them Greg and I'm going to start with the most cliche most obvious one but often people have what I've noticed with entrepreneurs people have not read it because they think it's like not cool anymore to read this book and it's like it's played out and it's out of date can you guess what it is actually uh no I can't okay it's 4our work this is the book I was working in a company here in Berlin um full-time employee I picked up this book it was at my aunt's house or my or my parents place I don't know my mom reads A lot of these types of books as well and I looked at it and I was like this looks like Tony Robin it looks kind of like I don't know it looks cheesy looks it's not I think this looks cheesy and not cool and like not a Vibe anyway picked it up that's a theme of a lot of books actually in my life where I think they're going to suck and then I read them I picked this book up and it changed my brain completely uh within probably four or five days of reading it I already decided I'm going to quit my job um and start my own business I think it's one of the best books that just like lays out how to how to make money um by selling things and how to do it in a way that just doesn't burn you to the ground talks it like teaches you the absolute basics of business delegation um and there's just a lot of Concepts in here that i' never heard of in my life um and yeah it's kind of the passive income Bible it's like the digital Nomad Bible whatever it is it's the first book that I read on that topic and still holds up really well today so that's the 4-Hour Work week I think it's amazing and I think every entrepreneur in the world should read that book so it's shocking that the 4-Hour Work Week still holds up it's so good the still today I still remember the framework for the 4-Hour Work week it's basically some of the biggest you know business books all are based around like one framework and in the 4-Hour Work week it's the deal framework defin definition elimination Automation and Liberation uh so definition you know just I just sort of Googled it uh to remind myself defines the new rules for work and lifestyle design elimination focuses on eliminating unnecessary tasks and time wasters automation explains how to automate income and tasks by the way couldn't be more relevant today in an AI world and Liberation focuses on achieving mobility and freedom so I mean the Frameworks make sense and are are still relevant of course some of this stuff is not going to be as like an o oh oh my God moment like I remember reading the 4H Hour Work Week in 200 like six or whatever yeah 2005 2006 and hearing that like you can hire people vas in like different countries I was like I can't believe you can do this now everyone knows you can do that or or at Le people listening to this pod though you can do it I also love things like the the little lifestyle things in there like the mini retirements like there was just so many things in there that completely broke my brain and it's I was so lucky it's the first business book I ever read like was the four-hour Work Week by Tim Ferris and it's it's a was a completely mind-blowing experience and obviously his follow-ups like tools of Titans tribes of tribe of mentors also great but this really feels to me like also love that this book you know goes into practicalities like running Google ads to a landing page and testing the copy it's a super practical book as well it was the first time I also even learned about things like this what what's your next book so cool all right I'm just there's no they're not in any order um I'm just kind of looking the next book I I think I probably read it might have been the next book I read because Tim Ferris connected me then in his world to this book was anything you want by Derek cers uh and it's uh 40 lessons for a new kind of entrepreneur and this book really teaches me taught me about like that you just do not have to run a business the way other people are running businesses you can really just make your own you can make your own really specific brand of business this guy Derek cers again you know his other book I got to be honest I just Googled Derek cers I I've I didn't know who he was I'm very surprised about that I think this this is one of my favorite books of all time who Derrick's why is Derek is interesting he created a company called CD Baby which he sold for either 30 million so he created like a you know an online digital product uh sold it for many many many million and then he just went off and disappeared and decided to not do that anymore um and he's just living a really fun sounding life and so it's inspirational he's he's like a he's a creative I guess it connects with me he's like myp Tom that's the Myspace Tom effect yes exactly so he didn't get caught up in the money Mak generational wealth he didn't he didn't chase the general uh generational wealth Okay cool so he can teach you things and he doesn't care about like it he doesn't need any money anymore but he's teaching because he wants to teach teach and I think that's really interesting next one double your profits another old school looking book by Bob Fifer don't know if you know this one it's really really good um so this book is 78 ways to cut costs increase sales and dramatically improve your bottom line This is a book I read two days ago again and I read it almost like every quarter it's just like a good uh it's just a good reminder of little tactics and you can open up a page and there'll be a tactic in there um I think one of my favorite things is this chapter it's also one of the most highlighted ones chapter 10 step 10 and it's maximizing customer satisfaction leads to bankruptcy um and he talks about this idea of when you're creating a product and creating differentiation make sure that you only provide the elements of differentiation that the customer is willing to pay for and not those that the customer is not willing to pay for it sounds stupid but sometimes we'll make stuff at AJ and smart where like 20% of it is stuff nobody gives a [ __ ] about nobody uses but it costs us a lot of money to make it and we're making it because one or two people said they wanted it and I think remembering things like this is very important another book I'd actually like to put on the list which is behind me well I'm not going to get up it's rework by Jason Fred and David heiner Hansen that was probably this I think that was the second Business book I ever read and that definitely defined a lot of how I think about building products so rework Jason freed get them on your podcast guys if you want to get Jason freed on this podcast can you like go on to X and tell him did you see come on to Greg's podcast I saw that he replied to you yeah so yeah I uh I'm trying to get him on trying to get him on yeah he's great he's great but let me just I'll give you the best book I've ever Quicks uh Jason Freed's story just because I think it might it's interesting to you you'll find it interesting because you're like always like Greg how do you like meet everyone so I tweeted out I did I did a tweet about bootstrap businesses and then by the way we'll get to one last book recommendation after I tell this quick side tangent story so I tweeted out uh just about you know bootstrap startups and why I think they're great and and how I've been enjoying building them and Jason freed replied doesn't follow me but he replied I responded instantly I was on desktop instantly I replied and I was like you should come on the Pod and then he was like email me so I emailed him and here's what happened pull it up subject line actually here I'm just going to share my screen and the reason I'm sharing this is cu I think people might find this interesting in terms of like getting people like busy people well-known people uh and working with them in some capacity so I go hey Jason big fan so I keep I keep it really short I have a podcast that gets 250,000 downloads a month not an interview podcast just a pod where I bring in three to four half where the guest brings three to four Half Baked ideas and we jam on it if this is something of Interest I can work around your schedule just tell me when works basically and then I I include P gets include Alexis Ohanian SAR Andrew Wilkinson Jonathan Jonathan jream I actually and then I take a screenshot I know he's a busy guy so I took a screenshot of the Tweet to remind him who I am that's good that's very good yeah yeah I love that I think that's great because you're being humble and not assuming he remembers this interaction saving a time then he responds right away yeah sounds fun format sounds really interesting let me watch a recent episode today to make sure I can bring something worthwhile sound good Jason I could have easily been like absolutely sounds good but what you do you gotta That's Not My Vibe that's not your Vibe you're too good you're gonna you're gonna suggest a specific thing watch great a few options for different types of recent episodes Jonathan Courtney yep Kevin Rose big fun ideas I include the YouTube and the Spotify because I don't know what he's going to prefer Cody Schneider DJ Scrappy DJ Scrappy ideas and and Jay scream he's a friend so more of a jam haven't heard back yet but I'm I'm optimistic yeah Jason's um not uh opposed to receiving reminders well no no one's opposed to receiving reminders by the way no but as in it doesn't see yeah he he wouldn't like being bugged yeah really cool yeah he's Jason is a huge I think Jason freed cable Sasser Tim Ferris Derek cers are probably like my your Mount Rushmore my M what's the German version my my ex Tower um I think it's great to I mean yeah anyway books are like one last give us one last one one last recommendation before we head on okay I'll give you a double whammy I'll give you a double whammy the two best marketing books you can read are expert secrets and traffic Secrets expert Secrets teaches you how to talk about what you do and how to turn like a skill into something you can sell and traffic Secrets tells you how to get leads and actually these books absolutely I mean uh traffic absolutely 100 % um yeah like I I have I think almost every page of this book is highlighted um it's crazy it's it's all about list building it's all the stuff that's still super relevant today um these books are Beyond relevant like they're they're the best marketing books you can read and I think what makes them also great is that nobody I've said this before people don't people in our world don't like Russell Brunson because he's cheesy um but he's also just very smart and a very good writer and he's not trying to be clever you know what I mean he's not trying to be deep or clever he's just like here's how you do exactly this with very little anecdotes and very little just just straight into it I I really like that St cool I'm g i a new thing is that I've been doing is whenever someone who I respect mentions a book it's an auto auto Amazon order that's why you're not going to buy this one because you don't respect dude I already I already I've been buying I just went on Amazon I've and we'll include the links uh in the YouTube uh description if and only if you like subscribe comment by the way if you're going to like this YouTube video which you should I want you to click the thumbs up button but because you liked it so much click it again when you click it again it's actually going to unlike unlike it but then I want you to like it again so it's like three times you like it so much even though it's only going to register once or click it really hard because we yeah just click it really hard all right I want to see those injuries could you guys also let us know what you think about my hair like did you prefer it longer I I like it longer personally it's like more it's more C you prer it longer I don't I don't want to be my personality already now you know you know what the issue with your hair is is it's it's not short and it's not long it's medium it's it's mid it's midlength do you agree um and for anyone I I kind of like it I like the It doesn't go in my mouth I didn't like that the like when I was eating with my when my hair always like to hear it would go in my mouth L and this is going to sound really you've changed you used to like like the hair in your mouth I used to like Harry M this is another thing and this sounds really stupid and I don't care about your audience complaining about me rambling but when my hair was longer I felt more chill as in I felt like I felt like I couldn't not be chill like you know what I mean it's like wearing baggy clothes and having long hair makes you feel different I don't know how to describe it I needed a haircut because I felt like I wanted to go into a new phase where I was a big bit more like switched on and a bit more I I I can't describe it you ever see the Roy ten bombs yeah a very long time ago so I'm not sure remember Richie tab bomb he he has like really the tennis player has like really long hair and then he like shaves his head yeah I kind of remember it anyways that was your but it makes you feel different seriously it makes you it makes you feel like when my hair is long I'm kind of people assume first of all that I'm super not that I'm super like I'm not that I mean I'm not chilled out in the way that many people would think with my hair me dude you run you run a successful business you you're busy I'm busy yeah I'm busy you wouldn't think it with the the hair so anyway guys I'm I am being 100% serious about the comments um on the hair thing so cool well I'm glad we ended on that note it's been real

Title: How I use Reddit and AI to find winning startup ideas
Published: 2024-07-26 15:00:16 UTC
Description:
In this episode, we dive deep into the process of finding validated startup ideas from Reddit using AI tools. I share my 4-step process and demonstrate how to use www.gummysearch.com/community to discover trending subreddits, identify problems and solutions, find creators in the niche, and create content that resonates with the audience.

1) Use Gummy Search to find trending subreddits

• Focus on 10k-100k member communities
• These answer the "why now" question
• Look for niches where you have an unfair advantage
• Pro tip: Check daily/weekly/monthly growth trends

2) Analyze subreddit for problems & solutions

• Add chosen subreddit to a Gummy Search "audience"
• Examine "pain and anger" section for common patterns
• Check "advice requests" for what people are asking
• Review "solution requests" for competitive landscape
 • Key: Look for recurring themes and write them down!

3) Identify creators in the niche

• Use Perplexity.ai to find top influencers
• Search YouTube for their most popular videos
• Read comments to understand audience needs
• Do this for 20-25 videos to get deep insights
• This helps you think like your target audience

4) Wireframe your solution

• Based on insights, sketch out your product/service
• Use tools like Framer to quickly prototype
• Come up with a catchy, relevant name
• Example: DesignScientist.com for conversion-focused design

5) Bonus: Creating content that resonates

• Use Gummy Search's "top content" feature
• Analyze what performs well in the community
• Ask AI about content preferences (e.g., "Do they love memes?")
• Remember: Treat AI tools as your "entrepreneurial assistant"

okay you're in for a treat today I'm going to share my entire process all the AI tools I use to come up with startup ideas from Reddit how to find gold within Reddit I don't know why more people aren't doing this uh I've I've come up with startup ideas from Reddit that have built me multi-million dollar businesses uh there's just so many validated ideas out there and it's it's the place I go to when I'm looking for a startup idea but I'm really looking for a validated startup idea I'm looking for an idea that I know that with a good chance if I go and build this people will resonate with it [Music] start so uh without further Ado I'm going to share exactly how to find new ideas are validated how to find gold uh the you know the four-step process I use and if you stick around to the end I'll also show you how to create content people will love because it's it's not about just building a product anymore you need to attract an audience you need to build a community and content is so key with that so I'll show you how I use Reddit to actually come up with content ideas so I'll just go ahead and and share my screen so so the first thing I do is I use a tool called Gummy Search and it's free to sign up they also have a paid plan I'm using the paid plan and where I go is I go to the trending section within Gummy Search now I could see here are the top subreddits sorted by largest sorted by active sorted by growing and what I'm generally looking at is how fast is this thing growing daily weekly monthly yearly um so I can see you know Galaxy Ring the rich subreddit you know India Sports so I get a good sense of it but the mistake people uh make here is they they focus just on these big subreddits what I like to do is actually go to the 10,000 to 100,000 member subreddits these aren't the massive subreddits but they're the ones that there's you know it answers the why now question why should I go and build something for this community well it's generally a newer Community uh it's trending it's in people's minds it's in the Zeitgeist so as you can see here it's starting to sort by 10 to 100 th um and I just you know I'll just scroll it I'll just scroll it you know and just you know see what I find interesting and I'll ask myself okay autistic with ADHD is there something here do I do I have an unfair advantage in that um in that you know subreddit maybe I know someone who who suffers or am someone who suffers from that from that and I can go and build something for them um so I just go and I I start looking and scrolling and I ask myself what you know is this interesting uh do I have an ability to create something here and I just start taking notes you know pull out a notebook pull out a Google doc and just say saying what's you know are there any is there anything here that's really interesting to me you can also change the time frame so you can say I only want the top you know growing subreddits that uh are growing a lot daily um and sometimes you get some interesting uh interesting responses to that that you wouldn't otherwise get in sort of the monthly or or or the or the larger one so um I I I tend to play around with these the da there's weekly and there's monthly so you know if you're looking for a niche I would check something like gummy search like this every few weeks to see what's new and they also have a curated uh you know curated section where you can go in and you can say Okay they've already curated the 26 subreddits for software Engineers um or software developers and you can go and and add that to your audience and this is something I look at too but I'm I'm more interested in seeing what's growing and why is it growing because those again those are the opportunities and you know the 10 to 100,000 is is the range uh where where you want to look at so that's step one go and see what's trending within within Reddit the next step is once you've picked uh a subreddit that you think's interesting it's about how do you find the problems and potentially solutions to that subreddit so that's going to help give you I mean you need to come up with a startup idea right because you're going to charge money for it um and uh these are agency businesses that you can start there SAS businesses that you can start uh they Marketplace businesses software businesses um brick and mortar businesses cpg businesses you know you're going to see through the problems and solution and the beauty is Gummy Search allows you to find that pretty easily so let's go pick a uh a subreddit that we think is interesting so we're in the 10 to 100,000 let's say in the growing and let's what's something that okay plastic surgery too big too big 265,000 no let's go to 10 to 100,000 okay dog food so we're going to go and add to audience so you create the way gummy works is you create these audiences so you can see in the past I've created like dentists and designers it's kind of like what is the community so you know people into dog food and then you can include similar subreddits into what's called an audience has added eight communities to the audience people into dog food beautiful so see now I have all these people into dogs and this is where the magic happens what they do is I could go they basically organize it into pain and anger uh hot discussions top content advice requests solution requests money talk you know all this stuff here and when I'm looking for a problem solution I want to see what's the pain and anger right so I go and click the pain and anger and what of the things I really love to do is see what are the common patterns you know within this community so it uses AI to basically go through uh here you can see 53,9 49 words and it summarizes all these submissions it's going to find you know Common patterns and this is going to help me uh basically you know come up with um ideas for you know people into dog food and and dog community it takes about 20 seconds I'll take this you know brief moment to say like subscribe and comment on this video uh if if you you know I'm giving away all my secrets here so if you want more of this type of content please like subscribe and comment it's the only way it's the only way I know I should continue creating content like this so wow all right we're all set so now you can see a bunch of different patterns so you can see potty training challenges with new or rehomed so there seems to be you know a bunch of Interest around you dog struggling with potty trains dogs reluctant to walk outside uh loss of of a dog loss of a best friend you know eating habits loss of appetites are you not coming up with ideas right now because that's how my brain works um you start reading this and you're like wait maybe there's something I can I can build here to help you know dogs with you know potty training maybe there's content I can create that is just all about you know this topic you know dogs reluctant to walk outside as they get older or you know just you know being stubborn you know stubborn dogs.com you know just thinking of you know you start reading through this and it gives you ideas it's wonderful you start writing it down again you go to your Google doc and you start writing it down what would be an idea idea here what would be an idea there and I know there's there's people listening to this that are going to say well there already exists you know dog Pony training you know businesses um and that might be true and and and and you definitely need to go and do some research and be like okay what's the competitive landscape in this space um but more often than not you'll notice that you know the marketing is bad and they're not doing anything on social and you know there there's an opportunity to partner with creators and you can create a pretty simple MVP nowadays that uh you can create a nice small business maybe you already have a full-time job but you can you know create a business that doesn't take much work that starts you know producing cash flows that ultimately be could become something that you go do full-time or you're just looking for a startup idea uh and you go all in so anyways I digress you know going back to to the patterns you can just sort of go and you can read it and it does a really good job at just um you know summarizing some of the biggest you know pain and anger the next thing I I generally click is the advice and requests category so this is beautiful so this actually uh it's going to summarize what you know what are the advice that people are asking for you know in these in all these communities you know there's there's so many times that there's thousands of people that are are asking about hey like I need what do you what should I what product should I buy here what should I do here these are people screaming they're screaming they want they want these products to exist and it's your job to go and figure out how to build it how do you build it efficiently and how do I you know Market it efficiently to these people um but the ideas are out there so here here you can see you know people there's some patterns around dog dog breeding uh recommendation I always sort of look to see you know how many upvotes and comments these things give you know are getting you you definitely there there are are times sometimes that Gummy Search isn't 100% accurate so you know you want to double check these things um but yeah it gives me like a direction a directional okay A lot of people are asking for dog breeds okay what breed a dog would you recommend uh what's best for us um you know maybe there's like a website you can go and create that you know take you know there's a survey and and and you you know based on who you are and you know which trips you like to go on and what m music maybe it's you know you put in your you log in with your Spotify and and based on that it gives you a dog breed um these will give you ideas so you just start reading through um all the advice here that people are giving and there's there's other ideas here and other uh advice requests you can see dog food recommendations interesting our poodle mix is losing his teeth due to old age um so there might be an opportunity to to build something you know a soft a way softer dog food um focused on Senior Dogs um so you just I just scroll through it and I start again writing down mental stimulation for dogs how to keep my dog mentally stimulated ways to entertain not such a clever dog um and you just go and you scroll and you and you write notes and then one there's another there's you know another piece on Gummy Search I love I love checking out is the solution requests and I always checked this out last the solution requests is is basically is basically people saying you should do this you know here's what I use this will give you a sense around competitive landscape different products that people are using how people are dealing with all their problems um and uh this is you know super super worthwhile to get a sense of just the lay of the land so uh dog food recommendations uh you can just you know SC scroll here and see you know what are the products here so this will help you basically just give you a good competitive landscape um and and you can go ahead and write that down on your Google doc that will serve as like a one pager for your your business idea once I've figured out the problems in Solutions then what I do is and I've written out this one pager I go and say who are the creators in this Niche so generally what I do is I use a perplexity doai it's it's free to sign up you know usually what I'll what I'll prompt is something like who you know actually I'll say give me the 25 most popular dog influencer on YouTube and it'll list it out I'll put this usually in a uh in a uh Google sheet or something like that and the reason I do that is you know okay why you're asking yourself okay why are you doing this like why you know why does it why do I care about the creators well generally what I do here is I'll go and find these creators so I'll go to YouTube someone named Doug the Pug I land on Doug the Pug and I don't think this is going to be super valuable sometimes you have to go back to you know perplexity and be like I don't want funny YouTubes I'm talking about the top youtubeers that are educational for dogs here we go now we're getting like dog trainers um dog training tutorials now we're talking so let's just say okay we're going to go to Kiko pup so I pull up Kiko pup 43,000 subscribers perfect so I'll go to her videos usually I like to support by most po uh sort by most popular so I can see here um complete guide to Poppy training what to train first so I get to our puppy training tutorial and then what I like to do here is with 741 comments like they are the top comments and of course there's going to be people joking about um about the comment about the video um but when you start reading some of these comments you get a sense to what people want you get a sense of uh what are they thinking about and you you can you just I put myself in their shoes you know you can just whistle like this proceed to do the most melodious whistle of all time you know this is the just you just go through it go through it and start reading you just start reading this and uh you you know it just helps you to put yeah again put you put yourself in their shoes and I do this with about um you know maybe 20 or 25 videos and I start writing what am I learning on my on my one pager then what I do is I I wireframe out the website so I'll give you an example you know uh I found in one of the niches uh for startup Entre R preneurs using you know Gummy Search that people are upset with designers that people you know designers there's there's just just artist and my website looks might look beautiful but it doesn't convert or it doesn't actually do anything so uh I you know started wireframing out um what a design agency would look like that actually cared about copy and conversion and getting people to click and get you cash and basically this mix between copywriter and marketer and designer and I just like I mean took a you know made a framer website and wire framed out what this would look like based on um the insights that I gathered from Reddit and I just put it up so I wire framed it up put it up in a few hours on framer and uh just started posting about it so this is that's my process to find ideas it's just you know Finding trending subreddit see what's validated see what their problems are see what their Solutions are uh start writing this down wireframing it out come up with a catchy name so when I'm when you go through all these subreddits sometimes what you can do is actually you can create a company with the same name as the subreddit um so it's not just about coming up with a cat you know a a validated you know catchy startup idea it's about what's a validated catchy name that's going to resonate with people as you can see here design science in.com it's a new category it's different and I I got this Insight you know when some you people were like you know I wish a designer was more like a scientist less art more science so you're going to get these insights from just going through this um and last but not least I'll be true to my word how to create content people will love well here I use Gummy Search what I do here is let's go back to the dog food here go to top content and you just look at what's the best performing content right you're going to get again the common patterns you're going to get the common patterns and you see what's working and you can iterate from there you see the types of formats that work is it you know long stories is it memes like what does this audience care about what does this community care about um you can see loss of beloved pet seeking attention today I saved a dog's life like stories like this so again you go through this and the same process that you come up with startup ideas you come up with content ideas through here it works absolutely brilliantly and you can even ask questions and you can do this with you know uh solution requests and pain and anger on Gummy Search too but you can also ask it a question about top content in this audience do they love memes and again just really fun to play with you you'll learn stuff so here you can see that you know comments like snuggle puddle a literal dog pile you know it's it's a mem like uh Community it's not like people are saying they love memes but uh you again you start asking a question I use Gummy Search and products like this is kind of like an entrepreneurial assistant it's your co-founder except you don't have to pay them or you have to pay for Gummy Search if you want access to this um but you don't you know you don't have to pay them a salary you don't have to give them Equity so you just you know ask them questions and it'll it'll connect dots it within your brain so there you have it I hope this was uh interesting to you to me what I love so much about using Reddit and social YouTube and Tik Tok to come up with startup ideas is it's like you're teleporting to different communities and your job is to just observe and write and come up with ideas that is are going to resonate with them and I've just I've seen this you know work time and time again where uh like design scientist.com is you know it's a seven figure business from this from from this uh methodology it's it's it's doable um and uh I I I'm happy to create more content like this uh more videos like this showing you how to how I cook in the kitchen and uh you know but just let me know in the comments if if you enjoyed it um and let me know what you end up building happy building everyone and uh I'll see you later [Music]

Moes are dead and brand is the only moat you know Peter teal says like the best way to compete is to not compete and I think that brand is the best way you can do that where if you occupy enough mental space for a category no one is searching for an alternative like basically the strategy for startups right now is to be Coca-Cola it's like why do you drink Coca-Cola not because of Any like like lock in or anything it's because it's Coca-Cola I think that brand is the best mode out there this year [Music] Danny Grant I am so excited to have you here and I was really I woke up today I was like really excited to have you here because I know you're an idea machine and then you tweet out something that I just I I was so excited so you tweet out before Jam which is your your Venture back startup I think you've rais $9 or10 million there were 141 startup ideas we didn't build about to share them for the first time on Greg eisenberg's podcast and now I'm just salivating so my co-founder and I met when we were product managers at Cloud flare and we loved working together so much so that after I left Cloud Flair we did like a hack hackathon weekend trip to Colorado we got like a cabin in the woods and we like hacked on Startup ideas and we just knew we're GNA start something together we just didn't know what and so what does any enterprising you know mid 20s person do when they know they're going to start something is they create a notion of ideas and we filled it with all sorts of ideas we had over the course of like a couple weeks and there are now 141 ideas in this notion and we got super lucky because here's what happened we had like a call scheduled to go through our notion and pick what startup to start and before we could even open this dock we just started gossiping about our old team and talking about this crazy like pm engineer process like that that was happening right now in the team it was like it was early covid no one was set up for remote an Engineers were like asked to be like updating like spreadsheets and jira it was it was insanity and we're like wait should we just solve a problem that we have faced ourselves instead of any of these ideas and I've got to tell you I am so happy we did because the thing that I did not appreciate on day one of being a Founder is that if this goes to plan this is actually probably the next 105 years of your life and so to work on something that I love the user of because I've been that person and that like I resonate with the prop like I feel like we dodged a bullet but now we've got a lot of ideas to share with the people listening to you perfect win-win situation and I actually didn't realize that you were a cloud flare at the end of this episode I'll tell you the story of how uh how I met the founders of cloud flare when I was just a kid from a Facebook group so we'll I'll share that at the end are you serious yeah I'll share that at the the end but uh all right we're not going to get to all 141 of course but of course I don't want to waste a second what's what's your first idea for us okay idea one K-pop style factories for particular Talent when you're building a startup there are certain unicorn hes you just have to make but every single startup has to make the same unicorn hires like here's an example when a startup hires their first growth marketer that's a specialized hire it is a hard hire to find like our first marketer we spent eight months searching like really searching but that's a set of skills and you can teach it and so you could imagine a world in which there's a K-pop style Factory where they are churning out the first growth marketer for startups and people will pay a lot and they'll they'll they'll pay to not have to spend eight month searching and to have the person start the next day when honestly they needed someone yesterday and didn't start hiring soon enough so there's so there's a lot of programs for technical talent that exists training for technical talent but there doesn't feel like there's that much in like the growth marketer content marketer space um so are you saying like develop like you know the programs around taking someone who's not a growth marketer to become a growth marketer and then connecting those growth marketers with uh people who want to hire them is that the idea I I'm here to tell you that I love boot camps like I think coding boot camps have changed so many people's lives like I just I think they are one of the best things that's happened in education in the last 10 years but this flips it on its head that's the the code boot camp route is take people make them Junior developers at a generalized big company this is the opposite of that it's take people make them extremely senior very fast extremely specialized for a high-paying like extremely focused type of job so growth marketer is one um here's another type of job that you could do this sort of like K-pop Factory for which is a Dev evangelist when a startup needs their first Dev evangelist that person is like a superstar hire I mean like like they have they they have star power they are they're building they're great at speaking like that person is so hard to find and the only people out there that you can see doing it are the ones who are already doing it and you don't just need someone who can do it you need someone who's going to be the first and so like instead of me as a Founder any founder out there like hiring a recruiter trolling through Linkedin and Twitter and trying to interview like hundreds of people for this one super specialized role why shouldn't there just be like the factory that turns out the best people at this low acceptance rate but they like make them amazing quick ad break let me tell you about a business I invested in it's called boring marketing.com so a few years ago I met this group of people that were some of the best SEO experts in the world they were behind getting some of the biggest companies found on Google and the secret sauce is they've got a set of technology and AI that could help you outrank your competition so for my own businesses I wanted that I didn't want to have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I didn't want to depend on ads to drive customers to my businesses I wanted to rank high in Google that's why I like SEO and that's why I use boring marketing.com and that's why I invested in it they're so confident in their approach that they offer a 30-day Sprint with 100% money back guarantee who does that nowadays so check it out highly recommend boring marketing.com yeah I think it's really interesting that you're you're thinking about Job titles that are that are overlooked like the way we connected originally I don't know if you remember but you were looking for manager you were looking like for a community manager and that's like maybe less so now but at the time it was like an you know it was a a new type of role like managing discords and things like that so I think maybe maybe the the framework for people listening at least is like what are roles that are you're just starting to hear for the first time so one of those for example is design engineer totally yes yeah so I think uh what you know what you do is when you start hearing a a name for the first time and maybe it's twice three times take a note of it go to Google Google Trends see if it's going up if it's going up then the way to monetize it is it sounds like it's exactly what what you're saying through your method totally and and there's no competition out there because here's what happens today like startup founder goes to a recruiter and says I'm looking for this person and the recruiter tells them that's kind of a unicorn and you're like yeah I know I'm in the business of hiring unicorns and and the recruiter says like okay but that doesn't really work with my model because my model is um I do a bunch of work and then if if I happen to succeed then you pay me commission and so they're nervous to do a ton of upfront effort for a search that they don't have a ton of history of doing they don't have the Network for will take a ton of calls to like sift through candidates and and then they may not even find the person so this is like the opposite of that it's like you tailor make people for these positions and the reason why I think this is so impactful for the world is because it makes it easier to start companies and build like impactful businesses and like that's the way a lot of things in the future will advance is like through companies building new things but the other reason is there are a lot of people out there who need to change their life and want to change their life life but they're just not going to become Junior developers because their set of skills is different like the thing that they can contribute to the world is different and so having multiple paths for someone to change their life and and impact the world positively is a really really great thing for everyone and if you were to start this like how how would you start this how much money would it require what tools would you use yes so you've heard like first well you you are the you are the champion of this it's like first time Founders like over focus on product and second time Founders know to focus on distribution I think that that uh product here is not the hard part it's the distribution because you both have to build trust in your quality but also you need to find people at the right moment to sell this and so I think the first thing you do is you just start by building your own distribution your own platform and you do the things that like you Greg have been doing which is like start the podcast start the newsletter tweet every day and like build trust as the person who gets what this role is yeah I think uh I want to give two examples of that concrete example so there was an account Julian Shapiro used to run something uh he's an entrepreneur he used to run something called demand curve and and bell curve um they were you know growth businesses and the one of the ways that he got a lot of traction is he created a Twitter account called growth tactics at growth tactics oh was so good so good so good so we got a really good name uh you'd be surprised some of these names are still available and just started sharing growth tactics and then people would see it uh on their feet and they're like do I you know do I want some more growth tactics in my feed yeah absolutely click follow so it started to grow pretty quickly and all of a sudden he had you know a bunch you know thousands of people interest startups Founders who are interested in growth tactics and then he sold them courses and services and that sort of thing so I think one good idea here is to just kind of grab like a um generic sounding name and and go and build a Twitter or LinkedIn account for that that's one one idea that's what I would do yeah I have a Counterpoint to this let's do it I believe that that would work but I wonder if it still works well in like 2025 and the reason for that is I think people are moving away from trusting Anonymous accounts to trusting people and here's an example of that we're hiring right now a role that I wish there was a K-pop Factory for because we're going to spend the next 10 months searching for this like unicorn person and this is a designer to lead a growth team it's just such a specialized role and you need someone very very senior who's super thoughtful and like it's a hard um job to hire for so there is a website called growth design that has a ton of these case studies and the case studies are so awesome it's a great website I've spent hours on this website also there's this woman Kate suuma she was an early growth designer at Meo she's since left and started a consultancy but she's like started a podcast and newsletter um and she like writes on LinkedIn a lot when I was looking for this person originally I didn't reach out to the growth design team to find a hire I reached out to her to see if she knows anyone and there's something about people that might be better at getting like um just inbound interest the other so for people who don't know growth grow. design they make these comic books and they break down it's beautiful so great go check it out yeah they break down different ux flows and they basically uh kind of commentate it with uh they commentate it with um user psychology and stuff like that and it just it's it's absolutely brilliant but I think that's another thing is it's animated so you don't really like feel connected to anyone um so yeah I agree with you there um makes sense all right what else you got okay here's another one before a startup is ready actually let me start with the title which is like Bounty program for Dev evangelism before a startup is ready for their first Dev evangelist hire they need to write docs they need to write starters like tutorials they need to create like starter GitHub repos uh video videos there's a ton of Dev evangelism that needs to happen even before you have the capacity for a full-time hire and it usually falls on the founder who has a lot of other stuff they are doing and at that moment would be very happy to pay someone to do like a 95% good job on the like basic stuff that they need to get started you could imagine a bounty program where Junior developers all over the world are like oh great this startup needs a getting started tutorial this startup needs how to use their tool with zapier and and just one by one uh is able to contribute who else is doing that Fiverr yeah that's what I was thinking like there's it feels like there's no competition for that yeah I think that's right I think that um the hard part about this is um there's a like as of as a Founder honestly I'd pay a lot for good quality work but I wouldn't pay a lot for bad quality work that we'd have to redo right and so um the benefit of a dedicated Marketplace for this over a Fiverr is that the reviews can be tailor made to the platform and they can just have a really high bar the way that like uber has a high bar for drivers or Airbnb for places do you think this is a profitable cash flowing business or do you see this potentially being like a VC back thing I think this is a cash flow profitable business and I think it gets even more profitable over time just given the like decline of the cost of producing software like right now you may even need to like hire a developer to build the platform and all the features but like pretty soon that's like if you've seen like versel like vzero dodev it will like design and build it for you like just fast forward a few years and so then it's like okay you're one person you can run this thing can you just explain to people what uh VZ is and how that would extend to this it is well it is pure magic and what it is is it's AI that builds the website for you so you say what website you're looking for and it will generate it the full thing it's crazy it's so awesome because it's such a preview of how the future will be like today if you need some sort of service you have like a whole company to create that service like like how many Engineers work at Yelp but in the future there will be some sort of public database of things and then when you want the service it can just be automatically generated for you in that time and like that's not five years out but maybe it's a hundred years out or 50 years out I don't know but like when I see vzer I'm like oh cool the future is arriving soon this is this is this is firing me up this is why you're on the Pod right now because I feel like you have such a good sense to where things are going um I want to keep the ideas going what what what else you got let m uals invest in VC funds what you would do is you'd create a shadow LP that becomes an LP in all these funds and then allows the general public to be a part of to be to be part of that LP so like what it would have brought an access to is like you as a 25-year-old could buy aund $100 of a16 Z's you know fund whatever whether or not the VCS will enjoy that TBD but do people want it 100% yes yeah that was my first question to that is like if you're a16z do you you know they whole not them I don't want to pick on them exactly but the the idea is like there's there's like five funds that are really really hard to get into and they curate their LPS really really carefully and they don't let regular people uh invest like like you or me and but the problem is I think that they want to keep it that way yes yeah this this is this is for the record an idea that won't work and it it won't like and and there are more reasons than that that it won't work it's like also they love not having to share their fund like returns with the general public and this would change that like it's like for all the all the reason this won't work this is sort of an idea kind of like allow Harvard to accept more students and it's like that's not really what they do yeah but it's actually really interesting so and you know when you come with come up with a bad idea you know on this podcast we say if an idea is good you sip the idea and if if if if the idea is not good you spit it sometimes these spit ideas actually get you down the line of thinking of a good idea so for example with with this idea your Insight was right your Insight is that Millennials see you know use a lot of these software businesses use lot of these cpg businesses uh they they would rather invest in that than the S&P 500 Insight correct but the execution of this is difficult because the other side of the marketplace so to speak doesn't really want that to happen so the question is what can you build for Millennials such that they get that same feeling around you know that same warm and fuzzy feeling that they would have gotten totally at the time that we wrote this notion dock a company had just launched called Otis which was uh this the skillshare founder launching a new Financial startup and it allowed like I guess it's targeted for young people but allowed anyone to invest in like alternative assets like art and sneakers and just own a part of culture and uh when I saw that I was like that's super inspiring what else do Millennials want to be a part of and I was like a6c I there's something there and someone in the comment section is going to be like here's where I should take yeah yeah so feel free so keep let us know in the comments section um I'm just GNA keep saying what else you got what else you got what else you got what else you got at the at the time so this one is okay the one more theme that I got very interested in at the time was these in-person events and I think that now is the time to start in inperson things because we're all so we all realized just how precious they are but they're all really hard to start because the quality bar for what you'll attend a second time that's in person is just super high and so um there is an amazing company called soar sounds are you familiar uh a little bit I've never been to one of their events so tell me more about it they are concerts in people's homes but the thing that they just got right is they are they got the formula that you can trust and you don't what you're going to get until you show up so you know it's going to be 60 Minutes three bands play like 10 minutes each with like breaks in the middle so you show up and then you know that they've curated the quality so one idea in this Doc is so far sounds for talks where like I love that format it's such an easy and fun thing to go and do it's novel each time but sitting and listening to music for an hour like isn't everyone's Jam but what could be is sort of more like a variety show where you you show up and there going to be three three talks maybe one is like a comedian one is like a scientist and and you just and and that's that's the format and that's the that's the in-person um event uh Empire I think so far was was and is really onto something which is that events haven't really changed in years like they' basically stayed the same so they were kind of like okay how do we you know W with the with the trend around stadium shows and bigger and bigger shows and festivals how do we do the complete opposite and they did it and I think they're doing quite well um I think they're doing like eight figures in Revenue uh or so so they're they're doing really well but I think that there's so far sounds for X is kind of the idea that you're saying which is you know which I think I think the the the hard part with this is choosing like which Community you want to go after and what is the utility for the the event so for example so far sounds a lot of people go to those events at least in my like and anecdotally it's like they're going on a first date basically there it's like it's kind of perfect right it's like 60 Minutes you know it's it's not you're just going to a bar or something like that you're like doing something a little interactive and then after you can talk about it and and there'll probably be cool people there um so if you were doing you know so besides so for your example like talks comedians scientists like those to me like there's probably so far sounds for science so far sounds for comedy so far sounds for you know talks what do you think about that I think it's more generalized people want to be entertained and so it's so far sounds For Your Entertainment and you know that the quality bar is going to be good I think that the part is not choosing um a category the hard part is the brand where my co-founder says this like so eloquently and I'm going to butcher this but his philosophy which I think is so right is that Moes are dead and brand is the only Moe it's like we used to all talk about Network effects and like you know build something like Twitter but if you think about all the software tools you use right now there's not really a network effect there's not really a network effect for notion like maybe there's like like we can come up with some but why did you choose notion it's because the brand is just so strong like basically the strategy for startups right now is to be Coca-Cola it's like why do you drink Coca-Cola not because of Any like like lockin or anything it's because it's Coca-Cola and so the why do you show up to a sofar sounds with a first date it's because you know it's going to be a high quality hour of your life and so I think the hard part is to establish that trust and to maintain it I stand corrected also I love that line that line is so good I'm going to reuse that all the time and you're right with with notion specifically like we use notion we probably have like 70 or 80 people on notion and there is no network effects because I've thought about it too because we're thinking about moving off of it and now it's just there were Network effects with some of these businesses when it was really hard to get the graph on there but like you know it's really easy to to post a link on slack and get my team to use something else you know um so when people were saying network effects were everything that was like in 2005 2006 2007 when that was a lot harder I agree you know Peter teal says like the best way to compete is to not compete and I think that brand is the best way you can do that where if you occupy enough mental space for a category no one is searching for an alternative when we started Jam we didn't search for what's the best knowledge base we just use notion because their brand is so strong I think that brand is the best mode out there this year 100% the the thing really to to end on is to say that like there are things that I did not appreciate on day one of starting a startup about choosing your idea that I really wish that I had known on day one or like we sort of lucked into but I think are helpful for people who are on day one of choosing what to work on the first thing is that if if the startup goes to plan like if all your dreams come true this is probably like 10 to 20 years of your life which is really a lot like we started Jam when I was 26 this is probably going to be all my 30s and so that's very exciting but it's only exciting if you love what you do and the thing that I didn't realize on day one is that it's a has to be exciting enough that you're going to say no to a lot of other opportunities that come your way but B it's it is going to be like you are going to think and talk about your company like all the time because it's not just at work it's you go see your family and your family is like how's the business doing and you go see your friends and they're like how's the startup and you like meet people at parties and they're like what are you working on and then like they have follow-up questions so you're just con like like you are in that space all the time and so you better find the thing fascinating enough to talk about it for 10 years straight the second is when Once the thing starts working then you have this question of like okay well great like now now how how do we like a THX this thing and you kind of want to know on day one that there is a to that you don't have to know what the exact path is but just having like people call this like an idea maze but just having like here's what needs to happen to make this so worthwhile to spend a ton of time on um is is really helpful and the last thing is that the type of business you start dictates how you will spend your time and who you will talk to and what you will wear and like and what your life will be like so we started a business targeting developers I get to spend all day every day talking to developers it is awesome I love it but if we had started something where I have to wear a suit all the time or I have to travel a ton um or like there are just a lot of different uh types of businesses to start and you should choose one that fits your personality because it should be energizing in your day rather than very detracting there's only one thing I'll push back on in in what you just said which is the business will take up 10 15 plus years of your life for some businesses that's absolutely true and but I think we're entering this new era of micro businesses so you know 10 15 20 50 years ago when you wanted to create a business it was this it was this it was like clowning Mount Everest in terms of like what you needed to get done you know back in the day when it was there was no internet and you wanted to let's say make a store like you had to go and like find the location and spend so much money renovating it and painting and merchandising and getting the suppliers um you know then 15 20 years ago if you wanted to put an e-commerce or you have to like build your own shopping cart um there was no Shopify now what's cool is you can stand on the shoulders of giants and there is like a lower kind of a lower risk way of putting things out there um now these businesses might not you know be as big biggest Jam um and you might need to create a portfolio of them to end up you know making it meaningful but that's my take on the business needs to be 10 to 15 years okay it's you're right it's true but something that I underappreciated on the first day of jam is I was I used to be a product manager and I sort of thought all about product and I was like the hard part of building this is building the product but building the product is like now you can just even get started and and the rest of the journey is is you're creating a movement that helps people improve their lives in a particular way and just social change takes time and behavior change takes time and the environment changes around you and so you're just you're like if it's not something where people are going to search for this tool and it's going to be the the top search result in SEO always and that like if the distribution doesn't come naturally you're you're embarking on a very long journey and a lot longer than I sort of appreciated 100% yeah I I feel you I feel you on that you know and especially if you take Venture that's also like you're definitely signing yourself up for the the a chapter of your life and where you know I guess the difference is some businesses are chapters and some businesses are pages and know the difference between a page and a chapter yeah I think that's right um before we head out I need to tell you quickly the story of how I met Michelle Zin from the co-founder of uh of cloud Flair and her husband uh Jamie I think his name is I'm dying to know so I think and he was also involved in Cloud flare I think Jamie was was he I don't know not that I know of but it's yeah maybe so people know this I'm Canadian when I first came out to San Francisco I didn't know anyone but there was this Facebook group called ac781 and ac781 St stood for Air Canada 781 the flight from uh Montreal to San Francisco and for whatever reason I was in this group and I was like coming to San Francisco looking to sublet a place I didn't know anyone I was probably like 20 years old or something and Michelle responded and she's like hey I've got this startup called Cloud flare and like we've got this uh we've got this space and it's a studio and she rented it to me for like nothing literally out of the goodness of her own heart and uh really got me like hooked onto San Francisco and and uh changed my life from that little moment and I think you never know who you're going to meet you know now I mean now Cloud fair is like a$ 20 billion company you never know who you're going to meet and uh it was just so cool how and positive and and how she gave back so I will say there's power in community and uh shoot your shot wow that's an amazing story and like what a like warm and like beautiful thing to do yeah totally Danny it's been a pleasure uh people please like and comment the YouTube video If you're not watching this on YouTube Just Get on YouTube and like it and comment on it I hate I hate that I say this now but it actually gets the video spread and gets

crypto not crypto blockchain is a fantastic solution to the idea of how do you enumerate value on the internet and Trust for it in a way that is just by science a trustworthy and I think that that ultimately benefits the receiver of the value that you're creating online and you in a in in in an open market that people can in transparent way acknowledge each other's value and Trust and that's that's the layer that we're missing on the on the internet to take it to to a to a place where um a c value by individual is much more transparent and efficient and the products we're getting for people are better because there is accountability because when you make money you want to make the product better you want to retain your customers you want to make sure that they're happy you want to make sure that they're coming back you want to make sure they get a V2 and a V3 and a V4 and you are much why because when you do that you make more money you know so I want to summarize our entire conversation in four steps so this is what I've learned this is what I've learned from this conversation how to create a product people want number one [Music] find okay so Ben Ruben live from Soho Ben is the guy that I call if I have a big idea he kind of he always knows it feels like he always knows where things are the direction where things are going so if I ever need a gut check text Ben hey I'm thinking about this big idea what do you think he's sold a company to Epic Games house party he started mircat which was a live streaming it was IG live before IG live was a thing and now he's working in the crypto space and building well we'll talk more about it but he's building kind of community infrastructure for the crypto web um so when when Ben talks I listen and he's got a ton of crypto ideas that he came prepared with and I know people some people are listening to this and I would say 93% of our audience isn't in the crypto world so their their guards are up to be honest I'm um I I I studied architecture school and I still build digital spaces and I mean the crypto side of you're right I am I am backed by crypto investors and I'm I hire crypto engineers and we are in the crypto industry but by all accounts the job of what we're building is to build intimacy uh in the internet without making it smaller and blockchain is just a is just a a technology that we're using to create a set of communities that are permissionless meaning anyone can join but they organize around a new type of graph that is is trust and we'll get into this but you know I just wanted to jump in and say like you know that that's true that you know if it's walk like a dock and it talks like a dock it's maybe a dog and it quacks like oh whatever the saying is um but we we fundamentally see our job as here in what we do is how do we create a more intimate space and blockchain just just is is a is a way to get people to trust that the other side of the people on the keyboard actually have the same things to lose and the same things to gain by the information that they are sharing together um and I think that's that's where the internet is going and where it's it's uh and where a lot of value is going to come especially as it's expanded in the speed of light and with AI like in 10 years from now it's going to be really important to know is this person on the other side really did what they do or do they really have the same amount of you know podcast listeners do they actually live in Miami did they actually go to the school do they actually you know all of these things are going to have some sort of um way online to verify that they happen and I think that that brings a new type of graph uh that uh uh it's it's it's important for us as Builder to be curious about and see can we create a better internet when we are not organizing People based on self- attestation but actually based on the things that they have done and experienced and can we create better conversations like this and much more grounded conversation so short stories yes I do a lot of things in crypto but I'm definitely not motivated uh the motivation is not crypto by self the motivation is how do you create a group of 10,000 people or 100,000 people where they're there because they have the same things to gain and the same things to lose uh and that's the kind of conversation they have and I think the internet become much more powerful like this the other thing I think is really interesting about building in crypto right now is if you can if you compare crypto to let's say AI there's way more competition in the AI space like building on top of you know building gbt rappers and stuff like that everyone's trying to do that but with crypto because it's it hasn't hit you know the mainstream adoption and there's PE you know but it just feels like there's less competition so there's opportunities for people to see what are the new protocols coming out how do I build something on top of it that's actually going to create value and as the tide shift and as the industry matures you know you end up swimming Downstream instead of upstream and it's just there's less competition so um I always try to look at like what are things that are low status right now or medium status and not high and that will be high status in two or three or four years because that's where the Arbitrage is and I think that's where we're at with crypto and to your point everything exists in IM balance so when you look at the things that are like um you know not not the hottest things right now you have to ask yourself okay how do they compare how do they and if at all are they in dialogue with the thing that is hot and what what is the kind of energy that is balancing in it because you you can think about it almost like as one of one of the most interesting things as an observer and builder in the space and you know you and I been around the block I don't know for 13 years more doing doing what we do and um I I find it so interesting that AI is this let's let's think about the motivation of AI the set of ideas that it is it's it's highly centralized you know in order to run a service like open AI quick ad break let me tell you about a business I invested in it's called boring marketing.com so a few years ago I met this group of people that were some of the the best SEO experts in the world they were behind getting some of the biggest companies found on Google and the secret sauce is they've got a set of technology and AI that could help you outrank your competition so for my own businesses I wanted that I didn't want to have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I didn't want to depend on ads to drive customers to my businesses I wanted to rank high in Google that's why I like SEO and that's why I use boring marketing and that's why I invested in it they're so confident in their approach that they offer a 30-day Sprint with 100% money back guarantee who does that nowadays so check it out highly recommend boring marketing.com but like all of the all of the the those companies need to be massive and hold a a huge amount of information right not only that it is also creating the type of content that is looking back and replicating itself to create above average answers right so AI is this kind of like oh the internet got to the place of maturity both on the computation level and the centralization level that it can actually become its own being and self reproduce and on the other side you have crypto which is actually working on the opposite direction which is how can you enumerate identities and make proofs and you know as you think about what's going to be the balancing act when somebody can load up all the content of G Greg Eisenberg all the voice of of Greg all the photos all the things that he wrote everything and create something that is you know can maybe even create podcasts you know and do this interviews right and like uh and and and and and even with your permission even with your permission Greg just like extend yourself 100 times or a thousand times that is almost um that that is almost it bags the question of like okay so when do I know though this is the real Greg that I'm talking to the real Greg and what are the ways to prove online that I'm talking to the to the actual guy and another thing that it's is interesting to consider is that I don't know why but I have this instinctive belief that all derivative assets eventually um increase the value of the original asset meaning uh in a way pickle ball just the more pickle ball is out there the most the more the value of 10 is going up the more you know the more the more there is uh you know ERC 20s coins the more the value of of ethereum goes out uh the more knockoffs to Prada the more the value of Prada goes up you know lvmh doesn't exist without theara and H&M and things like that right um Manhattan doesn't exist without uh the the Bears around it you know so derivative assets when they go up they fundamentally increase the the the value of the the original asset so now you have to when you think about about Ai and replication and replication in the speed of of computers which is what AI is doing and and you have to ask yourself what is if things are going to move so fast these derivative values what are the things that are now going to be exponentially more valuable and I actually think it's like two friends holding hands you know looking at Sunset having coffee like that is the derivative value that that is the original asset sorry that all these derivative assets so I actually think that actually having time with Greg one onone with Greg Eisenberg one one or online but with the real Greg it's going to grow exponentially higher when when the image and replication of Greg 3i is going you know THX and those things need a way to be identified on the internet right so blockchain technology is a way to enumerate and verify things on the Internet is actually a very interesting counterbalance to what AI uh uh the power uh of AI you know and how we as human understand how to navigate between what's real and what's a replication yeah I love it I think I think you're on to something agreed obviously like if there's millions of pieces of content like you know myself right let's just say right now I create 20 pieces of content a week with AI in a year from now I might create 300 400 pieces of content so and we just need to know like who's Greg who's not and and sort of verify that so yeah I think that's where blockchain comes in you've got a lot of ideas on this list and I want to get into some of these ideas that speak to a lot of this stuff and you're giving these away I want to start with um I want to start with the first one the dating the dating idea yeah if you know mine I do not mind okay let's let's let's let's jump in one of the fun things I get to learn as I started you know exploring how models of communication and the idea of of a trust based graph I call it motivational graph but I don't know if it's going to stick but I feel like capturing through blockchain like what the user has done done offchain to onchain is almost like capturing the motivation and we couldn't really capture motivation uh before we just like had people to say like oh I got you know Ben's number therefore I should see him on WhatsApp or I have this person's username therefore I should follow them or like I self-identify as somebody who go to this class in this college so I should be exposed to this uh group of people but it's really becomes interesting where you actually need to do the action in order to to facilitate the relationship so one of the fun things that I've learned is there something called poop which is actually a a way to in person verify that you have been somewhere and I do think that putting like a reputation graph for for dating where and it sounds I think like there's a part of me that's like is just like a revolting against this idea um but I also hear the most insane horror stories you know between people who go on dates and maybe it's just like a a New York thing I don't know but you know we don't have enough accountability I mean and maybe that's the point of this entire part of my journey in my career right now in how I want to you know uh build the the communication well you know World Of Products that I want to see in the world he like we don't have enough accountability and and and owning up to the way we communicate and interact online and this is not to say that we need to punish people for be behaving badly but I actually think we need to reward people for being good stewards of healthy and nuance and mature conversation that that that that holds opinions and is open to to to feedback and to give feedback right I'm I'm I'm recently single after 10 year relationship and I've started to be out there go on dates and and you know some pieces of the puzzle of all these um feedback that that that I'm hearing uh not feedback but I guess like you know your friend your single friends are saying like oh dating so hard and online dating so hard and and and I start to see some of the behaviors that they talk about and you know I have arrived to a conclusion that I think I would have been a better um participant in uh the dating uh Market I guess uh if I had fewer choices that have reputational uh outcome and I think uh the same way to to to other people that I've engaged with and I think that if we can create the kind of um data set that is rewarding people people for being more intentional with the connections that they're making and how it gets uh uh uh manifested in in an actual date and then that goes back onto this open protocol uh and and there are ways to like uh with keeping privacy you can still show different kind of proofs uh of the type of behavior and the type of connections that they're making um I actually think it's it's kind of powerful and I know it sounds super geeky and like dystopian but I'm really coming to that not from the point of like we should be walking around with like a score on our back but more like how do we feel much more uh comfortable knowing that this is going to be a great date this is going to be a good match this is going to be something that's worth my time this is this is going to be something that I do not want to dishonor uh the uh the commitment that I made to you know see this person tonight or whatever and that that I I actually think that as humans we work really well when when there's structure and accountability for the most part even if it's just like self-imposed and and and and I actually think that there is and I might be just like projecting a lot of things here but I think that there's an opportunity here to do to do the same thing to create a a dating in back end if you will with with some sort of a a client that actually allow people to connect get together and leave a sort of footprint with protecting their privacy uh that can then infer and then can then other people who are building clients around it can then infer and use that whether for other you know dating ideas and as the as the backend graph for it or actually for other types of connection that manifest in different ways so is this what you're saying so basically dating kind of sucks right now because people are going on dates and a lot of the dates are low quality people are wasting time they're wasting money it's frustrating for people so you're saying what if we had some sort of scoring system basically that allowed reputation to exist on chain so so that um I guess like both parties or potential parties could trust this source of data and yeah and and just to Nuance this so it's not like I don't think people I think it's so emotionally noted so I don't think people should score other people but what I do think is like if there was no way for you to uh expose uh from privacy everything is hashed and it's just like there technology called Z proof but like let's just say that the user doesn't doesn't see what's happening in the back end and and their privacy is protected but you can tell that based on your previous matches the likelihood for this person to respond in general or in this case is 10% and not 80% the likely what is the likelihood of this person to actually go on a date on the second date on the third date you know this is not we scoring one another but this is just data as it is time to reply time to follow up time to uh uh the likelihood to do a first date and a second date and actually allow local computations on a client based on other proofs to say look Greg here are here are 10 matches like we nobody no human ranked them this is just based on the matches you had before and you went on date and the matches they had before and went on date the likelihood of you going to a second date with this person is 5% and this other person actually if you have a first date then the likelihood of you going to a third datee is 90% where do you start you know and and I think this is not even one another just um given giving some rank ranking to one another this is just here's the data you know and just putting that data uh online I think is is interesting if you can keep you know the Privacy you can protect the privacy of the people and I think you can so dude let me tell you a quick story so literally an hour ago less than an hour ago I got a text from someone we both know okay and she says that her and her boyfriend broke up okay they met on a dating app they met on a dating app and they broke up and she was you know she's obviously super upset about it and like her you know her tldr of the whole thing was uh I have to pick better and prob go a lot slower so yes that's what you're saying right what you're saying is that's what I'm saying yeah what you're saying is when you go on a app today the profile which is essentially curated by the person AKA it's biased by definition um it's biased yes and so there needs to be some and it's okay for it to be biased by the way we're all biased but it wouldn't it be interesting to get the dimension of like based on your matches and their matches and the people that you went on the first date and second date and third date and the people that they went on through app on the first and second date the likelihood of you going to a first date is 10% the likelihood of you breaking up in three months is actually 90% like and and the reason I bring reputation and open protocols to this is because if that's a standard that other dating apps can write into it doesn't matter if you're on hinge on Ria on Tinder or anything right it's just like it's a set it doesn't matter where you profile it's it's just a set that says time to reply time to go on date likely the first second third date on Ser committed relationship broke up you know no scoring just looking at the data based on on on actions you know yeah and and that is I think so cool yeah I also think that I mean you can make some of those some of that data free but you can also make some of it premium data that if you know I want to see Ben's like I would pay so much money to know that information yeah because like you know four dates are costly in New York yeah they're costly also just from like um a mental St time time mental yeah absolutely yeah so absolutely yeah you can do like a tagline like something like you know heartbreak cost an arm and a leg or something like that yeah yeah exactly okay so if you wanted so I I buy the idea that this would be valuable so Ben how hard is it to uh to build something like this and can you give us like a step by step on how you'd build this proof of concept for proof of concept I would start with just a set of smart contracts that is on an on an on an L2 basically on on on it lay layer that is much cheaper on top of ethereum where you can actually create this protocol like just exist on ethereum and without starting a whole new backend infrastructure and I think you can actually P it you can actually POC it like that you will you will have to be somebody who knows how to do an SDK and publish it but I think if you can do if you can build an SDK from uh a toz you know and publish it that and and curiosity around the the the web3 space I would build an SDK that essentially all it does it helps other developer integrate it to the actions that users are doing uh on their clients you know on their Tinder or any other and when an action happen verifiably locally uh your SDK uh gets the kind of confirmation that it need one of the interesting thing is integrating it with Pas keys right you got pasis on the phone you can store locally in the in the local encrypted uh uh drawer of the iPhone that you can only open with your face you can store there the key that allows for the signature for the local action right so you can you can actually almost verify that an action has happened with somebody's face which is kind of cool go and sign that uh uh uh transaction on the back end on uh the the the the that that protocol that you created that is a smart contract and now all of the sudden you have this permissionless open set of encrypted uh uh uh users and like hashed users and hash action uh that uh maybe on the hash action only uh the developers of that implemented have the key to understand what is the action and uh for the hash users only the user have the key to know that this is who they are and um that that way you kind of keep everybody shielded but you also create this great database of action that actually happened locally and uh the likelihood of the second action to happen and and I think that's that's that's great you know that's that's actually something one person can do it's something one person could do and you kind of it's one of those ideas where you don't know where it's going to go in which direction so it's kind of it's kind of fun it is fun cuz like if somebody's selling ads somewhere and they're like wait wait wait can we pay can we pay to know like if somebody saw that ad and we we think like what's the likelihood of them doing something completely random something else somewhere else they will pay also for that kind of information yep so I want to go over two more ideas today um the next idea I want to go over is the watch Marketplace idea and then I want to end with the teaching and tutoring business idea um the watch Marketplace idea do you watch like watch talk like with all these influencers do you want just be honest with me I don't because I'm trying to protect myself okay well it's too it's too I'm a big I'm a big Cartier Santos guy I'm a big like I love the I there's a specific type of watch that the story and everything around it I like I'm I'm very fascinated about it and the history of it and I own three of them of those and every time you know every time I buy one I'm like [ __ ] yeah you know and so I'm trying to I'm trying to take it slow so so I mean you're talking to a guy who's wearing no watch and uh a $44.50 Kirkland t-shirt so I get it but I for whatever reason on my Tik Tok feed I get a lot of these luxury watch people trading un because you're lookalike probably the lookalike based on the no look like on the graph no for sure like like yeah so I there is a situation some of some people probably even know the situation where there's these two guys on watch talk there's this guy named vkim who has like millions of followers or something and then there's this guy named Manny okay now vuk and and his partner um what the hell is his name Buckley okay these guys are like the kings of watch talk and Manny is is now like accusing Buckley of just being like you know he's out there selling you know saying he's selling $100,000 roxes but this is like a what does he call him he calls him a battery repair man all he knows is to repair battery who is this guy and then and then you have Buckley creating videos being like Manny they're selling watches with batteries that's not real watches well that's that's Manny's point right Manny's point and and maybe we could include one of the videos uh so people could see it but the point is there's a a lack of trust like both of them are trying to create absolutely a lack of trust in the luxury Marketplace so tell me I just want to set the to set the stage with that tell me about your watch Marketplace idea and why trust is really important in in the space what one of the thesis behind the the the protocol and the and the the client that that we're building or the protocol that we're building called River and um the idea is to create an endtoend encrypted social um messaging protocol that is um essentially built on the graph of trust or the of motivation uh and the bet is that the more there is offchain thing proofs that are going onchain the more we can validate online uh in a way that is open and uh uh trust less I guess uh that somebody did the actions that they said they did the more that we creating a new graph that is around motivation and alignment of interest of what we stand to gain and lose and that warrants a new type of uh communication product that is not organized around I'm a watch uh salesman I sold a lot of watches and you're like I'm a watch buyer I bought a lot of watches therefore we should all come to this form and engage which is not a good idea because one of you is going to lose their pens right um so in the kind of work that we're doing now which is to build this kind of digital spaces of communities that are permissionless and people can come and trust that the right people are in the right place and other the the wrong people are not in the in the in the in the place um it it provokes the imagination of what kind of community uh that is permissionless that everybody can join is organized around the idea of trust between sellers and buyers specifically of luxury goods that have an enumerated or like a um an identifying uh uh ID in that case you think about luxury watches each of them have uh and even even Prada today have rfids on all the clothes right you can actually scan those things uh I've been playing around have you ever seen this thing called flipper no what is it is this thing recorded like with a video can I can bring it here show yeah yeah well basically flipper is a per Poise it's a per Poise this is this s some people use it for uh nefarious stuff but it can scan all of those RFID stuff you know RFC RFID all of those and it can scan it and then replay it so you can actually um you can go to my fob of my elevator and copy it and replay it on that and write it somewhere but what's interesting with this and those readers is like you know you can basically verify that this is the because prodct shirts have now rfids right and um some watches have have rfids you know those things don't need batteries um and there's no way for you to read that signal without without like you have to be next to it to read that signal so that means that you can create the type of backend that verify that somebody has a certain watch next to them not only this you can enforce the existence of this item as a as something called as as as a basically call it like an nftd I'm sorry for I know that world that word has a lot of bad baggage but just think about it as as a piece on the internet that is tied with that item that cannot be replicated and for sure in a mathematical way you can prove that this is the one and you say hey like in order for me to buy it from you this is going to go to an escrow that also exists in a permissionless way with my money in a permissionless way when I get it the only way for me to get it is when I get it in my hand the only way to secure my reputation is to release the funds from the escrow to the seller and receive that that NFD sorry again for the for that word but like we release that that Digital Image right no because I feel like digital image that is verifiable to me and in that way I have um didn't lose any of my reputation as a buyer and the seller didn't lose any of the reputation of uh the seller not only this maybe we can both uh uh rank one another right and how good was the just thumbs up thumbs down how good was the experience right then all of the sudden you start getting this uh uh publicly available and permissionless and secure database of who has what watches it includes also the transactions of the uh the money itself so it's highly highly cost prohibitive to betray it right to be a bad actor on it and now instead of going through you know a million different forums and blogs and try to verify who is who and what's what and I'm hearing you know there's like horror stories where like some some of those not horror stories but like some of the uh uh people who sell online have great reputation in a specific site and some have in another site but they not share the same inventory so one will post on behalf of the other in their inventory to increase you know it's kind of a collab you know and you kind of you don't control that right but it also open another Avenue where like you wanna you have you have a watch that you want to sell to me like somebody but you don't know who they are and what it is okay show me show me your your your show me that watches like uh you know nft and then you can see like okay who owns it it's you what's the what's the credit what's the reputation you know and you can actually feel relatively secure to do this transaction without the because right now all these all these marketplaces they take Arbitrage to create the illusion of trust right so they take their 20% or 10% of the transaction because they are you know Chrono or other places where people buy buy watches but if you can ver ify that a watch and a seller are in good condition and the seller is a good seller and the watch is in a good condition and there is a good layer of trust there then you can actually maybe make the market a little bit more efficient and remove the third party that I you know so that's that's essentially the idea and then all of the sudden when you tie to like the work we do with with river and like you can actually put the most interesting watch owners that probably have those interesting watches together in group chat you know people give just them right entitlement so they can trade with one another they know who the other person just for people in listening like how how can they okay so let's say someone wants to go and build this this this watch Marketplace idea take uh you know the The Vig I think as it's called or or the the commission from or or or percentage from 15% from 15% to like a dollar a transaction how do they go okay they they build this they build it in a month now they want to make it more interesting with river what does what does that mean so so the the fun thing is that you don't they don't need to do a lot with with River so I I'll explain um what the way you should think people should think about when I say River you should think about it as imagine if WhatsApp was an the the back end of WhatsApp was an open protocol that is owned and operated by the groups so anyone can build clients on it anyone can maintain it anyone can build uh can improve it and and operate it that means you you know you me anyone not not not just us the build the Builders of the port if somebody wanted to create the the a a community of of of of a community a permissionless community where the people who have the most interesting watches can trade them and have reputation and they they they take maybe certain amount of of uh fee just to facilitate it what I would do I would do there's just one thing that they should do is create the smart contract that uh people can interact with and use the uh unique identifier of the luxury item to uh uh uh get receive from the smart contract uh the uh uh digital representation in the form of NFD that that uh that gives that that that basically says this person actually secured here in an encrypted way secured here uh the the all the information that's needed for some uh as an owner for this Rolex let's say you just do it for Rolex or something like that okay cool now you have this smart contract that produce signatures for it's still prone to mistakes because it's uh self attest however because it's a two-sided Market people can give each other reputation which means that accountability will happen you know if if if you're assuming that people are going to use it right um like I'm saying I actually I actually have this watch then for me to receive the money from you as the buyer it actually goes through the smart contract and released you know uh uh uh only after you verified that you got the watch and and I and and I received the the digital signature okay great now that you have that uh you can you can say now that you have before you did the sale that you have that digital signature that proves that you have the uh luxury watch you can create a town you can use the river has a as a as a client called towns which is basically uh you can think about it like a a Discord and slack had a baby and and this is a way of as the Builders of the protocol to uh create like um a business card for the protocol and show people what they can do and you would create a town that says only allow people that have this uh uh uh uh that have the digital signature of the that verified that they have you know that they s attested that they have uh the luxury watch in and only give them uh um a right access into into the group and the way it looks like is that if if you have a big Community or like you have some followers or you know people who have some followers that are in the watch Community they will publish a link to the town the town is available to anyone to come in if they own a Rolex how do they do that you go to the smart contract that you that you wrote as a builder you put all the information as an owner to receive the uh digital signature the nft and then that gives you the permission to actually enter enter the group chat so you don't need to build a lot you just need to build the smart contract that takes the uh information that a Rolex owner would have only the owner would have you know and uh uh do the kind of computation needed to create the signature that is then stored encrypted and sent to you uh the NFD with with that with that uh with that item now I wish I wish the watch companies themselves did it I think it works even better with the RFID stuff like things like Prada and other stuff but I think it's a great start because then I I feel like somebody as a watch owner I would go open the box write all the details on on your on your website you know receive the nftd and that will give me an Access to uh the group chat and now the group chat is like you know bunch of people that you can you know what they own you know you know that they have those those things and I think that's pretty cool and that's a great start yeah so I W to I want to synthesize a little bit what you said for people so yeah I rambled a little bit there no this is what this is what it's why I'm here so because I I think what you're saying is really smart the way vuk and Buckley built their business was they built an audience up top on Tik Tok and Instagram then they created a paid Community called vkm verified where you have to pay $20 a month and other Watch dealers and watch buyers can buy and sell from each other but there's no real trust besides for the fact that you have to have a credit card that can spend $20 a month what you're saying uh I mean you can still build the audience on these platforms build the audiences on these platforms but create um you know and focus on areas where there's it's kind of there's not so much trust like in the watch industry but basically create a trust layer between both parties and once the trust layer exists then it's almost like someone gets a badge that allows them to enter to the community as like hey I'm I'm I'm not just just you know there's a difference between okay I went to a concert last night and I this is not a flex but I was backstage and you know anyone could buy notag okay not I I didn't say what what concert it could have been like you know my cousin's uh ukulele yeah recital so let's let's let's keep it at that but you know the idea was anyone could anyone could buy a ticket to the show but not anyone can get backstage pack passes what you're saying is by virtue of this verified trust layer you actually get the backstage passes and the exhaust so to speak from the the um trust is the ability to have this social layer that's that's what you're saying yes and and even if you take it further you can even say like hey if you already bought a Rolex and you have the details of the Rolex you get in free it's the people that are curious or people who couldn't prove that they already from an EOS perspective believe in the value of watch like yeah they don't have a luxury watch because they didn't do this proof they should they are the one that should be paying 20 bucks to be part of and if you have a watch to sell you just make the proof and come on in and you if you have not if you don't have then put your money where your muet you know like cool okay we have time for one last Quick startup idea teacher tutoring businesses I think it's very similar so it's basically a manifestation of the of what we talked about explain explain what you're thinking here you know it's actually a combo of the two previous idea the dating and because it is teaching is such a it's like a one-on-one relationship or one to few right and there is something about the likelihood of an action for you to go to the second class and the and the first class in the second class like how consistent you are uh with um with a teacher uh which is kind of similar right to what we talked about with the reputation with dating like arguably without attesting to the quality of Greg you as a person or your your partner as a person I can just say you know that if I had a way to observe how much how many days how many unique days you're spending time in person and just say what's the streak and how long it's been consistent I if I had this database database on all the uh relationship in the world I will probably just by that can infer what are good relationships and what are not what are ones that are people people um continue to engage it and you're right it's not going to capture all the codependency relationship and the weird ones stuff but it it will speak to some form of quality that keeps both people engaged and my point is that we don't know who's a good teacher and who's a bad teacher but if we could know if we if we could know that like look according to students that look like you and teachers that look like this person that you're considering there is high likelihood that you're going to retain in this class just by observing recurrency therefore you know this is a good match and I I wrote it here because you know there there's a lot of of of of of people that have desired to receive feedback and be coached and there's a lot of people that uh feel qualified to do that and a lot of people that are qualified to do that right it's not our business to judge or decide for them but I think there is a huge gap in which how do you know which one is for you and how they're going to get the best out of you and I think just like just if you if you just uh uh implement the same thought that we had with the dating but to recurrence of going to somebody's class you can you can effectively uh um do this for coaches and for the topics in the teacher so I think that's that's interesting this is way yeah well I think so and the way it's like combo with with the luxury stuff is like you can do the same thing where there is like uh you put the money through the smart contract you you sa it after you watch after you saw after you had the class then there is some reputational aspect and that kind of like it's the combo of like the the goods and and the repetition education and coaching are fundamentally retention businesses your goal is you want the person also relationships and relationships yeah for sure it's relationships and it's retention it's those two things it's it's you know I can even I'm just thinking about like in high school and Elementary School like some of the teachers that made a meaningful impact on my life and it was a mix of like who they were as people how they were able to communicate but also they were just really good at getting me to retain information um and and stories and stuff like that so what you're saying is is interesting because you're saying like oh with something like this this is going to help like you're kind of gamifying the experience in some way where there's like levels and almost leaderboards um and in some ways right because you're like couldn't couldn't you use this technology to do that and in in which case the outcome is like a high more retentive student for sure and I and I think what what I'm trying to get here what I'm trying to get at is a lot of bad tutoring is the actual the relationship the fit between the teacher and the student right so now you what you have what we have now because we don't have a way to judge that reputation of the fit because there's no shared open databases that people can make you know uh those products can make decisions or help users make decisions because of that you have an inefficient Market where the most excellent teachers in the world who by definition capture a lot of students because they're the the top of the top now they have much more beaters on their time and the price go up because they have but the argument here is that instead of Greg going to Tony Robbins and get like you know wal class oneon-one coaching because Tony Robbins you know is you know considered world class my curiosity is this is because Tony Robins regardless of his relationship with with Greg is a you know number one in his field let's call it like this just for the sake of the example the outcome that Greg is getting from having a teacher that is relationship agnostic But the teacher is number one in in the in the in in his in his in in the world I'm curious about that outcome if I gave you a a teacher that is half as good as Tony Robbins but is world class fit to you yes totally and and that's what I'm trying to say is that we have because we don't have time to to to take surfing lessons yeah from a thousand teachers to find the one that is great from us now the best surfing teachers in that area are getting their prices jacked out because normally a lot of beaters on the this time will just beat more to get in line right but what if we can we can put you in touch with the person that you have higher likelihood to to succeed with even though they might be less of a great teacher as the other person yes you know that that's the inefficiency that I put it's the same way with with dating I think this is honestly my favorite idea of all of them because it it just it's it's it drives the most amount of impact and it feels like relatively simple to create something to get to proof of concept it I want to summarize our entire conversation in four steps so this is what I've learned this is what I've learned from this conversation how to create a product people want number one one find inefficient markets number number two add a trust layer number three build social and number four don't necessarily say it's crypto I mean you talked you said the word nft before but it doesn't matter right you don't have to expose doesn't matter guys it doesn't matter and it's it's it's it's it's a shame that um I almost need to feel embarrassed when I speak to people who are not when I speak to an audience that is not necessarily because you know a lot of the because there's so much good in it the idea that the internet was built so fast was built so fast and with the idea that people wouldn't pay for it and now we have groups of people online that are creating value every day and because because the Inception of the internet was from the state of mind that oh people won't pay for it the people who create this insane value on the internet they work two times harder to repackage some of the attention that they're getting and selling it in some inefficient way where they need to prove that they they're worthy of your your your credit card and stuff and and and I think that that must have been the way we needed the internet to start in order to get a lot of people on board but it is a time for us to say the internet need to be accessible for everyone but it shouldn't be necessarily free there are people who are honest people who are doing day-to-day uh you know work on the internet to bring value to their community and their job is just you know it's it's not as rewarding as it should be it's tankless it's exhausting you know and they need to almost like hustle to just be rewarded for the kind of value that they're bringing in and you know crypto not crypto blockchain is a fantastic solution to the idea of how do you enumerate value on the internet and Trust for it in a way that is just by science a trustworthy and I think that that ultimately benefits the receiver of the value that you're creating online and you in a in in in an open Market that people can in transparent way acknowledge each other's value and trust and that's that's the layer that we're missing on the on the internet to take it to to a to a place where um acrel value by individual is much more transparent and efficient and the products we're getting for people are better because there is accountability because when you make money you want to make the product better you want to retain your customers you want to make sure that they're happy you want to make sure they're coming back you want to make sure they get a V2 and a V3 and a V4 and you are much why because when you do that you make more money you know so that's that's that's my uh romance with blockchain and social now day and why why why why I'm I'm infatuated with with that as a as a medium to work in right now beautiful Ben where could people find more about you and building on top of the river protocol um you uh on me um it's at Ben rbn uh on on Twitter um the river protocol is river. built you can go and look what the protocol there's the AL the documentation there uh if you're just curious about like oh how can I create simple you know uh reputation smart contracts which is I feel like the the idea with with with been talking about like that that thing is literally a hackaton thing to do the thing that we talked about with the with uh um with the teachers right and then you can just go on towns tos.com which is the the the client that we built for for River and anyone can build a client for River actually and if you created that smart contract on reputation you can create a town that is gating by that reputation and all of the sudden uh uh now you have uh uh a social place for people who did the action uh and have that kind of reputation of teachers and tutor and and students to have a place to come together and discuss and knowing that you know uh they're talking to the right teachers and the students are talking to the the student talking to the right teachers and teachers talking to the right students and um also um to the monologue that I had right before that about value Corel uh space creators on towns they have ways to uh uh uh charge for that in a way that is transparent and on onchain you can just say like hey this space is uh cost certain amount of money a year or for whatever you set it and um that's also going to benefit you as a builder and a community facilitator if you choose to do that so you got River protocol you got towns and yeah yeah I think uh if this res if if what Ben was saying resonate with you at all and you're like that's kind of interesting I came into this maybe skeptical and now you know less skeptical I think uh I always like to get my hands dirty and and just try different things that's why you know when it comes to AI tools I'm always just like hey go and go and play with it try to build something um if anyone you know if you're interested in web 3 like this is a great place to experiment um LCA our Innovation agency actually built something on top of the uh River protocol and it was an absolute blast called propeller do chat and you learn from you learn from this you literally learn from this and it's fun it's it's a lot of fun so it is and there's gonna be some people who listen to this are going to be like you know what like this this doesn't speak to me this doesn't speak to me but there are going to be people listen to this are going to be like wow you know if I could you know add efficiencies to the billion dooll watch Market or um you know I'm really into you know this one tutor in school like made such a big difference in my life and if I could give that same experience to you know thousands of people in the world like I I want to dedicate some time I want to dedicate you know three weeks of time to hack on something so thanks for coming on and uh appreciate you thank you Greg it was a pleasure later [Music]

if you don't know what a faist YouTube channel is it's a YouTube channel where there's no Creator you don't see any person and it's somebody doing a voiceover and what's interesting about these I didn't know these were basically businesses and they're just pumping out this content what most people are doing and what most what people are missing on faceless channels is they're not picking these nich they're not really picking niches they're just like how do I get as much views as possible so I can monetize via ads whereas the move is to be like what is the most high impact Niche to go after and then how do I create faceless content for that Niche so if you want to do this here's how I would do it using mostly AI [Music] tools all right Jonathan ja cream Courtney you're back back I can't get rid of you you're like the gecko of the startup ideas podcast I always come back um yeah you know I've been watching the episodes of this podcast that do well and uh you've also been messaging me and generally people just want ideas and as the name of the podcast is called a podcast podcast podcast ideas podcast um like what seems to do pretty well is like things that one person can do um that can make potentially a lot of money and isn't like doesn't require a whole team to set up that seems to be the vibe right I think so I think uh a lot of people listening to this probably have jobs and they just kind of want to set up something on the side and then maybe it turns into something like super big and maybe it doesn't need to I mean it it could just be like making $100,000 a year or whatever it is on the side and it's like great you know and you can sell that you're making $100,000 a year and you can sell that at five times ARR if you want so I I ran with that and I found one or two things that I think could be pretty interesting uh one again like a lot of the things that I find are not because I'm researching for this podcast it's because I'm researching it for myself um and one of the things that you know I have a YouTube channel our YouTube channel is one of the best ways for us to get qualified leads for our business but I'm always looking to like what else can you do at YouTube and I stumbled across this notion board and I sent it to you it's called six figure channel list and it's a notion board full of different channels on YouTube um and they're kind of ordered by sixf figure channels and seven figure channels and the idea here or what's special about these channels is that they're called faceless YouTube channels and I want to give credit to faceless Channel account academy.com uh actually it was a guy who's the guy he even he looks like Cody Schneider a little bit uh you want to give credit to Cody Schneider I want to give credit to Cody Schneider even though it isn't him it's like uh the video whatever the guy who runs the business faceless Channel we put it in we'll link it we'll link it whatever his name is um so I came across his video then uh he had this whole notion board and by the way I'll give you my first first impression of faceless YouTube channels if you don't know what a faceless YouTube channel is it's a YouTube channel where there's no Creator you don't see any person and it's somebody doing a voiceover the most famous ones that you know are daily dose of Internet everyone hello this is your what is it hello welcome to your daily dose of Internet that guy you know that guy that was actually pretty good what does he say is it that it's basically that I mean you you you got it welcome your daily dose of Internet uh so that then there's quartz gazak the I think German Channel which does animations and then there's a ton of [ __ ] absolute dog [ __ ] uh out there but in between a there's also like some like interesting ones like Charisma on command um you've seen tons of them if you go to this notion board I don't know if you'll share it uh you're going to notice a lot of these and what's interesting about these I never even paid attention I didn't even know what these things were were and I am obsessed with YouTube I didn't know these were basically businesses where people are using people from Fiverr to write scripts AI to write scripts narrators from Fiverr so it's not even the same person narrating all the time um and they're just pumping out this content Charisma on uh command is a very good example not necessarily saying this person is using AI or anything but it's just like okay here's a thing that people want to know about Charisma and human interaction here's a celebrity interaction that we can break down and I'm going to narrate this celebrity interaction and it gets unbelievable amounts of views and of course then it makes money uh Charisma and command in particular makes seven figures apparently per year but there's a lot of other very Niche things in there um like for example Survival how to survive um yeah there's just so many different things in there it's really interesting history seems to be a big thing like uh you know talk about the black plague or I just watched one about the white death which is tuberculosis um there's daily dose of football there's so many different things there's body cam channels you've probably come across them but you might not have realized that they're part of this movement on YouTube called faceless YouTube channels now why I find this interesting again there's tons of crap out there and I don't like the idea of polluting YouTube with absolute dog [ __ ] like crappy stupid AI generated scripts that are useless but a couple of these are actually interesting to watch a couple of these are entertaining couple of these are actually kind of cool and those are the ones that stand out and those are the ones that get the most views and what I love about it is I really think a lot of people would love to make content so for example I'd love to make some video game content but I don't personally want to be in the content like I don't want to be you know trolled I don't like actually to be a personality on the internet I do it almost as like a a necessity basically like because making content is a cool way to get clients and and to sell products but I love the idea of being able to make channels that are purely based on you know other footage maybe animation um maybe just taking interviews from other people and commenting on them and I've been spending the last four or five days looking at these channels and thinking how can I apply this to myself and yeah I think there's a way to to Wade through the absolute [ __ ] of the 90% of these channels and make actually good versions of them so yeah that's my first idea is is looking into this idea of faceless YouTube channels and now that I've started going into the down the rabbit hole my entire YouTube recommendations is full of different content creators talking about how to make face faceless YouTube channels um so it's a super yeah super interesting concept didn't know about it well that's because the like the DTC bro is now the faceless YouTube Bro who was previously the crypto bro right so like the next this is like the next Gold Rush and quick ad break let me tell you about a business I invested in it's called boring marketing.com so a few years ago I met this group of people that were some of the best Co experts in the world they were behind getting some of the biggest companies found on Google and the secret sauce is they've got a set of technology and AI that could help you outrank your competition so for my own businesses I wanted that I didn't want to have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I didn't want to depend on ads to drive customers to my businesses I wanted to rank high in Google that's why I like SEO and that's why I use boring marketing.com and that's why I invested in it they're so confident in their approach that they offer a 30-day Sprint with 100% money back guarantee who does that nowadays so check it out highly recommend boring marketing.com you know when I say that a lot of people are going to listen to this and they're going to be like oh I don't want to be I don't want to be a DTC bro or whatever um but to your point there's there's like a small subset of people who are doing faceless channels like like so right and actually adding value to the internet that you know this is just one of the it's just one of the best ways to build an audience right now like just point blank it's so cool yeah and again like I see the dtoc Bro kind of thing and I'm not interested in being that um but for example I've always wanted to start a video game channel again I want to do this Nostalgia hacking thing I want to talk about Halo I want to talk about jetset radio I want to talk about the Dreamcast I want to talk about shenmo but I've always been what's really held me back is being a personality is like people are people get very attached to internet personalities and and get very weird about that I have no interest in that and now that I've learned about this faceless YouTube channel thing and found a couple of gaming faceless channels I'm like yeah this would actually be a viable root for me to build a media Empire around nostalgic gaming with without having to be the face of it maybe not even having to be the voice of it just writing the scripts and coming up with the concepts and having someone else voice it I honestly just never thought about it but it's so obvious now so here's what I think people are missing with faceless video channels is like traditional media they're monetizing it basically only with ads so a lot of these people are just okay I'm going to throw up a faceless YouTube channel I'm going to clip uh or or you know a lot of people are doing by the way I don't know if you've seen this it's on my it's all over my Tik Tok feed they're taking uh Joe Rogan's voice and just telling interesting stories with Joe Rogan's Voice have you seen this using like an AI Joe Rogan's voice yes so yeah yeah I've heard that yeah so quick quick story on this so every every night when I want to chill out and numb my brain a little bit your boy your boy goes to Tik Tok okay your boy goes to Tik Tok and I'm noticing that 10% of my feed is these Joe Rogan telling these such interesting stories about like stuff that I would never expect Joe Rogan to talk about like how Dolphins were you know essentially aliens and just the craziest stuff and it's entertaining I'm not saying I believe that dolphins you know are I I'm not saying I believe that you know dolphins are you know smarter than human beings and like colonized you know the planet and stuff like that anyways point is I'm getting these videos left right in center and I'm like at a certain point I was like there's no way that Joe Rogan said this there's just absolutely zero chance that he's saying like thousands of these stories and turns out it's a faceless Tik Tok YouTube channel not I I don't remember the name and people like that are making you know 10 to 100K a month on these channels yeah but I think the move is not to do not to do it with ads it's to build your own products like I talk about always the ACP funnel right build an audience then convert to a community and then build a product for them what most people are doing and what most what people are missing on faceless channels is they're not picking these nich they're not really picking niches they're just like how do I get as much views as possible so I can monetize via ads whereas the move is to be like what is the most high impact Niche to go after and then how do I create faceless content for that Niche and there's some really interesting uh faceless channels that I've come across as well this week I came across a channel I don't know if you know it called wormwood um and they're doing something like what you were just talking about except in the Art Space it's like a absurdest art project thing almost uh bjo is the one that I just laugh my ass off it's a video that has 285,000 views the AI the voice is AI um I do think the script is a mixture of AI and and written by the person I don't know anything about this person but the everything about it is just like mindbending and super interesting and super cool uh and I did again when I was looking at these things I was like yeah I would never have put the label you know we on this podcast me and you now are saying that this thing is called a faceless YouTube channel the general public doesn't know anything about this stuff I didn't know about it until like a couple of days ago and I think there again I don't think you should be joining the Bros on a race to the bottom I think that if you're if you have interest in Concepts and especially if you can write which is like a crazy thing if you can write right then you can make a YouTube channel now because more and more people are expecting to not have to see the person who's actually talking so I think writer writers are going to have a killer Advantage here um the people who don't have to use AI to to create to generate the scripts um but if you just have like great Concepts and interesting ideas take a look at that wormwood Channel take a look at the bjo video it's hilarious it's really funny it's really cool and it's totally demented and insane and it's in a completely different direction it couldn't be less like the Crypt bro guys you're talking about it's a completely different world so if you want to do this here's how I would do it using mostly AI tools so step one is you got to come up with ideas you need a script and you want to optimize your script I would probably use a mixture of chat GPT Cloe um I'd probably use a tool like gummy search um which I'm actually gonna create a whole yeah I'm gonna create I'm actually gonna create a whole separate video on how to mine for gold on Reddit and and some of these platforms so I've never found this be I've never seen this before yeah yeah it's really really key it's really cool I use it every day actually so I'm gonna I'll do um I'll do a whole video on that but I would use that to basically see like in different subreddits what is being you know what's popular what are people talking about um and then yeah I would use chat GPT and Cloe to create that script you could also use Fiverr uh to to supplement it step two is you need to create the images um so you know before you know if you want to create a viral YouTube video It's All About title and thumbnail so you you want to optimize for the image so I'd probably use di 2 or something like that for the image generation step three is you're going to have to create the video so there's a bunch of tools like this there's um uh nid AI um there's a new one called let me pull it up it's called crayo c r a yo cray. aai I'm looking at this now uh these are like faceless YouTube guys who created this why is all why are all uh AI websites purple is that just me or are all of them purple I'm not saying it's bad I'm just saying why is everything purple I don't know man but I don't like everything purple go one bit so the you know these guys I haven't used their product so I can't vouch for it but um it's purple so it's good exactly then you want to use 11 labs for uh AI voiceovers so you just put in the script uh you get you get uh the voice over um then using something like vid IQ for um which is a Chrome extension for keyword research and channel optimization um you can also use Mr Beast has a new one called view stats views.com so and there you have it in a box um but I think what's missing from here is you got to pick a niche that's high value and because it's not just about the views it's about conver those views into products and services and communities should we do should we do um almost like like you know what I'd love to do actually at some time uh would be a video maybe this could be online or it could be live or whatever it is but I'd love to do a video with you where we start on a Friday and the we have to make x amount of dollars by like 72 hours later or we explode or or we are just like like absolutely shitty entrepreneurs but I'd love to do I'd love to also watch videos like that I see people posting oh like I helped a guy make blah blah blah in 72 hours but whenever I watch the video they don't actually make money they always just like ask their friends to give the money but i' I'd want to have a video me and you where we actually try an idea like this and the idea would be to make $10,000 from strangers and it has to also not fall apart like the second the video ends you know it should run for a little bit but just to prove the prove the point so you would so I I don't know most of these tools and that's a different so the cool thing about this is like for me the idea and the the concept part would be super exciting the actual execution that's where I would want to have the actual execution and someone going in and doing these things that's where I would probably pull someone from Fiverr uh to actually pull these tools together and give me the end result how long do you think it would take from the idea to having a video on YouTube less than 72 hours seriously yeah yeah I think I mean dude 72 hours is conservative like 7.2 hours is realistic but just giving extra time I think 72 hours like the hardest part is going to be picking a niche that doesn't have a ton of competition that you think could stand out that you think can go that you think can go viral uh I mean writing a script is really not hard and and I mean with Fiverr if you want to use Fiverr like okay that just extends your time 24 hours probably um but all the other tools like they're quick yeah I think the so and choosing the niche you would use this Gummy Search for it or like would you have a product in mind first that you would want to have at the end of the niche like for example I don't know this brick we talked about it the brick that bricks your phone having a Channel all about digital detox and would you start with the product in mind or start with the nichan mind no I always start with the nichan mind like the audience and I'm always like okay what's a lifestyle I I generally prefer targeting Lifestyles because there's like stronger there's a stronger Community with a lifestyle than just like a random audience so I usually start with that and I always try to look at like what's a what's a new interesting lifestyle and like for example with with the brick one it's like there's this whole generation of people who are like anti phones they're buying like dumb phones um and it's starting to get it's starting you just start to see it like the posts that are going viral are like I left my phone and one for a walk and you know and then I see who replies I'm like that's a dumb post like and then I see who replies to it and it's jream on Twitter this is oh my God I never thought about taking a walk without my phone dude I I do get I know what I do get that phone anxiety when I go climbing like bouldering I leave my phone in in like a locker and I this sounds really weird either so I used to I was taking my Apple watch with me so that if somebody calls me they can get through to my Apple watch now I don't but I basically tell everyone hey call this climbing Hall if you need me and then I feel Cal but yeah there there is something brain damaging about getting obsessed obsessive about always being contactable I even got a dumb phone for my uh apartment so that everybody who knows me can get through to me if my iPhone is just like somewhere in the apartment where I can't find it so I feel more calm it's it's a it's a problem I just I just feel bad for the receptionist at the climbing place that's that's what I feel no one's ever called obviously yeah they're like hey uh can you find a tall skinny guy with glasses literally every other climber looks like yeah yeah exactly yeah I'm gonna do yeah but but totally separate uh totally separate topic so you would start with a lifestyle so like how you would write this out is I'm targeting people who do this thing or people people who are interested in this thing how like how would you phrase it I would say I'm targeting people of the XYZ community soing community of the climbing community of the anti smartphone community of the you know keto diet diet Community yeah I think those are the strongest and those on social just do the best because people people people see that content and you know half the people or more than half the people are like this doesn't pertain to me but the people who are into keto are like really into keto and then once you you know what once you you you build this faceless YouTube channel or it could be on other platforms too could be on Instagram whatever once you have that audience and now you're like one of the de facto places where that Community is getting content then that's when you can build like a set of products and services for that for that audience and and the reason like I love starting at audience first is now you understand that audience better than anyone because when you're optimizing scripts and you're optimizing titles and you're optimizing thumbnails and the difference between you know one word is that difference if your video Pops that day or goes nowhere and that's like the YouTube algorithm like I've had videos that just changing a word to a number is the difference between you know 40,000 views and 400 views and that's just the reality that's just the reality and especially if you're relying on this on for income if that's the difference between $40 a day or $4 a day sorry and $400 a day or $4,000 a day like you're going to pay attention to what this audience uh clicks and it's not just like the clickbait it's also the retention what is going to retain these people so that's why I think doing a faceless channel in a particular Niche great way to get started if you want to start a business there's another Niche that I find really interesting so obviously I'm very into the video game Niche I just want to give you another example just to also show you that they're not all the Bros if you go to the channel and again I don't know anything about these people they might they might have videos that are like inappropriate or something I don't know but zoke z v o k he's like an Elden ring lore content Channel faceless again um and dude I watch this channel like and now I'm also realizing I watch a lot of faceless channels especially around specific niches nichas like I mean video gaming is an entire Niche but elen ring is a niche by itself yes which is big enough for most individuals to take care of just one video game oh 100% do you feel now that you know how the sausage is made are you embarrassed to watch faceless video um something has happened in my brain where I'm like I now I'm kind of now it all makes sense I guess but I I personally so for me I think the faceless videos that are acceptable are when the person really writes the script themselves when it's content that they're not stealing from other people where they're actually coming up with their own interpretation of the thing like when someone's talking about Elden ring lore and of course they're reading through the wikis and they're reading through the lore in the game but they're giving their own take on it I'm I'm not a fan of the purely AI generated voices and scripts that people just using to pump out as much revenue as possible um but yeah like the the channels that I watch at I wouldn't have labeled them as faceless YouTube channels I wasn't even thinking about it yeah to you it's YouTube channels watch yeah I wasn't thinking about this I didn't know about this Niche at all right and I think that's the Hallmark of a great video right I think like if you're creating faceless you you know YouTube content for example just create great YouTube content exactly yeah I mean the faceless thing is like I I I went to my my girlfriend's YouTube like on her TV I opened up YouTube and like the almost every video that's recommend to her recommended to her she likes you know she's into personal development learning about Consciousness all of that kind of stuff and I was like Wow every one of these thumbnails is AI generated and when I click into it it's always like some very distant voice oh my God I found a really good one as well um this sorry I mean I don't know how your team wants to edit this but I want to show you an example of an amazing one it has minimal personality but really great kind of infographics even though very very simple um it's the guy he does like one video a year I don't know if you know he he did this Pentagon um puzzle thing this is it cracking the uncrackable code what's it called Jim sandborn I'm just realizing now that this is a faceless oh yeah the channel is called lamino l m m i n o check that channel out so this is the this is like the definition of a good faceless YouTube channel and he did a I recently watched this one called cryp the unbreakable cryptos code has 4.1 million views Kennedy assassin assassinations 11 million views his videos are great I would never have put like a generic stamp on it saying oh yeah this is just some crap to make money um and he's I guess making money with a combination of patreon and YouTube but yeah that's so lame that is so lame right like when I that's the thing with faceless YouTube channels is they all are making money on patreon and AD I don't know if it's [Music] lame I mean it's still like I know your audience is here to make millions but if I was making like 25k a month from being able to make like videos that I think people will enjoy I would be okay with that like I would I would be okay with having it as like if you're saying especially some people are still working at a company having like a side hustle like that I think is pretty cool but of course I also didn't know about this until this week so you're so much more integrated into it and the product approach is probably more but like if you're not good at selling stuff it's not about selling stuff would it be the amount of work here's my take Pro here's my take hit me hit me I'm I'm about to hit you you don't even know what's coming right now okay all right the amount of work it takes to create a faceless YouTube channel in a lower quality Niche and a faceless YouTube channel with a higher quality Niche that has the potential to extend beyond ads to create something really simple I'm talking about you're selling a PDF you know on gumroad um you're creating a paid community on school you're like I'm talking you know you're creating a pretty simple SAS app um like these are things that you es especially now the tools are so easy and there's Global Talent I just figure if I'm going to build any faceless YouTube channel I much rather it be the latter not the former oh my God inter historian is also a faceless YouTube channel that's true by the way you know it also is a faceless YouTube channel literally like every animation channel the infographic show do you know that one no but that's on the list actually so they've got 14.3 million subscribers so we're talking this is a top YouTube channel like period holy crap yeah and they create a video every day I'm almost certain that they use AI sorry sorry they do these so I'll just I'll read you some of their videos like their latest video is how your pet is trying to warn you that you are going to die and it's a 4 hour and six minute video so these guys are these people are creating long videos animation AI enh enhance you know you know what I bet you on a video like that just on ad Revenue they are making you know 10 grand 15 grand easy because how long it is they're just taking also world events like here's what happens to your body while you're having sex uh here's how the Seal team took down Osama Bin Laden minute by minute um how they caught Ted Bundy what happens when you die which is a seven minute video which has 26 million ion views the worst punishment in the history of mankind the worst torture what happens to your body when you smoke weed evil punishments designed to be worse than death I do want to watch that actually um oh yeah America's strangest serial killer man could two people repopulate the earth I guess you're just looking at also quora questions that get a lot of yes eat and just making a video of it it totally I think that's that's the secret that no one's talking about is if you look on social Kora Reddit Tik Tok even other YouTube videos you see which videos are being validated so if you could basically create faceless versions of them them but also add value you're not going to like don't don't go on YouTube find a non-f video and create a Facebook video because it's probably not work if it's just a copy and it's just wrong frankly yeah it's not going to I mean obviously a lot of people know about this kind of thing so you need some creativity you need some level of intelligence or something to make it work you can just be like it's not like you could just say hey chat GTP make me a faceless YouTube channel and make it successful it's not going to work it's not going to work all right that was my I mean I don't know if it's a startup idea but I'm thinking of adding elements of this to my uh like I do want to do a video game channel I don't want to be the face of it people in the comments are going to be like yeah Jonathan you said that 10 times in this episode already um I don't want to be the face of it I honestly could do an entire Elden ring Channel I I I could do an entire Elden ring or general video game Art Channel I want to kind of do that I don't know why you're not doing it because because I didn't know about this [ __ ] [ __ ] now I do now I'm now I actually might I and and I think it's everyone should start a faceless YouTube channel it just at the very least don't do it guys can we not let's not air this episode because I actually want to do it now that's true that is so true let's use a really crappy thumbnail and title so no one watches it so hopefully NE no one got to this point in the episode but yes uh you you shouldn't start you should start a a faceless YouTube channel at the very least you're going to learn about the audience and you're going to learn these AI tools yeah which is a win it's worth the experiment anyway I mean what worst case is this you spend a couple hundred dollars on AI tools and you waste some time yeah that is the worst case and yeah you now know more about how to use these AI tools and and how to build audiences more than 99.9% of the population literally the worst case no one no one's heard of crayo no one's heard of these some of these tools so you you will be you know more advantageous than most people I'm deeply appealed by this idea I I there's a lot of appeal there's a lot of appeal and the and you know what does this look like if it if it works out well you've just created an audience that is is worth millions definitely uh and might have millions of views per month PE you know building Affinity um you know if you're working you might be able to quit your job you can double down you can like it it is so much leverage in your life it's the same reason it's the same pitch around like why start this you know go back to 2007 2008 2009 it's like could have made the same pitch about starting an Instagram account or starting a YouTube channel or starting a Twitter account it's like what is the downside you're going to lose some time and you know a few dollars yeah the downside of starting a real YouTube channel is that you then have to deal with like with your own face on it is that you have to learn to deal with trolls like talking about you and all that kind of stuff whereas the downside of starting a faceless YouTube channel is I like I like that I could be a bit more uh personally detached from the outcome and then I could just say Okay this episode didn't work well okay like for example when an episode of this podcast that I am on doesn't work out well I'm like [ __ ] like I didn't do a good job and my I am here doing like it's it's me right and in your comments someone will write don't put this guy on your podcast again and no matter how long I've been making content I still don't like that right and it's like you're putting yourself out there and you know someone's going to [ __ ] on you no matter what whereas but I enjoy the ACT I enjoy the art of making content um and so it feels like a more um personally separate way where I can just think about it as like an art project and like as something that I'm building like designing a website um there's something more mechanical about it that I actually enjoy yeah well I think there's I I if you fail the reality is this here's what you're not saying the reality is is if it fails it's it's not as personal it's not as personal and people don't specifically talk about how much they hate your specific [Music] face totally you know what I mean or like or like my accent or all these things like I've been on the internet for so many years I'm I'm I'm still not used to it I still don't like it and so that's what that's what would hold me personally back from making more uh content online um but yeah there are so many things I want to talk about I just don't want to be there having to film myself I want to be able to do it in a more nerdy way like making the visuals like you know I like to go into like a more nerdy smelly mode to make things sometimes um that sounds perfect to me but yeah maybe we've dragged this on too long but hopefully people I don't think so I don't think this was this was a reminder of start a faceless YouTube channel or start a faceless Channel go do it first time you've heard of it Greg say I messaged I messaged Greg this is just some behind the scenes uh I want I do want to bring something interesting to the podcast and I messaged Greg this stuff and I was like please tell me you don't know about this already but he did of course Greg already knows about all the stuff there's no way to no way to surprise him anything else you want to say before we jump I have another idea okay totally separate to this okay um or do you have an idea you want to put in or do you or do you think we should just end it with this focused idea I think we I I think we what do you think because I think focus is I don't know yeah I think one topic is pretty good I think one topic is pretty good yeah that's cool dude I'm I let us know in the comments if you're thinking of starting one of these I really hope one thing I do want to say is I really hope people what people do not take away from this I I hope the lesson they do not take away is I'm going to fill up YouTube with absolute dog [ __ ] content uh copy other people's stuff and just flood it with even you know with more crap and like hack the system and hack the SEO and and it's just all you know lowquality stuff I think there's that could work in the short term but I think the long-term winners here are going to be the people who put a a lot of love into it and even though you're not in the videos and even though you're getting help um maybe with script writers and and doing the visuals it's I I do think that people who can come up with really interesting Concepts find a really interesting Niche and then write well and then I almost feel like it's just a replacement for writing blog articles it's like people want to watch blog articles now you are not maybe a videographer you're maybe not a good presenter and so instead of you now writing what you're doing is making this type of faceless video and it's an audio version of what you would have written 100% yeah you nailed it you nailed it you nailed it I think there's a lot of short-term minded people in the faceless YouTube game but the long yeah the longterm the long-term Niche Focus um eventually building products and services ACP funnel as I always say audience Community product um should should do should do well and you at least you'll learn so this has been real uh and if you want to compliment Jonathan in the YouTube comments he is accepting compliments I got a haircut did did you notice you know like it's the only way the I hate doing this but it's the only way the video gets seen is if we get likes and comments so if you enjoy this just go in just go in quick quick like quick comment uh and that's how we know we should continue making these videos we do it for you and uh we do love you we deeply love you deeply hey look out for that Elden ring Channel I'm going to do an Elden ring Channel a Jet Set Radio channel a shenmo channel a cho cho Rocket channel a Crazy Taxi channel it's going to be too much Crazy Taxi wow I love Crazy Taxi good I was obsessively addicted to Crazy Taxi when was the last time you played Crazy Taxi probably when I was 14 you know there's a remake or there's a new version an open world massively massively multiplayer online version of Crazy Taxi is coming out I'm so out on that yeah why something that's So Glorious if they don't have The Offspring and bad religions music in there I'm not playing it yeah I mean I'm going to play it that that is that is hot news and that's actually smart to build the faceless Crazy Taxi YouTube channel before it comes out so when it hits you got to race me you got to race me to making that channel guys all right later everyone [Music]

there's a huge hedge fund information business I remind every one of my friends do you know who the richest man in New York is it's not it's nobody who works at a hedge fund or private Equity Michael Bloomberg by far he is the richest person in New York because he sells all the information and the picks and shovels to all the finance people and alternative asset guys are great customers because they're very rational if you make them money they don't mind paying you a lot they're not price sensitive at all they're very urgent they need the thing when they need it and so one of my ideas is like let's create a business where the customers are hedge funds and you know within within a week you and I could go get probably five billion do of AD spent on Facebook like agencies and friends who are running a lot of spend and we survey them you can pay them a ton of money to survey them and first you do it for meta then you go do it for Google then you go do it for Amazon then you do you basically go through the biggest public companies and you create information that the investment and hedge Phone World uses and I think that's easily a 10 million ebit do business maybe more
