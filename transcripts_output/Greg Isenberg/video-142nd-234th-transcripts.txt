you know hedge funds there's a huge hedge fund information business I remind every one of my friends do you know who the richest man in New York is it's not it's nobody who works at a hedge fund or private Equity this person's richer than schwarzman richer than all the hedge fund guys Michael Bloomberg no way wa he by far he is the richest person in New York because he sells all the information and the picks and shovels to all the finance people and so there's a bunch of when I I worked at Goldman there's a ton of information businesses and alternative asset guys are great customers because because they're very rational if you make them money they don't mind paying you a lot they're not price sensitive at all they're very urgent they need the thing when they need it and so one of my ideas is like let's create a business where the customers are hedge funds and you know within within a week you and I could go get probably five billion dollar of ads spend on Facebook like agencies and friends who are running a lot of spend and we survey them you can pay them a ton of money to survey them and first you do it for meta then you go do it for Google then you go do it for Amazon then you you basically go through the biggest public companies and you create information that the investment in hedge fund World uses and I think that's easily a 10 million ebit do business maybe [Music] more this is an absolute pleasure to have you Jesse puie this guy has what's up Greg hundreds of profitable startup ideas it lodged in his brain uh you're my go-to guy when I when I need when I want a jam ideas so thanks for taking some time today yeah absolutely let's let's get into it so what do you got for us well what genre do you want because I can I can take us in many different directions uh yeah you know I think maybe I'll start with my formula might be helpful and then we can talk about some of them and this is like you know having done launched a bunch of businesses some which have been very successful some which have f fa I think I've gotten a better formula down and one of my favorite things is like unique insight and unfair advantage and so part of unique Insight is like I always tell people look look at your own situation like who do you know one of my favorites is like cross-sections of things you know um like one of the very successful businesses we started last year is called Ox insights and it's helping private Equity firms understand marketing like we basically do diligence for them and help them get it it's like okay well those are two cross-sections that were kind of unlikely bedfellows that we've been able to build a very successful business in so that's one and then the unique Insight is like what's the problem in there that somebody's got U and unfair Advantage usually around distribution who do you know and so I I'll start with one for fun I'm not sure the audience will will love this one but when I was running ampush I was making like $200,000 a year doing GLG and like Alpha sites call and the reason was because all these hedge fund dudes had like 100 200$ 300 million positions in meta and they would call me every quarter and they'd go what are your clients doing are they spending more are they spending less like and I was like oh man I don't have time for this so I started I went from $500 an hour to $1,000 an hour to I'm not kidding $2500 an hour and I saw no drop off in volume okay so so like I was doing whatever number of calls a quarter and so I'll give you two ideas actually that came from this so the first idea is you know hedge funds there's a huge hedge fund information business I remind every one of my friends do you know who the richest man in New York is or richest person in New York who is it it's not it's nobody who works at a hedge fund or private Equity this person's richer than schwarzman richer than all the hedge fund guys someone in real estate nope Michael Bloomberg no way wait he by far he is the richest person in New York because he sells all the information and the picks and shovels to all the finance people and so there's a bunch of when I I worked at Goldman there's a ton of information businesses and alternative asset guys are great customers because they're very rational if you make them money they don't mind paying you a lot they're not price sensitive at all they're very urgent they need the thing when they need it and so one of my ideas is like let's create a business where the customers are hedge funds and you know within within a week you and I could go get probably $5 billion dollar of ads spent on Facebook like agencies and friends who are running a lot of spend and we survey them and you can pay them a ton of money to survey them or you can give them a trip to to the Bahamas every year in exchange for doing the survey and all the survey answers every quarter is did you spend more did you spend less you know what you whatever what are your metrics like you basically collect a bunch of really and you go to hedge funds you say I'll charge you1 $200,000 a year to have access to this information and it's going to give you an edge my my better idea even by the way for pricing is we're going to hold a reverse auction only 20 people will get this information bid to your highest bid that you're willing to pay for it and first you do it for meta then you go do it for Google then you go do it for Amazon then you do you basically go through the biggest public companies and you create information that the investment in hedge fund World uses and I think that's easily a 10 million ebit do business maybe more so I haven't seen a lot of people doing this but I actually think that if you used AI to scrape a lot of data and enrich your data that's also value ad and I feel like AI assisted just data data in itself is like if you're a hedge fun and you're not spending money on that you're like I don't want to be left behind dude there was a company that we paid 100,000 a month at Goldman maybe not quite that maybe 50,000 a month called first Reign and it was literally a fancy Google analy or Google alerts for public companies because the argument was you don't want to be the you know you need to know first when something happens to your stock and we are the fastest best way to get you that information and it was literally just Google Alerts like it and so I think there's a lot of ideas in this vein to the you know and this is a good example by the way of like getting super thoughtful about a customer and and who what they need and who they are and how to approach it but that's that's one of my ideas for for that world the other one is a is a broad idea I mean you know you've heard of alpha sites or GLG right yeah so for anyone who's listening um there's probably 10 of these companies all have been extremely successful their customers are hedge funds private Equity consulting firms and they basically Supply them with expert networks expert experts so if you I used to work at Goldman right and I had to get smart in the trucking industry so I went to them and I go hey guys I want to talk to a guy who owns 10 trucks I want to talk to one of the biggest you know I want to talk to a two truck drivers like actual truck drivers I want to talk to someone who ships through three different trucking carriers I want to talk to someone who's built the truck engines the special diesel engines like I made this whole request for them and and within two weeks they had experts for all of all of those people and I'm sitting there asking how does these diesel engine work is the techn Tey you're actually going to change the game blah blah blah I'm learning all about it right and they've all been very successful I'm talking nine figure ebit like multiple companies have hit nine figures in ebit da I think that whole Space is going to verticalized and as as my unfair Advantage like I would I'm G to ver you know we verticalized it in marketing like so and I actually think there's probably even more to it I think you could definitely sell into that group I think marketers would pay marketers to get a little bit of information around how do you do X Y andz um but I think there's an opportunity in building like a basically a marketing Centric expert Network quick ad break let me tell you about a business I invested in it's called boring marketing.com so a few years ago I met this group of people that were some of the best SEO experts in the world they were behind getting some of the biggest companies found on Google and the secret sauce is they've got a set of technology and AI that could help you outrank your competition so for my own businesses I wanted that I didn't want to have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I didn't want to depend on ads to drive customers to my businesses I wanted to rank high in Google that's why I like SEO and that's why I use boring marketing.com and that's why I invested in it they're so confident in their approach that they offer a 30-day Sprint with 100% money back guarantee who does that nowadays so check it out highly recommend boring marketing.com so Beyond marketing what are like three four five other verticals that could be interesting yeah I think I mean I I think there's all it stuff right I think healthc care is another one um I mean really you just go down the GDP list and you pick them off right Healthcare I think Auto um and AI right you could probably build a nice a AI expert Network that's just all all these foremost people in Ai and and I think the verticalization you know there was a company called tus I think that recently sold and and there's people innovating in the business model their Innovation was we're going to record every call transcribe it and 90 days after the call takes place we'll make it searchable and available in the database so they were actually creating data and aggregation of information that became very valuable and differentiating for them versus some of the other guys so you know I think there's things like that that can be very differentiating but yeah I mean any vertical again that you're in could be there could be a Content one it's just an expert you know go get a collection of 100 experts in content and people will tap want to tap into that in different ways totally I actually was thinking about this the other yesterday had a meeting with um my editor uh for my for my YouTube channel and podcast and I was like we should hire just like consult with the number one person on YouTube titles and thumbnails and like we'll pay Whatever Whatever It Is Well that's exactly for the marketing one I just want to get all those experts and I think not only could you do the Wall Street people as customers but I think you could do other marketers there's someone who really knows how to run Facebook ads for dog food someone else who really knows how to do Amazon for water bottles there's somebody else who and those people are sitting there with that information in their head and it kind of goes under monetized and I think I think there's a massive opportunity to connect the dots on those things and I think vertical the nice thing about verticalization is it it just it creates natural differentiation right it's like the one thing you could you could pitch against GLG or alphasight it's like well this is all we do we we focus on one specific vertical and it's just a natural pitch that everyone goes well yeah it's all it's all they do so if we're going to do marketing stuff we better talk to these guys because they're just naturally better in that space totally yeah you know they're they're the cheesecake The Cheesecake Factory there's everything on the menu that's right exactly and I think anytime yeah that happens all the time anytime something it's a whole vertical SAS thesis that people talk about is like there was AC CRM called Salesforce or whatever and now there's 50 CR M there's a CRM for Real Estate there's a CRM for by the way real estate would be another good vertical for this expert Network so both these ideas I buy like these are ideas like I'm scribbling notes I'm like I I want to start one of these but how do you actually go about growing some of these ideas like you know in your hedge fund idea I'm like yeah that makes sense but I don't know anyone in hedge funds you know in let's just say the real estate uh vertical or the automotive you know vertical like how do you go about you know taking this from idea to you know actually execution yeah I think who you are matters a lot in this situation like for me part of the reason the ideas come to me is cuz like I have 50 friends who are at hedge funds right and I just because I went to work college with a bunch of them I worked at a hedge fund for a few years and so I think the lesson for someone listening is like who are your friends like like what world are they in who you know because you I could kind of call any of my friends and they would all support me right and and this is small money for someone at a hedge fund but but in aggregate you start to build a business against it right and it's like well we like Jesse we trust him and so I think if if you're listening it's not go sell things to hedge funds well I'll come to that in a second actually but but I think you could you start with who you know and that's part of the unfair advantage and getting distribution early often and early right you sell things to the people who you have a relationship with or you have some understanding or knowledge or knowhow and I I think that's just an overlooked I think there's so many entrepreneurs who all meet you know they're like salese at whatever some business and they're like I want to start an e-commerce business and I'm like why like but look and if their answer is I love water bottles fine God bless right like that makes sense if that's really what you want but they're like oh no because because I saw shark tank and this I had this really smart idea and I'm like yeah I get it but like you've been talking to these people for you know the last five years like go sell them something you know go talk to them so that's that's probably the biggest push I'd have if you were to start this and you don't know anyone at hedge funds you got to go know people at hedge funds right like that's that's the only answer for the business which is why you go back to rule one and say well no just go find people you know somewhere and sell things to them but but I mean early on in ampush we did that and it's just like you know you you leverage your network extremely heavily I bet you with a with a week or two you could get 10 hedge fund meetings right through friend of a friend essentially or some some version of your network if you really cared obviously you go in you gota you got to bring it in those conversations you got to be really well prepared you got to explain why it matters to them you know you got to match their energy and their orientation you got to know their culture of the buyer um and and I think you'll have some good success with it and so you know again I I my recommendation is more so find the people you already know and find something to sell to them versus try to go and learn some new thing um yeah or partner you know be the back end and and find a front end with someone like you so if I if I was totally yeah if I was going to start something like this I would pick a really great name create a great brand build out the MVP and and then do two things I would set up cold DMS and and just start cold dming uh hedge fund managers people work in hedge funds just to like look at the website even if you know only 1% or less than 1% ends up opening you know your your messages and the second thing is I'd build audience around you know yeah around it I'd build memes around it you know funny enough like I do both of those things also I think you know that I do cold stuff and I also have learned how to build an audience um and I do think they have tremendous I think the media stuff is way more valuable than I ever expected it to be the first thing I would do is I have this crazy system on LinkedIn where I just find Mutual introductions and it works like a charm like you get your 50 targets usually you'll have a second degree maybe a third degree but even third degree works better than you would think like especially if it's like you right so I call you and I'm like hey Greg you know someone you know Andrew and Andrew knows the head of oxz like you're my friend it like it takes time it's a little more of a patient game but within a week or so you actually have a pretty good introduction and that's actually for all of my businesses how I started is using even when I was 25 by the way or 26 because everyone's now was like you have a huge Network Jesse which is true but when I was 25 or 26 I did the exact same thing to get the first 10 ampush customers they were through my network somehow and I would just I would sort of salute the people I wanted to talk to and I'd work backwards somehow to figure out how I could get an into them sometimes by the way it's not even on LinkedIn you would have to connect the dots by looking at a board member or C- level executive at a place and going oh they used to work at this company and I actually know someone was there any overlap there and and like again you work your network or you work the kind of connections a bit and next thing you know you're having a warm conversation with someone and and I think for me at least that's been the most tried and true way I've started every business yeah there's a there's an app I use called the org I'm not like Affiliated or anything but the org.com so you can just see like publicly traded companies and trending companies and seeing like who works there um you know track track them stay updated on team changes so I think using platforms like that is helpful the other thing I would do is uh besides the mutual connection thing is like I'd create content and I would just tag the people that I want to see the content in which works like surprisingly well if you're like super thoughtful like let's just say it's the uh you know the automotive uh you know business in business it's like okay go like research some stuff create something create a really interesting piece add an image or video to it because LinkedIn is optimizing that and then T you know tag two or three people that um like bring them into the content hope that they like it and if they like it reach out literally right away totally and I I think the other thing I I also find a lot of entrepreneurs doing and I think I did this but then I don't remember what I did when I was young fully but man if you go to someone and you're just honest and you put your hat in your hand and you say you know what like I think this is a good idea and I mean this for anyone like if I was starting this hedge fund thing and I didn't have a network I I know someone in finance I try to find someone senior in the finance World somebody's friend somebody's cousin someone something and I'd say listen here's the idea I have honestly I don't know if it's a good idea or not all I want to do is meet people to try to better understand if this is a good idea and if so what do I need to do to make it a real thing and man humans are humans and anytime I've come with that mindset or orientation to somebody all their that's happened is their heart has opened up to me and they've said you know what there's three or four people I think you could connect with and I think they'd really be able to give you a big perspective and if you come in pretending like you know everything and you're pitching everyone and you're selling everyone it oftentimes it has the opposite effect that you think and I think owning where you are and being authentic is in in the networking process is a really powerful way to get something going but you don't think someone's listening to this and they're like well easy for you Jesse you went to Wharton and then you worked at Goldman like what about the person who doesn't live in the United States didn't go to the great school doesn't you know his friends are his or her friends are just you know construction workers or who knows right what do you say to those people well again I say two things I think well one is depending on your age it does matter where you go to college and that's like a fun one on Twitter that I always throw at people because people love saying it doesn't and I can tell you that the biggest meal ticket of my life was going to Wharton um I went to a very average public high school with like middle class immigrant parents and man that that was a I I felt the step like I've felt the step in my life and I've continued to feel it ever since so that's one thing if you're 16 or whatever you are and you're wondering and you're reading this like it matters I think it matters so that's number one I think number two is again if you're Construction worker like don't why would you start a business selling to hedge funds it just makes no sense like sell a business start a business selling something to construction people right like find the problems in the world you're in every business can make money like there's no business that does you know it's not like selling to construction is better or worse than selling to hedge funds it's it's all just what you know um and then the third thing is I don't I mean I don't want to get too spiritual here but I definitely believe the quote that once you put out into the universe what you're trying to get done it conspires to help you created so even if you were a construction worker and you're like I do want to do the hedge fund thing you start talking about it at parties you put yourself out there you ask friends for introductions you you will it may take you longer than it took me right it may take you six months to get your first really valuable meeting but you will get a meeting and if you go to that person you say I don't I'm from the construction world but I think they should have data on construction and I want to sell it to hedge funds like people will start to help you and take notice and and I've never I've just just never experienced it I mean I don't know about you I think you're like me if some random person comes to me through a friend or through even a thing like an Uncle's cousin I usually take a call for 15 minutes and if they say like look I don't know what the hell I'm doing I need some help I was like well here's a few people like you know send me an email and I'll put a little bit of work on that person I'll say send me an email outline it tell me what you and if they don't ever follow up then like I know they're not serious but then some of them are like man they come back they follow up I'm like wow I met this person they seem to have a unique energy do you want to meet them and then I'll check came with that person in a year and guess what they have a business and they're running and so yeah I think even in the third case it's it's it is I wouldn't necess start but even in that third case I think when you put put things out into the universe and you're serious it starts to conspire to help you yeah and I think everyone has an edge too so% it doesn't make a difference like using the construction worker example it's like it's kind of interesting that your construction worker building a hedge fund thing and like you have this unique insight into that space into companies in in that space I remember when I first moved to San Francisco coming from uh Montreal Canada I didn't know one person and like literally no one uh and but I ended up meeting some people like at the Canadian consulate type thing and which is random and basically when people from France were coming to San Francisco and they wanted someone to show them around I like became known as the guy who would take these people people around San Francisco and I ended up bootstrapping my network from all these like French entrepreneurs who ended up like you know the founders of zley who sold it to snap for like three or $400 million all these like startups um and my my advantage was I spoke this language and so they wanted someone who spoke the language and that's it so you hav't yeah I definitely think I find I find that helping people I mean it's it's funny right this private Equity business business uh we sell you know we're basically helping private Equity firms assess companies marketing capabilities right that's and we charge a quarter million dollars a month for our services it's a very high ticket item half of the customers were students like I was like older than them and they're like VPS at these firms now VP plus and I was a you know and but I was helpful to them you know I prepped them for their interviews and I and I just did it because I cuz you know they're young you two years younger than me they're like hey Jesse you work in finance now can you help me prepare them it and that's that's just I don't know that's what I do I help people like I'm willing to help someone just because if people have helped me right and I'm just like okay now you roll in and imagine there VP or principal at Blackstone or pick your favorite and I'm like hey I got a new business I'm trying to start it what do you you know what what do you think is going to happen in that sales conversation they literally do everything and anything they can to find an opportunity for us to to collaborate on something and then I get to say Blackstone is a customer or whoever like like so it's just you know I think there's a lot to be said about finding ways to be helpful in ways that are true and unique to you again I think being helpful inauthentically everyone can tell but being helpful authentically to the types of people and to the like to the for the things that make you light you up or give you energy I think is a really valuable thing what other ideas you got um you want to do somewhere off-the-wall stuff yeah 100% so you know we started a couple supplement businesses in e-commerce which have kind of been a slog but I do think supplements are an awesome category I think they're high margin I think they're endlessly marketable and I think there's something really interesting about making the person feel like the supplement is meant for them okay okay so like let's use a most common example in the market there's Centrum which is this like daily multivitamin most of us have heard of then there's Centrum Silver and it's like oh that's for the old people and there's certain things in that that the old people need so one of my ideas is to take the world and this came actually I'll tell you if you talk to any South Asian again this is myself you talk to any South Asian dude you probably have a million Indian and Pakistani friends and if you I'll tell you like their lipid profile I can tell you right now they have low D3 they have high LDL they have some heart ISS like some you know maybe a little high cholesterol like a and probably high glucose like they they just have a similar profile because of you know genetics and the fact that we were not meant to eat pizzas and burgers we were meant to eat doll and Roy right like it's it's a very specific lipid profile so one of my ideas was like let's create a by the way South Asians are also the highest diper income in the United States higher than Jews higher than everyone else right let's let's create like an Indian South Asian men multivitamin like centrum's not the right one for them right like we'll call it musty right and it's G to be a hundred bucks a month and it's going to be meant for them and it's going to speak to their issues and it's going to talk about that and then I was like okay well what about for black women and what about for you know apparently lots of Jewish dudes have digestive issues like that's a common issue for Jewish dudes like so one of my Ecom ideas is basically like a a hyper demoed multivitamin or vitamin orientation and I think that like the ads on Facebook would just be perfect like it again it's back to this thing of you just find an area that no one else is in and I can the only one who can say I am this is the South Asian vitamin and is it 70% similar to Centrum maybe but like if you have the money and you why wouldn't you buy the thing for you yeah I like the idea of like a studio around this like kind of like how uh you know the m match group has dating apps for every category or IAC has a bunch of different verticals like what does that look like for for supplements for different demographics totally and and yeah exactly so I think that you do supplements for different demographics um the other thing I like about it dude is here's a couple other data points to think about one is this is a perfect example of something that could not be retail because there's just not you're not going to get shell space for there's not enough Indian people in any one area maybe maybe in in like Toronto or Vancouver but every other city in North America knowon Ontario Miss Saga maybe those two places but nowhere else in America in North America right but so that's number one number two is you could charge a lot for it number three is like it's you know there's I I forgot the number exactly but I think it's somewhere in the ballpark of 10 million uh South Asian so 5 million men South Asian in the US right growing growing category it's like 100,000 people paying you 100 bucks a month like that's a real business dude like that's that's like a nine fig it's a real business that's one of the verticals right so what I like about it is that it it just it fits in so many different places frankly I wish this is what I would have I had the same idea and I chose a different thing and I like we wish we would have done this but it's still on the list it's still on the list well thank you for sharing it and being open with it appreciate that um how do you go about I know nothing about like create creating supplements like how how does one go about doing that you know it's it's funny like it's uh some of these guys who were building like airplanes and aircraft every sometimes I'm like wow it's so incredible and then other times I'm like you know the world is like the beauty of being alive right now as an entrepreneur is like man there is a system there is a submarket and a whatever for everything so I had a similar intimidation in the beginning and then like obviously you can go in like order the raw materials and then find someone to mix your supplement like you could build a whole supply chain on the other side of it in the beginning you could literally go to third parties who will white label their supplements for you and let you sell them however you want like if you wanted to validate this dude you could have you and I could build this business in a week because there's a third party who will slap a label on something call it whatever we want and we can start running Facebook campaigns on it within a week and so the answer is that you start with something like that and then you slowly get more you know that's how we started then you slowly go okay wait let me actually work with a doctor and formulate something and they have their research and we do some other things and we start to formulate like a a proprietary blend of something and then you go to a third party who manufactures it for you and and that's it and again I'm sure as you get bigger you can you can keep ripping cost out and improving supply chain and all that stuff like it becomes a bigger function but early on it's just it would be silly to do all that stuff in my opinion so I'd first start with one of these third parties that will literally make it for you on demand whatever that and just throw a white label on it then I would go one level further and make a proprietary formula and then maybe when I'm a much bigger business I would like buy my own ingredients and maybe there's third parties that just mix it for you if you want that but in the beginning you just you just need something to sell someone and see if it works and you're you're uh a paid ads Savant so how would you go about thinking about your paid ads strategy for something like this yeah you know one of the funny things you know this right I've probably overseen over my career two three billion dollars in paid spend right we did it we scaled Uber to 100 million a year in 600 cities Dollar Shave Club to was spending three million a month with us for four years Stitch fix Casper you name it and and we basically ran at least their paid social if not all of their digital and when I started doing this on my own I totally it up um actually because I was so used to running bigger things that I was like oh go go create this special creative go do X go do y and it turns out that what you actually need to do in the beginning is the first month or two is what they call seasoning the pixel and so you create actually five to seven static non-v video ads that are very basic with your product with the pixel and you spend 50 bucks a day 25 bucks a day and the first week is going to be the worst results you've ever seen and then you'll see Facebook will start to learn your audience a little better and maybe every week you make a small adjustment just to what's working spend a little more on what what's working pause what's not working basically based on how much they're spending or what the metrics look like and then you and you kind of Let It Go and so what you should see is after two months the the pixel will be seasoned because like the CPA will be cut in half and you'll just notice that the metrics will all look better now Facebook knows who your audience is now you can get crazy with the video creative and some of the other things um that are you know ugc like the more engaging creative but part of it is you almost want bad creative up front because you want Facebook's algorithm to get a better and better signal on who your audience is and if you give them too much good creative like you know if I show you a pretty girl with dancing around or whatever you may buy the product even though you're not the Right audience and then Facebook kind of learns the wrong lessons you want them to learn oh this is like a really crappy ad but oh man it's an Indian supplement I'm Indian okay I'm gonna buy it man the site looks really bad but the formula looks good okay you want that to be your first 100 transactions to calibrate the audience really tightly and then and then you light up again video and ugc now one of the big mistakes people make here is you really shouldn't grow your spend until the the economics are profitable until your first order profitable which means let's just do this math if you're a $100 supplement it's kind of expensive supplement but let's just let's go with that you're probably doing 70% gross margins maybe more so you're making $70 in profit your CPA Target should be like 50 right at the highest because that makes you Mak money on every transaction and what you have to do is calibrate your spend your creative your metrics internally to that that would be considered a two row as right on your spend and it's too easy to convince yourself to spend more on a shittier metric and this what it forces is a discipline of sorts that you you're not allowed to scale until you can't spend more than $50 a day until that 50 is able to do and what what it means is you may spend six months trying to rip through different creatives and and hooks and all the things you know you and I know from the world of organic social but then when you get it and everybody gets it if they they stay long enough it is a it is a dream because now all of a sudden you have a money machine that you can just keep turning up um and if you read my newsletter we actually started using some like lending in our case and we didn't follow this Rule and it was a big mistake like it made us too too able to spend money too fast and that's actually a really bad thing in in customer acquisition and in terms of creative because like nowadays creative is you know is huge M the main lever like what do you what do you recommend to folks in terms of creating how do how do how do you create creative that that is going to get you that two row as yeah I mean I have a whole presentation I shared privately with a handful of of Business Leaders of that's like get the organic social formula which you and I know really well like is it a good hook is it gonna get someone to stop what they're doing and in order to do that I typically think of it as curiosity and benefits I think Craig Clemens the the guy from Golden hippo says that like make me curious and tell me what's going to benefit me right and that that's the first thing in the hook uh and and that means you got to know your audience you got to know your customer you got to know all these different things then uh then you got to deliver some value and usually it's informational value in the in the creative itself one of my favorite Frameworks is the Pas the problem agitation solution framework right where you say well the hook is something you have an issue with you don't immediately jump to the solution you you add you like uh you know and then you then you present the solution at the end of the ad and and obviously then you can trums on the landing page my favorite example of this like this has become my favorite product this is like if I was Oprah this is Jesse's product of the year uh is have you seen this Air Moto thing no so okay so once you have kids and you're a dad one of the random jobs you get assigned of many there's many many jobs like suitcase carrier and whatever you just you are the inflating guy you inflate okay you inflate tires on bikes you inflate car tires if something goes wrong with your car you inflate pool toys um there just nothing you don't inflate your responsibility is to inflate it's just it's the law of dads right and so I get this ad on on Tik Tok and it's like it's like you know it kind of is making fun of this like you know do you get annoyed by this you have to do it and then it agitates the out of you it's like shows the guy at the gas station looking for quarters trying to fill his wife's tires and he's pissed off then he comes home and his kid's like can you fill the bike tire for me and the bike tire keeps deflating and it's like it's annoying and he's sweating and dud it was like I was like yes yes that's me like you know it's such a random thing too because I would never consider myself and I was like man these guys like I was just so agitated and then they're like it's a mini compressor so it's like this tiny little compressor right it connects it it's really smart it's automated you can press a button plug it in and it just goes until it needs to turn itself off it can just set to whatever PSI you need to right and I kid you not I like bought one and it blew my mind like I handle all the things even taught my son now how to do it he's a little older like you know it's like just a total Game Changer like it literally like we like joke about it and then I was like I just bought 10 of them and every man I know I just give them like here you go here's an aoto dude dude and so the second the last part is kind of extreme but like the example of great creative was knowing your customer really well presenting the problem like connecting and then really agitating it um and again they just did a wonderful job of like and every single agitation was felt very real for me being at the gas station trying to find quarters to fill my my wife's car my you know my kids incessantly asking me to and that's just that's a that's a perfect example that's the case study that's why before you do ads do or organic content because it totally alongside yeah 100% yeah because it allows it's R&D basically and here's the other thing about people get so strange about organic and I man I I scream this at the top of my lungs I'm like if your organic sucks no one sees it yeah by defin even mine and yours now we probably write certain like I've written tweets I'm like this is gonna Crush gets like 1,200 Impressions and I'm like all right well that was a bad idea but guess what no one saw it like it's totally asymmetric and and the world you know everyone talks about the beauty of asymmetric payoffs I mean it has no downside whatsoever it's just it's like an ego downside people are afraid to look stupid and I'm like man I no one sees it like your bad tweets no one sees them 100 per. um before we move on from supplements I have a a related thing I want I want your feedback on actually so a buddy of mine his name is Rob Jama he's when he does something he sold the company to Shopify when he does something I I really pay attention and he launched something new the other day which I thought was really smart so he is Somalian uh by ethnicity he's Canadian lives in Toronto but he started this uh skincare line this is like a digital guy like a software guy and it's called it's called Uh the company's called glean but it's this it the product called cazel which is an allnatural multi-purpose ingredient used for thousands of years to help alleviate redness and diminish hyperpigmentation cool but it's targeted towards people who H are East African and it kind of reminded me a little bit about your thesis here so what do you think about what do you think about this business and and have you ever thought about like skin care or beauty in that category Beauty and skincare is a great category it's not one I know super well I don't I mean I kind of accidentally know supplements I think look how expensive it is too $17 this has got to be super high margin right it's you can just see that it's there yeah I love it man I think it's I think it's great I think the question I would like I want to see the Facebook account my guess is a 70 75% gross margin the bottle looks a little fancy so maybe a little lower than that shipping matters a lot in these things you know like even the weight basically the weight below one pound matters a ton to keep the costs really low because of the USBs shipping site looks fine I mean it's not I would look at it in Mobile because that's where all the traffic will come like the desktop nobody goes to the desktop website [Music] um but to me I would want to see their ads library on Facebook and I'd want to know from them do they have an ad that generates greater than two row ads like you know and and it's all the only thing that matters in Ecom dude is first order profitability it's just the only thing that matters Ms and if you can't be first order profitable and scale then it doesn't matter it's your basically the market will tell you if the idea is good or not based on that metric and your ability to obviously put good creative out there um assuming your product you know there's demand for your product um and then obviously like I I should you know one thing I should say one big lesson we learned was having a good unique bleeding edge product like the guys who have done colostrum there's like multiple nine fig Revenue startups because they were really early to that Trend like that Trend matters a ton in these categories of beauty and and supplements that's like if I could go do what if I could go tell myself one thing when we launched the supplement world I would have said Trends find something more on the bleeding edge don't pick like we picked God heal and it's just such a tired category we just I just wouldn't have done that that's the one piece of advice I would have told myself I'm sure I wouldn't have listened to myself but that's what I myself Jess you have time for one last idea yeah of mine yeah or I can I could jump in no no I got I got a bunch um give me a genre and I'll give you a good idea I I like these Niche ideas like I I I like you know your first idea was really like unbundling and the second you know second idea was it was like demographics so anything here's one I texted our CTO about last night okay do you you don't have kids so you don't so there's a guy called Perry grip on Spotify and and he's got the catchiest kid songs you've ever heard in your whole life okay like I know them all so I will sing like one is called my favorite one is called Haunted cupcake and he's like oh haunted cupcake sitting on the plate or I want to eat you but I'm too afraid what are you filled with nobody knows is it creamy butter or a spooky ghost haunted cupcake haunted cupcake there's that there's like it's raining tacos and basically my kids from four to six I mean if you looked at my Spotify obsessed with it and this guy reportedly makes like a million bucks a month because he just I mean you can just look at he's hundreds of millions of streams of these songs right and so my idea I texted R CTO last night and he he was like playing around with AI stuff and for un for our supplement brand and he he created a song about our supplement brand and it's a good song using AI so I was like could we like create kind of like the ghost kitchens like could we create like ghost Spotify channels that are kids music that are all AI basically driven and and just make a ton of M like like you can make an unlimited amount of Music basically and I don't know how distribution Works in that world like I don't know how Perry grip got popular I like my kids I'm guessing other kids told I have no idea I have to that's the part I don't understand it makes me a little nervous about it like I don't understand distribution but feels like a good idea how does it work with sunno and and some of those products like you know I created like the theme song of this show the startup ideas podcast which 90 80% of people love it but 20% of people like have nightmares about it I used uh suo to create it but like could I go and put that on Spotify and earn Revenue like who owns the music I don't I have no idea that's a great question my guess is you own it but I don't know I mean we have to look at the us but one way or another there's a way to use AI I mean chat GPT you could make me a funny Melody about I mean this guy haunted cupcakes like yeah the guy I mean well I'm a creative enough person and so is Adam our CTO that I think we could brainstorm topics like that and just see like what are things kids talk about and like I want like even like you know my as my kids got a little older my older two are nine and seven now like they're into like boobs and farts and like and I bet you like there's probably a whole genre of songs I mean dude there's a Spotify channel that takes various categories and just says it just it repeats the exact same Lyric over and over again and it's really catchy but it's kind of annoying what the hell is it called it's like mango yeah it's called H that's strange that's the name of the channel okay and it's I don't know if you can even hear [Music] this mango mango mango mango okay so do you know you want to know what the other songs are yes okay you're gonna you're gonna be blown away by this you ready I'm ready cheese cheese chees cheesy [Music] cheesee okay you want to do one more do one more let's do one more can you guess what it's going to be mango cheese eggs donut the number one is the serial song it's all the same is the point it's just written it's written to that thing and they like they have 50 volumes of songs I mean maybe these guys are doing this already yeah this is a huge Insight that you've blessed us with which is which is it's easier to create music now than ever you can monetize off these platforms and children's music all is kind of sounds the same I mean dude there something we're gonna I want to see how how hard it'll be us for us to try this yeah this is my dream by the way like all my businesses like you know private Equity Consulting for marketing is like it's not an easy you know it's hard you got to get good people you got to know your you're like my dream would be to make a million bucks a month off a business like this yeah

the last thing that I really look for is distribution hacks and formats so for instance if you can break the Tik Tok algo then the scale at which products can grow is just so immensely huge that's definitely like a big thing that I look for so and I think there's probably a thousand startup ideas that you can do just by looking at what's trending on Tik Tok in terms of challenges and making it easy for those people to do those challenges but yeah that's that's generally the the thesis yeah I mean the thesis is algorithm breaking products that's the stuff that's going to get shared and it's stuff that's going to you know really works now so um I do like that [Music] thesis okay new character unlocked near I had to I stalked you on the internet because I saw that you posted some Banger ideas verified bangers and I was like I need to get this guy on the Pod sharing the ideas give the people what they want and uh and you said okay so thank you for coming so all I know from you are those ideas that you shared and they are some of the most interesting ideas that I I have seen in a long time and I see a lot of startup ideas so I was hoping you could just take us through some of them you know what the idea is why why you think it's interesting how you'd start them how you'd grow them just give people all that sauce and uh all right let's um so we can start top of the list if we want to just kind of work our way down so the first idea was something called Baby fund and the principle of baby fund was basically a just giving for parents to raise money for their kids and that money can only be invested in index tracker funds and the idea is um you know if you invest x amount of money and you maybe keep topping it up by the time the child is 18 that money will be worth quite a lot of money and the the reason why I thought about it was a whole Confluence of like different things so I'm at the age now where all of my friends are thinking about having kids or deciding oh no I can't afford to have kids and you know then you hear all of the discussions around like the demographic um worries and the Western World and cost of Child Care at least in the UK is a real really significant problem and something that is putting off a lot of you know Millennial potential parents um so that was that kind of Drew me to the problem in the first place and the second thing I was thinking about was um do you know the idea of like wedding Registries is that a thing that you guys have yeah it's it's a thing it's a thing I mean it's it's it's from what understand a lot less popular today than it was like 20 years ago um yeah but it's it's still it's still thing it's it's still definitely thing and a wedding registry is basically two people are going to get married they send around a link to all of the in uh all the people attending being like here's a list of all the things you could buy for us um for our wedding you know it's a fancy plate it's a nice spoon it's a honeymoon I've always really disliked it I've always kind of felt like this is this is a really stupid thing to do anyway it happens and but the idea of it is quite interesting because you're crowdsourcing um these people to contribute to your future as a married couple so I was thinking well what about if you take that principle and apply it to money going towards a newborn baby and their future so yeah the idea is really you know crowdsourcing money from parents and Friends of parents to um invest in that baby future and um the money can only be used for investing in index tracker funds um it can't be taken out you know before then it will go in the in the name of the child and um yeah I I think it's pretty um interesting because I do what you say as well around like crawling in into the the subreddits and when you kind of crawl into the the subreddits of like you know parenting and parents just cost of that is a big worry and also just yeah can I guarantee or can I provide for my child like will I be able to ensure my child has a reasonable standard of living in 18 years and when I can't do that for myself like when I worry about my own standard of living in 18 years um you know the the probability that I could do it for my child is a lot lower so the principle is that um yeah yeah so when would future parents actually share the link like is this during their wedding is this during like hey you know we're thinking of having a kid um funded is this like my wife's PR you know we're pregnant and you know when when is the right time funny that I was thinking the baby shower was a really good time uh to do it um or is that when they're that's when they're announcing like the gender of the child and all of that kind of stuff I think yeah okay I think I think the baby shower is a great time I can definitely imagine um a link for the upcoming baby a QR code which can just be printed out and you know donate to our kids future or help you know help invest in our baby's future and everyone can just kind of donate 10 pound 20 pounds um however much they want to donate and yeah here's how I think it should H okay so I think the way it should work is it's kind of like partile or one of those event platforms but for baby showers or gender reveals so you you know this is this is really smart because you create the utility uh for that moment and uh so you essentially create like a SAS product um quick ad break let me tell you about a business I invested in it's called boring marketing.com so a few years ago I met this group of people that were some of the best SEO experts in the world they were behind getting some of the biggest companies found on Google and the secret sauce is they've got a set of technology and AI that could help you outrank your competition so for my own businesses I wanted that I didn't want to have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I didn't want to depend on ads to drive customers to my businesses I wanted to rank high in Google that's why I like SEO and that's why I use boring marketing.com and that's why I invested in it they're so confident in their approach that they offer a 30-day Sprint with 100% money back guarantee who does that nowadays so check it out highly recommend boring marketing.com then once you have them hooked it's like oh you know hey now we have this like widget that is basically like the Donate widget and I think the way to do it and like the viral moment is let's say you give a $100 you don't show that it's $100 you show that it's you know $10,000 in 2055 yes exact yeah totally yeah yeah so that's what you do so and then you allow those people to share that moment so let's say I donate a100 $100 I'm not you know the share widget isn't I donate $100 no of course not it's it's the I donated the $15,000 and then in small writing in 250 assuming this level of return with the S&P 500 yeah exactly yeah yeah exactly and and I think that's the way you know sort of a framework for people to think about how to you come up with startup ideas is like one is like thinking about life moments Milestones then think about how you create a utility around that life moment or Milestone that could be consumer or B2B and then it's uh what is the viral moment that you can reverse engineer so that you just increase and I think that um you know I I spent a lot of time in the in the fire like subreddits and the there is something really interesting about that larger potential number of investing into an index tracker fund that I don't think is really utilized that much and that's actually an idea that principle inspired another idea of mine which was um anti- spend which is the next idea on the list all right tell me more about it okay so anti- spend is an app that basically tracks the money you don't spend by being more thoughtful more thoughtful about your day-to-day spending Behavior and the idea of it is again um this is something that I do I'm generally a pretty cheap guy um and there's always this mental maths that I there's like mental Maths game that I play with myself you know if I'm hey if I make coffee today before I go out into town instead of buying coffee from that Cafe I've saved myself like4 um and it's almost like girl math but for a cheap guy um and um and I think what's really interesting is then hey if I invested that 4 into the S&P 500 in 30 years time that4 could be worth X and I was just generally thinking um you know there's a lot of um you know there's when we're making transactions when we're making purchases there's a lot of like thoughtful thoughtless purchases right and a lot of these like instant dopamine hits so one thing for me is when I get stressed I once a month I'll just buy a pizza like from uberit and it'll be terrible for me and it's like super expensive for what it is it's like a [ __ ] pizza and um that dopamine hit from just pressing purchase is like yeah okay that will do something for me um but really it's just like a lot of money wasted for nothing and usually those kinds of purchases are things that are not actually really good for me in the long run anyway um so I think there's this like Confluence of thoughtless purchases usually resulting in something bad for me anyway and that money could have been spent better so what I really wanted to do is can you create a dopamine hit from not spending money so you know if I was on Uber Eats about to make that you know 20 pound Pizza purchase um could I create an alternative dopamine hit from being like no I'm not going to spend that 20 instead I'm going to save that 20 by not spending it um and then what I'd really want to do from there is you know build up this um balance of money that you haven't spent and that is money that could in theory then be invested in an index trer fund and what is also interesting about this is the cost of the pizza is not 20 right the cost of the pizza is that 20 invested in the S&P 500 over 30 years um so um I think there is again this like I think there's two things one thing is a viral moment from just having how much money have you decided to not spend and how much is that money worth and secondly from a monetization perspective I'd really think about how do you connect create that link from the money you've saved to then money being in actually invested in like a Vanguard fund like are there affiliate revenues that could be generated from being like Leen for Vanguard or whoever else there is um and I think just on top of that I think there's a number of different movements that where anti- spend would actually be kind of interesting so I think there's the fire movement first of all um secondly I think there's like an environmental movement of people trying to actively consume less spend less so if you go on Tik Tok there are people who do a lot of these no spend challenges so like I'm not going to spend money on new clothes this week or I'm not to spend money on anything this week um so I think there is this um combination of people either trying to save money or trying to Veer away from like excessive consumerism um or just trying to protect the planet where actually something like this and tracking that behavior would maybe be kind of interesting but yeah C curious to to get your thoughts so what I here's what I like about this idea I like the idea that you looked at Tik Tok and challenges and said how can I unbundle this challenge into an app so and I think there's probably a thousand startup ideas that you can do just by looking at what's trending on Tik Tok in terms of challenges and making it easier for those people to do those challenges what what I don't love about this app is I'm kind of like okay if I actually were going to go and create this app I have to get people like as you said pressing that that button on Uber Eats for 20 pounds and getting that pizza is like at that moment it feels like life or death it is so important to you and it's almost instinctive and Primal to actually go and uh press that button this is a completely new habit that isn't fun to do and uh there's a lot you know I I I really like business ideas that are uh swimming Downstream instead of swimming Upstream like I think that's the best way to describe it and for me the you know you're getting someone to download an app and which is like upstream and then you're getting people to save which is upstream and then you're getting people to input uh their goals which is Upstream um I think there's a business that uh what you know our our agents LCA actually uh worked with um I don't know if you've seen it it's called a crew have you seen this so they have a uh a an interesting model going after I think a little bit of this this Market where they they said okay there's all these uh buy now pay later uh services and it's kind of like making the world a worst place um because people are buying things that they can't afford so what they did is you know they integrated into these Point of Sales and instead of you know buying now and paying later it's like set your account goal and it's like this wallet where you can add funds to it and you might not be able to afford this $3,500 eight Sleep mattress today but you know in 6 months if that's your goal then you can you can save up for it and what I like about it is it it in it makes the merchant like they can use this as a marketing thing so you're getting the and it's at the point of sale so they have the traffic so you're swimming Downstream swimming Downstream so that's my my question for you which is like how do you make how do you make the a business like this more more swimming Downstream versus swimming Upstream yeah that's a that's a really that's a really good point um and I think part of part of the motivation for doing it is trying to alter behavior um which makes it way harder to do um and I think one thing I was thinking about which is semi- related was I was thinking about Apple pay and how you know Apple pay is very much the way that I'm making a lot of these purchases um and I was thinking about you know opal the the app that is about reducing like screen time and stuff um I was thinking about what does an opal look like for making payments with your iPhone because on the iPhone you know you're tracking like all of the payments you're making with Apple pay you know is there a way of just accumulate or like consolidating all the data um and even just doing things like are you sure you want to make that purchase or can you set a hard limit on your Apple pay like you know I just want to have A1 pound budget um you know I don't want to spend more than10 with Apple pay on like thoughtless purchases um so set that hard limit and then when you hit that limit there's like a notification being like are you sure you want to make that purchases are you sure you want to make that purchase or take a minute to you know decide if you want to um which maybe is a little bit more I wouldn't say it's necessarily Downstream but if there is that motivation to be like hey I want to I want to control my spending then you know you convert that high intention to an action which is I'm going to set a daily budget and then the app just continues to work in the background unlike the anti- spend app which is every time you're about to make a purchase you're swapping the app and adding you know the payments so I think there's maybe ways to make it a little bit less yeah a little bit less effort and more autopilot um another idea which again was related to it and going back to what we discussing earlier um was and this is not a really good business idea at all but um I uh I was thinking about a uh if you did want to control your spending like a Chrome extension that would basically show the true cost of the items on the checkout page so the true cost of that1 sweater from uniclo is10 invested in the S&P 500 over 30 years um so um or even even worse like luxury goods right like you just bought you know a Louis Vuitton purse for $112,000 but it really cost you know $28 uh yeah so yeah I think uh you're circling around something that I think uh could be really a really good business idea I think going back to your Apple pay uh idea I think that's really smart I think if I was trying to create a business idea around that I would probably call it something like angel or devil everyone has like an angel or a devil you know uh an angel or devil decision and it's like you just you just you know it's 1 in the morning and you get an Uber an Uber Eats you know pay Apple pay notification and then you get like a DM from from you know angel or devil saying like you probably shouldn't have done that and I think the bigger idea is it's like a financial Cod coach in your pocket that could be that's just a lot more casual and does help you hit your goals and does know your goals and you know this is like an AI coach basically um but it's a bit more Whimsical and it's a bit more fun to help you actually like reach your goals and stuff like that so I think that that's something that could be a good business um because I think again it's like one of those things that could go viral has that Viral moment um and uh and I do think that you're tapping into this macro Trend around people are really stress right now around costs of of of any items products Services anything inflation is like top of mine I don't even think people knew what the word inflation meant five years ago literally you know they's like oh inflation yeah I think I remember you know that like doesn't that you know isn't that like an economics term like what does that even mean now it's like people can't afford their lives period and so I think that there's a ton of opportunities to create a set of products around that so there's something here I'm just not sure it's it's uh exactly the anti- spend app What's um what's your next idea my next idea related to um you know the last few ideas are focusing on um trying to create dopamine hits for doing something good or creating a friction when you're about to do something bad and the other idea that I had that's kind of around that theme is an app called cold turkey and I have a lot of friends who are trying to give up vaping and I was crawling through the subreddit on um people trying to give up vaping and there's a lot of people find it really hard um people find it really tough to quit um and I saw people sharing screenshots of very much like you know habit forming apps you know the really kind of boring stereotypical habit forming app of look at my 4- day streak and look at this calendar of how many days I haven't Vaped for so one thing I was thinking about was firstly um really going Niche with the problem like if you were to just take some elements of that of those habit forming apps and just focus on like one thing which is let's say quit vaping um and secondly how do you create that dopamine hit from wanting to quit vaping now so rather than oh if I make it through to tomorrow and I say that I haven't Vaped I get my one day streak um how can I create a dopamine hit now so what I was thinking was you know as soon as you um decide that I don't want to vape I'm going cold turkey you're just seeing like like okay instant dopamine hit time is going up this is how long you are cold turkey for and I could you really gamify that experience where maybe you've got like three lives um and um you know there Tim is going up there's some cool visual thing happening as you're just progressing and as that counter is you know going up and up and up and then there just be like one button the one button would be I've got a craving I'm craving um and then if you press that one button um there just something that takes place to try to distract you for 5 minutes so usually when people talk about how do you distract yourself from craving there's like advice around take five minutes to breathe distract yourself for five minutes you know all these kinds of things um so what I was thinking was well what about if it was just you know a series of math questions that were just getting progressively harder for 5 minutes like could you embed these like mini games um into it and for like a bit of a viral Loop um there'd be maybe one other button which is just like share and you can share your timer let's say it's cold turkey.com Greg um you know you share that with all of your friends and they can just get realtime updates of how long you were called turkey for yeah just the idea of basically how can you spice up the design of something that is now I think a little bit boring at least with like habit forming app and then how could you like Niche down on one really uh important problem right now that people are trying to tackle um so yeah that that's the idea of cold tury so I love this idea um there has been a lot of I'll give it an analogy to to the to uh to to this app so one of the most popular apps like on the App Store is the zero app which is tracking your intermittent fasting so I think they have yeah they have 500 they literally have 500,000 F star reviews on the App Store like people love it and it's you know they took a trend intermittent fasting and they just made it way more fun to see you know how many how many calories you're burning like when did your fast start when did it end um seeing your results um just did an incredible job and I think that the zero fication of all these things like just create a beautiful app make it purpose-built you know add game Dynamics a at a social element is just going to work in so many categories and the word of mouth of these businesses is so great cuz you know how many people do you go and you I don't know about you but at least myself like a lot of people I just just hear people telling me like oh I'm intermittent fasting I'm intermitted fasting like the it's like the cold plunge Community right like they love they love talking about you know hi my name is Greg and I I cold plunge like it's the first thing they they like talking about so with vaping which has become a real problem um that and people are addicted to I know one person like in particular like a you know a friend of mine just like he tries to get off it and he he he really struggles so I I think I think that I like this idea I I wonder if you can add a financial element to it so like what if you know I could donate to n's an to you know if near hits aund you know a 100 days without vaping I'll give him $50 um and maybe companies could also support people as well and so there's that additional um incentive there and and and peer pressure to like continue continue the streak so that's just like one idea for you and so I I do like this idea and I think that with the model of of zero like all you really need is just the you know the name which actually this name is is really good um a catchy name some beautiful designs and and then you can just like go on like an upwork or something like that and just be like hey I'm trying to like build this I'm trying to build an MVP um try to build something like pretty cheap um get some micro influencers to start promoting it and um then you're probably going to want to add some paid features where you know for more power features you'll charge a monthly fee for it people are going to want to spend money and support this app because again like you're helping them get off something that's very deadly and it's and um so I do I do really like this app for for uh a lot of reasons there was um one other thing I was thinking about Loosely was you know in the same way with just normal gaming apps um you have the ability to pay for boosters or you need an extra life um and I was wondering whether the same thing could happen here you know let's say it's like two lives and if you want to have an extra life and not have all your pro ress kind of gone to waste um maybe you have to pay to get that extra life it's probably a little bit evil in light of trying to help people so maybe that's not the right play um but I I do think whether the models that have exist you know like the gamification of like real world things is something that I think about a little bit and um can you begin to just inject some of those monetization mechanics that have worked really well for games and apply that in these other contexts that are like real world contexts um and real problem contexts well it's the uh it's the octalysis framework I know have you heard of that framework no what's that okay so so octal's framework is for anyone who's thinking about creating a a product that feels like a game and so just it's really just a list of all the things that you need to do um and I find it super helpful and I use it you know in most of the products I create so number one is epic meaning and calling so the drive to become part of something bigger than ourselves uh number two development and accomplishment the drive to level up improve and Achieve Mastery number three empowerment of creativity and feedback the drive to use one's creativity and adjusting through feedback number four ownership and possession the drive to collect accumulate and organize number five social influence and relatedness the drive to collaborate compete and express social appreciation number six scarcity and impatience the drive to obsess over what we see but cannot have number seven unpredictability and curiosity the drive to Crave what is unpredictable and new and lastly number eight loss and avoidance the drive to avoid what is undesirable or changing one's Behavior so this like this octalysis for framework it's by uh yuku Chu is just a really helpful kind of like shorthand uh checklist of if you're creating something like this like the zero app 4X it'll just okay I need you know uh call it uh epic meaning and calling like what you know H how can I make this feel bigger than themselves or I need to you know you know social influence the drive to collaborate and compete so it just gives you these little reminders um and uh it works like it just works so yeah you know I think that a yeah it works that's awesome yeah what uh what's your next idea um so my next idea semi- related to this was I was going through the uh subreddit for parents and one of the common problems that was discussed was how do I get my kid to do things they don't want to do so my kid never wants to brush his teeth they never want to eat their dinner um you know they they they don't want to do all of these things so when I was in uh you know we call it Primary School when between the ages of like 5 and 11 um we had this idea of like gold stars in class so you do something good you get a gold star and then at the end of the semester there would be this counting of like gold stars and you know whoever gets the most gold stars you know get something um you know you get a little trophy or a badge whatever um so I was thinking again on this theme of like gamification um would you be able to create let's say the gold stars app uh a gamification app for parents to use with their kids and it's really just tracking the behavior of their kids in a really fun highly visual way where you just here's a star for brushing your teeth today here's a star for cleaning your bedroom and then you know what you could do is set like Milestones where let's say after 100 Stars you can buy something uh maybe you can buy something maybe you can set the Milestones before like Jimmy when you've got 100 gold stars pick anything from this Amazon site and that's going to be a reward and when you got a th000 gold stars dream bigger let's have a bigger budget let's have $500 you know get that PlayStation 5 you've always wanted and could you just set this um reward framework for you know the gold stars that becomes the thing that's like mediating the parents and their kids in terms of trying to reward good behavior keep track of good behavior um in again a really fun way like a lot of the parenting apps I see are just really boring they're just like really boring looking um and and I think you'd want it to be so visual that the kid and their parent are like looking at it together and you know tracking how many gold stars they've got um but yeah again this theme of gamification of um getting people to do good things what what you're talking about is the Starbucks app for [Laughter] kids that's what you're talking about basically I have the Starbucks app and you know this is this is this podcast is called the startup IDs podcast and uh a lot of our listeners you know like to call it sip you know sip SI and uh I've been sipping on a lot of nitro cold brew recently and I've been earning Stars few Stars oh literally Stars okay LLY star so for for people listening I'm showing my Starbucks app which I know makes me sound super basic but the Nitro cold brew takes you to outer space and gets you in the zone and uh it's it's basically you know you've got your star balances it makes you feel good you there's like a basically a leaderboard of things that you can get um there's different offers and you can just have a a a a similar thing for kids um it's just like you know it's the same concept but for kids the way the way the Starbucks app works is you know you go and you let's say you order a Nitro cold brew and it's $5 you know they scan the barcode which is essentially your payment and and then you get the stars and you can have a similar thing where it's like a QR code for scanning like for completion and stuff like that um and yeah man I think I think this is like a really cool idea I actually think that you can create like the future phone for kids is called the star phone and it's like built around this whole concept I love that so I I I I I think it's a cool idea I think like okay tactically like how you know you don't want to start with the you know building a phone because that costs a lot of money but I do think that you know building an app make it super simple let people like you know set what they're trying to incentivize make it fun where it's different than a Starbucks app is like when I open the Starbucks app it's like this green it kind of feels sterile like how do you make it feel super fun make it feel like a video game yeah yeah I love that yeah I I think there's a lot of a lot of the problems we've been discussing are really just dealing with behavioral things and trying to gamify you know good things and punish bad things um and then it's just a case of picking who the person is and what their problem is so it's like okay you got a vape prediction cool here's here's the app for you you're a you're a stressed out parent with a really naughty child like this is the app for you um so yeah I I I really like this uh this gamification kind of um process for real world things yeah yeah I mean it sounds like we're we're we're coming like one of the themes in a lot of your ideas is pick up something that's you know people don't want to do that's boring that's hard to do that requires effort and make it fun tie a financial incentive a lot of the times not in this case with kids but there is some incentive um for the kids to complete it and and then come up with a catchy name like that's that's your that's your thesis it sounds you know am I am I missing anything no that's that's basically it and I think the the last thing that I really look for is just like distribution hacks and formats so for instance on Tik Tok like okay these people are getting a lot of views for talking about giving up spending okay that's interesting like you know that to me says that there's something about this behavior that breaks the algorithm so if I can reverse engineer a product to arrive at that output easily and faster for people then that to me feels like oh okay there's a way for this to get distribution uh or to like crack the algo and the thing is if you can break the Tik Tok algo then the scale at which products can grow is just so immensely huge that's definitely like a big thing that I look for or in the case of like a Reddit um thread it's just like okay this is a common problem that is top of mind for some people um so maybe the first thing is dropping into that subreddit with hey by the way like here's a thing for you guys um I think maybe the you'd have to really engineer the viral mechanics I think a lot better because you're I don't think those are necessarily like algorithm breaking moments um but but yeah that's that's generally the the thesis yeah I mean the thesis is algorithm breaking products yes right that's the stuff that's gonna get shared and it's stuff that's gonna you know really works now so um I do like that thesis um we have time for two more ideas okay let's um let's go for something completely different um so the first one is um long live research Inc and this is is so I had a company a newsletter before that was called um patent drop and what patent drop would do is it would summarize three new patents from Big tech companies every week and it was really just about um scraping the patent database bringing it to people with a short brief summary and it was really focused on hey if you're interested in the future like you need to be reading this newsletter and what that experience taught me was firstly there is a lot of value from really fragmented information or information that just like hard to find and bringing that to people where they are in a way that's easy to digest and I think the second thing is again going back to that algorithm breaking moment that kind of distributional Advantage so with patent drop I would really just look for patents that had interesting visuals that I knew would break the algorithm it was like okay meta working on this brain Computing helmet thing would definitely get people talking and the distributional thing is validated from oh yeah like all of these journalistic Publications always write about like ah look at what Apple working on look at this Payton from Apple so it's like okay cool like let's just centralize it let's own that format that format right now is not owned by someone let's own that format so similarly with um long live research it'd be doing the same play but it would be doing it for academic research that is looking at the extension of life and quality of life and it' just be kind of running it back in theory but basically let's say um you know I'm near I'm South Asian so you know problems that I need to avoid are like type 2 diabetes um maybe some like cardiac issues um my father had cancer so let me just like I'm interested in cancer I input all of those um things and then okay long live research is just sending me as soon as there is research focused on how to um extend life or you know reduce the risk of one of those things is just sending me the summary and I think this kind of taxs into the longevity meta Trend um I think unlike Paton Drop Like Pon drop was very much run by advertising I think long live research is actually something that people would want to spend money on if it's done in a really high quality way I think there's a lot of money being spent on people trying to extend their life so having you know just in research kind of brought to you very quickly is something I think people would pay for um so yeah it's really just kind of applying that that thesis of you know get fragmented information bring it to people in a way that's relevant to them um and make money from that is is is the the play I'd be making this is this is probably my favorite idea that you dropped today just because it's it has the least amount of risk and it's the easiest to start and you know I've actually talked about this before that uh scientific papers have all so much good data in it but it's just hard to like break through so if you could to your point own the format um and I do really like the idea around you put in there's some input from you you know your own history you know that sort of thing I think um that personalization piece is going to get open rates up click-through rates up more engagement and yeah going back to monetization it's like who's spending the most amount of money right now it's people who are trying to live forever you know it's like the Brian Johnson Community is like who you want to Target um you know the don't die community and I think there's uh this is really similar I think this is a trend like this is a great Trend to be building in and uh I like it yeah I think also you know I was kind of testing it with Claude and just you know feeding it academic papers and just getting results and it's like yeah this is so much easier now with you know starting these ideas using Claude or chat GPT to kind of code an MVP is just so much easier to do today than it was like a few years ago so um I think these kinds of plays are uh are pretty a pretty easy to do okay one last idea what's Rock what kind of idea do we want do we want a weird idea or do we want um if you if you were trying to make a million dollars in the next 12 months which idea would you pick that's a great question I think the okay so I think besides the long live research which I think could be that million dollars within a year okay so the idea I would go for is have you heard of Sheila no I I thought you were just having like a stroke over there I so okay so you're having like a Joe Biden moment you know at the debate so I mean it's so funny because the name is algorithm breaking in itself yeah it just so um I I was uh I think I was listening to um uh Sam par and Sean talk about this um and um basically it's just this black tar ayurvedic medicine that has been going really viral on Tik Tok and it's basically just leveraging Tik Tok shop like crazy it's it's an algorithm breaking visual it's like black gooey stuff you've got videos of hundreds and thousands of influence influences just eating this black tar and you know it's just it's just um Then followed up with it boosts your testosterone it you know does all of these magical things and um it's doing really well I I forgot on the numbers exactly but you know I think tens of millions of dollars in Revenue uh in a very very short period of time for the company that is um selling she legit um so I think what I would do is um there is this other company in India called pangali and patang is an aavec company and it's huge like must be billions of dollars in Revenue it's just absolutely massive and um it's really tailored to the Indian market it's tailored to the Indian like Middle Market the designs look terrible they look medicinal but it's all the same stuff like they they sell like you know the equivalent of sheilaa they sell these other random juices and these other like aoic things and basically what I try to do is if um is if I i' just be running back the sheit thing with uh basically being a pund rapper I would take very ugly disgusting looking products um in India in the air EIC industry I would Spruce it up with a Cool brand or a brand that is still tied to like the mysticism of India but Western enough for people to kind of snap it up and I would hire a bunch of influencers using Tik Tok shop to go crazy and I would make sure that the packaging is viral you know is a algorithm breaking thing as well as the consumption of the product itself whether it's the colors just something about it needs to be extremely you know scroll stopping um and and then you know all of the health benefits are you know kind of well chronicled um and I think there's like this meta Trend too of you know there's like the Brian Johnson's of the world who are really leaning into medical Innovation and experimentation and then there are other people who are really like turning away from traditional from Modern Day medicine and looking towards traditional medicine as a means of like being pure and clean and healthy um so AIC medicine which is like an ancient Indian medicine kind of hits that specific demographic pretty well um so yeah I if I was trying to make a million dollars in a year is a little bit of you know capital and to be honest if I was to be really cheeky about it I would just buy I would buy the potentially products I wouldn't even try to get it made I just buy the products a design packaging and I would literally just put the product in this new packaging hire a bunch of influencers start making videos have my own website and just start selling those things and then if you're and then if you validate it okay cool let's actually like make this stuff properly with our own Factory and um and have people do this more you know um above board I have no idea about the league ity of actually doing that um but that that would be one play that I could make if I were to aggressively try to seek a million dollars within 12 months so yeah it's like why would you even try to build the product you know at first I mean isn't the move just to do the research for great products and then reach out to them and be like hey I want to White Label your product and try try to close those deals yeah I think that is definitely a better way of probably doing it um I think if you wanted to do it in a permissionless way um the the the products are um you know it's just especially like Indian bureaucracy it's just there's a lot of layers of fat to get through um but yeah that would be a much better play and I'm sure there are yeah I I haven't looked into the detail of that specific company but if you can white label it and especially if they're if you're going after a market that they're not capitalizing on you know like they're very much heavily focused on like Indians and the Indian diaspora possibly they're not really focused on like the Western Market so if you were to you know partner with them and be like hey look just give me the stuff that you're making and I'll take care of the rest in terms of actually making it palatable to the rest of this massive consumer Market um I'm sure there's a win-win for you and the distributor if you can build the trust and uh and go through that um go through that process well that's why I think having like a personal brand is probably helpful there that you're not just like some random person from the internet reaching out so maybe if you don't have a personal brand you haven't done this you haven't done that at least partner with someone who who has that so you can say like hey you know my co-founder is this person she has 100,000 followers in this space we love your product um I think white labeling probably makes more sense than acquiring first because quiring is just you don't know if it's going to work it's going to require more Capital so I'd love the idea of white labeling and I guess at the very worse you can go to them and be like hey listen I'll buy your products wholesale so you're just you know you're they're making money and if they're like no we we won't buy it wholesale it's like okay I'll buy your products retail um and and with all the brand work you're going to do and all the influencer work that you're going to do you'll be able to you know charge a lot for it um so I think it's interesting I I'm always wary of physical products um but uh it's it would probably be a fun like this is something like a fun week two weeks just to like explore and see if you're able to find these products reach out to them and uh yeah it doesn't take up too much capital right you just need like a uh a really dope brand color palette positioning uh and and and you're Off to the Races yeah this is definitely something that is outside of my zone of expertise but I think for someone who has done this kind of play with physical Goods I think they could probably kill it um and especially I really like the idea of partnering with a Tik Tok influencer who's already got that distribution baked in like if you can find you know who's like not the next hubman but you know like a notch below or a few notches below and kind of talking about similar things you know that just der risks a lot of it and also you know if you're like an operator or you're an entrepreneur um and you're basically saying hey look let's go 50/50 on this I'll take care of everything you just do the marketing and the distribution and just kind of pump this out I'm seeing a lot more startups and businesses uh going down that route and I think it's a really solid route because going back to what we've been discussing today as well just distribution is so important and being able to break through is so important it's really hard to get people's attention so anything you can do to you know minimize the risk involved with not getting attention is is always helpful and that's where we're going to end it cuz uh I totally agree near I had high hopes for this podcast and you obviously overd delivered I love these ideas you're criminally underf followed I think you have like 5,000 x followers so where could where could people find you and get more of you yeah just um follow me on this is near on X and yeah just uh that's where I normally [ __ ] post a lot of random ideas I love it keep doing it and and if you made it this far comment in on on YouTube will be in the comments replying looking around like on YouTube and uh and share this with a friend share these ideas with a friend you might find a co-founder um or they might tell you that these ideas are dumb and that's a whole you know that's maybe what you need to hear so thank you n this has been real and I'll catch you later thanks [Music] with [Music]

so first off bluecollar startups all the sweaty startup people are always going off about how these businesses are the best businesses to start in reality like what they never do is show you actually how to grow them so that's what I want to talk about today so each of these things are approachable you can go get started with these businesses for like 150 bucks at your your Lowe's or Home Depot or whatever you know your Ace Hardware is right next to you yeah I I think it's one of these ideas that's like very deceptive when you look at it like you're like oh this is just some simple dumb lifestyle business but in reality like the game here is you go and you make this service business this sweaty startup or whatever the hell you want to call it and then you learn these skill sets on how to Market this type of business you turn that into an agency create this cash flow so that then I can go and I want to buy portions of these companies in specific geographies so just thinking about this over 7 to 10 year period of of of climbing this ladder when you scale this up what this evolves into is when you own portions of these companies this can turn into an unbelievable whole like portfolio company that whole thing that I'm talking about there is just basically like how you can go from like baby entrepreneur to okay you're playing at the pro level with the big dogs [Music] right got to stretch it out dude you got to stretch it out you need you need the intro music we have to figure out how to do this I want like sip you know the Sip theme song playing as you're waiting in the waiting room but when Cody Schneider comes on it's like sipping time baby like exactly exactly I wanted like deep house techno like techno bunker style you think you're out of like late 90s Rave that's what we're going for so anyway Cody Schneider you're back you're ready to sit you got a lot of blue collar ideas and some blue collar I want to I want to rip on those first cuz it's driving me crazy everybody always talks about how easy it is to start these businesses and then they never actually show you how to do this and it's actually so easy so anyways I want to go there and then we can dive into there's a bunch of random stuff on that list that we got but it's going to level up from like you know really approachable stuff into stuff that's you know kind of even out of my my my range of of expertise or skill set so far so should we do it let's do it hell yeah all right so first off Blue Collar startups all the sweaty startup people are always going off about how these businesses are the best businesses to start in reality like what they never do is show you actually how to grow them so that's what I want to talk about today so the three I'm going to use as an example is going to be uh uh going to be window cleaning it's going to be power washing and it's going to be lawnmowing and the reason for this is because you want to do something that neighbors can physically see looks different on the structure next to them because you can use that as a selling like a leverage point to go sell the whole neighborhood on that thing thing so again each of these things are approachable you can go get started with these businesses for like 150 bucks at your Lowe's or Home Depot or whatever you know your Ace Hardware is right next to you and then to actually get customers I want to walk through the options that are here with this so if you want to get like sophisticated with this what it ends up looking like is you basically optimize a Google my business profile listing so with that listing how you actually optimize that is you basically set up you're going to need an address of some type you can do a PO Box the best way is have some type of physical address you can just tack it onto another business so if you have a family member or something like that that's the best way to do this and then you what you're going to then go do is you build citations for that business so business citations what these are basically uh websites that are like business directory websites if you go to fiverr.com Just Google you know just search in Fiverr like business citations you're G to find a guy you're G to pay him 30 bucks and he's going to make 300 citations for you the reason we're doing this is when your business information uh Mt whatever you put on Google you want to use that exact thing that you're on all the citations when all that matches Google looks at that as a trust metric and this is actually how you can rank within the snack pack which is the three when you go and you Google something for anything local Services what shows up on page one is at the top of most these pages is it's going to be three Google Maps listings so how do you rank with in that Google Maps listing so you come up as one of those three this is the way to do that so you build all these citations Google's going to be like oh here's all these websites where it's all matching so there's a trust that's built into that uh again reviews are going to be a component of this we found it to be less and less important to do reviews what really matters is that the keyword phrases that you want to come up for being in the listing you can just have ai write this go f find like all the keywords related to whatever the service that you're providing so like Window Cleaning Denver Window clean you know whatever the service area is all the different variations and you basically have it right um a description of that uh of that business including those keywords and add that to the Google my business profile listing I've even done this where I've St I've just keyword stuffed these listings before like like straight up listed out 30 different keywords and got it to rank for that as long as you're again building these citations out right um so that's how you can get inbound leads from the Google Maps side then the other thing that I would do if I was running this just on that real quick yeah so when you say AI I get AI to write this okay which Ai and how do you prompt it so I would do something like chat I would go to chat GPT or Claude I'm really liking Claude lately it's just way more human on the outputs that it's doing you give it the list of keywords that you're trying to have it write for and you say hey write me uh a thwp of a business and you know name your company whatever that is and include these keywords in that output super simple all it's going to do then is it's just going to write this article or write this description this business description that includes all those keywords phrases in it but it's going to feel natural it's going to feel like it's you know you're not just listing out the keywords like I said I like we've done a test although that works this is going to be a more effective way to do that um so that that's kind of the the breakdown of this of how I would go about and do that and then all of those keywords you also want to include them in the uh in the service offering there's a section within the Google my business listing where you can like just list out the services that you offer those same keywords include those there and that's going to help on the ranking side and then images is the other component of it that we found to be really important reviews are way lower than people think it's honestly shocking um especially in uh like smaller geographies it really what's matters is like is this an exact match for whatever this person is searching and is there more business information that I can find off off of off of Google basically that's supporting that this is an actual company that does this service that's in this location and here's you know its phone number information that type of thing um and again all of this is like you you know you could use a Google business phone number um real phone numbers are more effective is what we found if you can get you know even a cell phone and have that be the one that you're linked up to or use you know one of these like VoIP softwares that'll work as well any of those types of tools but basically that's kind of you know to take a step back and run down through this whole thing of how you optimize these profiles it's you want to find the keywords that you're trying to show up for that when you Google them right now from wherever you are that map pack shows up on that front page right um quick ad break let me tell you about a business I invested in it's called boring marketing.com so a few years ago I met this group of people that were some of the best SEO experts in the world they were behind getting some of the biggest companies found on Google and the secret sauce is they've got a set of technology and AI that could help you outrank your competition so for my own businesses I wanted that I didn't want have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I didn't want to depend on ads to drive customers to my businesses I wanted to rank high in Google that's why I like SEO and that's why I use boring marketing.com and that's why I invested in it they're so confident in their approach that they offer a 30-day Sprint with 100% money back guarantee who does that nowadays so check it out highly recommend boring marketing.com so if the answer is yes so it's like you found a keyword it shows that map pack then green light that keyword you're going to include that in the description of the listing you're going to include that in the offering it's like this like you know what you do and the services you offer section include that there as well whatever your high highest Target level keyword is you can also include that in the listing title there's a little bit gray area this is not technically like you're not supposed to do this but it can help with your ranking um so what I would suggest is whatever you name this business name it with that exact keyword in it so again saying you're doing window cleaning like try to get it as close to like Denver Window Cleaning company as possible right um have you ever seen that uh that Meme and it's like TI near me it's like this restaurant named TI near me so that the reason they're doing that is they're trying to basically like TI near me is a huge uh traffic keyword right and so they're trying to show up for that when somebody searches it in you know whatever City that it's in so you're basically using that same strategy here and then so that's how you optimize the listing and you know to use SEO terms that's on page optimization and then the off pages and taking that exact data that you use to fill out that listing the phone number the address uh the the business title Etc and you go and you build all these citations out those listing citations um so that's kind of layer one of this the next layer down from that is then you have to go and get those citations to actually be seen by Google so what you can use is you can use an indexing bot um I'll I'll I'll share the the link uh that I have for this one I I'm the one I'm liking right now is I think it's called like Speedy indexer it's literally a telegram bot that's the only way you can get access to it um but you give the list of citations that that person that you just bought this off Fiverr that they built and you send it to this bot and it will go and it will index the it basically what it does is it drips traffic into these uh these these pages and the reason we have to do this is because these citation websites are massive right we're talking about like hundreds of millions of pages sometimes and so Google doesn't a lot enough crawl budget to actually go and see the entire website and so what that we do is we're basically like sending pings to this specific URL and this company handles this for you and it's super cheap I'm talking like you know a couple cents per per listing that you're doing like right like you can this whole thing I'm talking about you can do for under probably you know $300 you can get started with this entire company and so once you've done that uh it's Google's going to see them it's GNA the indexing boock will show you which ones have been indexed and then it'll do about 50% it's just hit or miss that's how it is it doesn't work always right with all these things so then that that uh so say it gets you know 100 on the first go whatever that 200 is that left you just run it again you run it indefinitely until all of these start to hit um so that's another component of this if you do that you're miles ahead of the people that you're competing against in the space and then the thing that you can go further with if you want to is you then take the Google Maps uh listing and you can embed that listing and so this is something that Google prioritizes as being uh a a like if somebody embeds that then it's like a good it's basically a signal that this is like a good resource right think about when somebody embeds a YouTube video when they embed a map Etc the it it's a signaled off the page that this is a again another real company so you can use the service it's called um oh God what's his name Kevin pbn's if you just Google it this website called Black Hat World Is Gonna Come up do not take any other advice off of Black Hat World and if this is like the sophisticated level of this that's a layer down and again this is like I would only go here if you if it's entirely necessary and you're trying to compete in like a very competitive market most of the time I was wondering what you're going to say about that yes so with all that said um what you can do is you basically can embed the Google Maps listing on this pbn network so what a pbn network is is it's called a plot private blog Network and a private blog Network imagine it's like thousands of blogs that this company owns that all internally link back to each other and all basically like kind of juicing themselves up so this be used to be a way that you could like rank you know things previously this was years ago now how people use them is they use them as like a tier two or a tier three link so what this means is uh they're basically you you build your backlink and then you build links from other sites to the back link that you built so that it gets seen this is another way to see get those those sites indexed um if you're trying to not do the Speedy index spot but again that works so effectively you don't need to do that but to get back to this so then you embed that uh uh that Google Maps Lis thing and then include the business information there as well and you can again get these for like you know I think 50 cents to get these these P these published and basically these these uh pbn articles made that includes this embedded in the WordPress site and that's another way for you to get these and but I mean I've seen case studies and Shout Out Jackie uh Jackie chow or Jew I can't remember is last name or how to pronounce it correctly so I'm totally butchering that but he's just done unreal case studies on this type of stuff um and a lot of what I just talked about are methods that he's basically like kind of pioneered or shown out in public and then we've used it on companies that we've uh that you know I work my brother's in the medical space we do a bunch of stuff with like you know local business type of deal and this is the things that we've seen be effective and it's really just ripping off of a lot of what he's doing already so um but yeah man that whole Playbook is like you just gamed Google Maps and you now have or organic inbound leads and the results from this type of work like we've seen it in like a week and a half go from Like It's Not In That Snack Pack to it's in that snack pack when you do this type of work it's like I mean I couldn't get that to happen in SEO if I tried right you know the time Horizons on traditional SEO to rank on the front page is like at least three months plus like even if the site uh is like has some Authority and has some U uh uh you know it's that company has existed in that Community for a long time but this is a way to really quickly go and do that so yeah and go ahead yeah and once you once you do that and you've done it like you can point to success you can do it for other companies too right that's exactly where I'm leading with all this so like the the the game here is you go and you make this service business the sweaty startup or whatever the hell you want to call it and then you learn these skill sets on how to Market this type of business you turn that into an agency and then you go and you cold email every you know Window Cleaning company in the US hey they're like hey Window Cleaning company like I know how to grow and get leads like let's do a part you know I want to do marketing for you here's some sat like set flat fee here's all the things that we're going to do you could even do it on a performance basis there's all these different models to do that um but before we jump in kind of to the next phase there's two other things I want to talk about just things that we've seen work and I think could be really effective for these businesses so the other one is uh direct mail so you can use this company called lob.com and what lob.com will do is like you build a flyer it's a it's going to be an 11 uh by8 flyer um in uh you do it in canva I think that's the dimensions don't quote me on that but basically build that out on canva you can upload that into lob and then you can upload a list of addresses that you trying to send this direct mail out to and what the addresses you can go and uh if you just search like addresses and XYZ zip code find the find the richest ZIP codes in your area and that's where you want to send these two and offer that service to right um so there's a direct mail play here and then the other thing that you can also uh do is uh I mean straight up just like putting flyers on doors is going to be like another piece of this just like old school classic and I'm talking from like you're starting out from zero and you're trying to figure out like how do I get this to make me a 100K a year and be my own boss this is the this is all the things that I would layer on together and again this isn't a super uh heavy lift to do all of this this is all like very accessible and and you know most people could do this so um but anyways so you got this company it's established now and you're like all right I know how to do this marketing none of these other people know how to do these marketing but they have businesses that are 15 years old 20 years old that are in this space so now you go out and you say hey we do digital marketing for these people you basically make an agency a digital agency and you do some type of service fee that's how I would do it because it would be a cash I'm just trying to create cash flow and the reason for that will come up in a second so I'm trying to create this cash flow so that then I can go and I want to buy portions of these companies in specific geographies say you go and you be like hey I want to buy 20% of your company and we're g to handle all of your marketing for you so you spend this upfront cost and you use the cash flow from your agency and you use the cash flow you know from your window cleaning company that you built initially so you just thinking about this over whatever sevene period 7 to 10 year period of of of climbing this ladder well this evolves into is when you own portions of these companies and you have all these geographies that you're servicing and say you have owned 20% of a you know a window cleaning company or an hvat company or whatever this ends up being this can turn into an unbelievable hold like portfolio company like Holdings company an example of somebody that's done this his name is James zly he's this guy out of the UK absolute gangster like just a legend he's like a degenerate Gambler too so I love him he like bets on horse racing and owns horses and breeds them it's so sick like that is the dream literally my dream is that so anyway um he he's done this where he basically goes in he buys a portions of these companies and over a three-year period I mean they can basically double or triple these these things right so when you think about from an investment standpoint like he has the same Playbook he's running over and over again it's the same skill sets it's the same team members he doesn't have to change any of that all he's doing is he's just running those same plays in these different places and that's how I mean he he's an SEO guy he's an guy a legit OG like classic yeah totally but I mean he's worth like 100 million allegedly from a portfolio standpoint the only thing I would do differently here would be I I probably wouldn't buy 20% of these businesses with cash like I would just earn that Equity kind of seller financed and be like yeah I'm not going to charge you for all these Services I'm you know but I'm going to I'm going to do these things for you and like maybe put some cash down but you know I think that's a way to do it totally and there's so many different ways that you can handle it the biggest problem is getting the cash flow so that you have the leverage and the skill set so you have that leverage and that's like what that whole thing that I'm talking about there is just basically like how you can go from like baby entrepreneur to okay you're playing at the pro level with the big dogs right and that again it's like you could that that whole model that we just talked about that's a three to five year Sprint that if you really wanted to and you were like ready to grind like you could do that whole thing what we just described and the other thing that I would do and layer on top of this I know you'll love this is I would film I would do these services that you can film that are like satisfying and then you put those on YouTube and that turns into another Revenue stream for you long term right so like have you seen the guys that like mow like Lawns they like take like nasty ass Lawns and they like trim them all up and then they I mean they get like three million views right same thing you do with window cleaning you could do it with uh you could do it with power washing like there's the massive channels out there and so you just thinking about that layer so that does two things it's like that turns into a profit Center for you because you're going to get adds you know add dollars off of that but simultaneously you're gonna also get inbound leads from that because they're going to show people that are in that geography like if you lifts that in the description like cleaning a you know or mowing a lawn in you know blah blah blah South Carolina like it's gonna it's going to show that to people that are in that geography it's going to understand that over time and that's that's kind of the data the other other layer of this here that we you can you can play into so is it not her Alex Herm mozies a little bit because I mean right he did the only thing I think that's missing a little bit from this story is what he did with uh what's it called gym gym launch gym launch so he was like yeah I had this gym and I you know grew it from X to Y like I think the personal Brand Story is really like huge with this you have to be able to say I'm one of you I did to and I took it from A to B and then invest in content at that layer 100% 100% I mean we've talked about this on other episodes where it's like hey you go and you uh create YouTube videos showing people how to do this right like how to do Google ads for window cleaning or whatever right or how to do Facebook ads for window cleaning or how to even just we what we just talked about on Google Maps like how to rank your window cleaning business for Google mape what's naturally going to happen people are going to watch this they're going to be like oh my God I don't have time for this like can I just hire this kid boom that turns into your first customer but again using yourself as the case study is always the most effective way to do this right it's like we did this for my company that I owned and here's the results we can do this for your company that you own and like we the idea is we can basically expect results that are similar it's super simple idea right um but it looks very I I think it's one of these ideas that's like very deceptive when you look at it like you're like oh this is just some simple dumb lifestyle business but in reality like when you scale this up and you look at the path of like where people and and and horos is doing this exact same right thing right he's like cool I built these like he's now at that level where he's investing in other companies like his investment in school is an ex perfect example of this where it's like he's like oh well I leveled up to these to these layers and now I'm at this you know Pro level which is where I buy portions of these other companies and then I use my platform that I built to basically go and promote this right I mean it's the same it's the same thing you're doing it's the same thing I'm doing it's the same Playbook but in then totally different category I like it I like it how big of an opportunity is this I mean just to use James as an example like I again if if he owns for my from what I've seen he owns about 150 different companies equity in 150 different company I think he he goes after specific categories and then he uh you know for each G major geography or each major metro area he Partners or buys a percentage of some company and he always goes with some Scrappy upstart you know some dude that's in his late that's got two kids that's like there to grind right he's like cool I'm gonna like help we're going to help you double triple your business over the next two to three years and I mean I think this is 100% aund hundred million dollar company especially when you look at like what are I mean these companies sell for a lot of money especially if they have uh a foothold within an area right if that an hbac company's been in an area for 20 years right like there's Equity there's just name brand equity in that over time so when you go and you try to sell that to PE or whatever or you just go and you do a bundle right there's probably a version of that as well where you sell the percentages of each of these companies uh that that you have that you have in your Holdings company that or that hold that that Holdings company owns So before we move to the next idea I don't know if you saw this but Cody Sanchez bought a piece of uh resi Brands I didn't see this no way yeah yeah so resi Brands is like you know I think it's the fastest growing painting comp painting franchise company in theed unit States insane they also own pinks which is just killer pinks is what you were talking about a little bit Austin Austin yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so they're like visual like it looks like these guys dude I have friends that wear to streetwear like I mean exactly right yeah it's like 80s it kind of looks like an 80s like porno ' 80s is backing look at the top Billboard right now and it's all synth every song is leading with syn it's synth or it's folk that's the only thing that's happening right now or Kendrick that's the outlier the only outlier in that whole list but anyway sorry I didn't mean to cut you off but I it's related I mean it totally related I think so so basically the idea is they took uh window cleaning but they they wear these like I don't know it's like 80s porn mustache guys cleaning it and it's so Tik Tok friendly so Cody you see him in a calendar yeah so Cody say I would buy a calendar 100% Cody uh Sanchez ended up buying a big piece of the business what do you think about that I think it's brilliant um I think the only thing that I would be against with this type of stuff is like I love when influencers buy companies that they have some type of distribution Advantage with so when they have an Arbitrage that nobody else has access to and maybe she does have that and we don't know about it like again I I have no idea but um her audience of like entrepreneurs doesn't feel totally aligned unless she goes and she's like yo I'm going to franchise this thing and then I just use my audience as the way to basically spin up you know we take the the we take the business I mean and that's honestly probably the angle that I would go at this room like if I was in that position is okay we got 30 different locations right now like how do we turn that into 300 locations in the next three years and then that's when you go and you approach traditional PE and I mean you just have an absolutely massive exit right um that's probably the bridge like they just take the same marketing and they're just trying get like a ton of top of funnel inbound of people that want to start you know business in a box companies and this feels like a business in a box company but I I would say this like if you ever see a brand that people are repping that the product is unrelated like the clothing is unrelated to the brand that's when you know that that company is absolutely like going to rip in whatever category it's in when you when you you can't you can't fabricate that it only happens like organically and you it only happens when you're doing something cool and original that like really people that are on the front of that that adoption curve are like oh yo like this is this is something I like again I have a friend who's uh he's in the podcasting space and like this is how I know about this and like he reps the merch like to your point right like just wearing it out because that this it's the stylization on it is insane right and th that when you think about that and and you see any company that that's naturally happening immediately go okay that's that's like a business that you want to try try to buy into they're doing something right you don't you don't even have to know what it is it's just a signal that this is this is a good thing 100% all right what else you got cool um have you heard of uh the uh buy it for life subreddit tell tell me about it okay so I stumbled on this thing and basically what it is is there's this group of people that want to buy products that they're tired of consumerism and they want to buy products that are like the highest quality they can you know at you know doesn't really matter the price I want this thing to last for forever and so massive subreddit insanely fast how it's growing like if you look at the data um and all that people do is they basically are like hey I'm trying to get like the best jacket for x or like these types of boots right like Doc Martins that are actually good quality what is the brand that I should go after and look for and this subreddit is just dedicated to that so it's all it is is people basically like question and answering what is the best of XYZ category like I was just look how I stumbled on it it's I was looking for the best blender right CU I was like I bought so many blenders over my life I mean I'm I'm I can't take it anymore like I want one like what is it what is it gonna take to give me one so they suggested uh it was basically this like industrial blender and I was like oh my God this is like you read the reviews on this and they're like yo I've had this for 80 years right like I got I just got to pass down you know my my mom just passed it down to me type of thing and so I think there's this whole subset of people and what's interesting is all these people look like they have money because the products are not small price taxs right we're talking about like you know $800 P like pairs of boots right like that type of deal and you know I mean this blender was like two grand right but I think there's an angle here and I actually don't know what this company looks like and that's what I want to throw out and you know to you and like like have you kind of we can uh we can rally off of it but um I I think there's an angle where you do like a imagine like a William Sonoma bu for Life stumble upon crossover so you just like are swiping through this and you're like discovering all of these products that are like the highest Echelon of their category that they're in so I think that's an angle of this and I think you could probably pair that with like a deal monitor for these brands that are considered buy it for life Brands right so you go and you scrape that subreddit you find all of the buy it for life Brands and then you basically I I know there's these websites that exist uh I I don't have a lot of experience in this so you know bear with me for my ignorance but you can basically set up monitors for these types of products so that whenever deals come on the market for you know ex it's really just probably like Google Trends is how a lot of this is happening but whenever or not Google Trends uh Google like notifications or Google news or how you can set up like a listener and then anytime that you see a price drop then that site it goes up on there you basically scrape it just probably an affiliate play that's there and there's probably a subscription on top of it because these people want to buy these Goods but they're looking for oh it's 30% off like these boots I've been looking for 30% off let me go buy that so anyways I'll throw the mic to you I'm curious your thoughts I mean this is this isn't just any subreddit this this is probably one of the fastest growing subreddits I think it has 2.3 million members so this is this is just like a macro Trend around people are just tired of buying things that break totally so I love the macro Trend you know what does it look like I don't know I think that there's probably like it would be really cool if there was you know if I bought you know I almost like a Costco membership but for buy it for life it's like $100 a year I get access to these amazing products all these products and if one of these products breaks we will you know not only buy you know lifetime guarantee but we'll we'll give 20 of them to you know if it's a sweater we'll give 20 sweaters to you know uh people who you know need sweaters you know and if it's a blender we'll send 20 you know 20 blenders to U you know soup kitchen that sort of thing totally totally so there's some type of like uh you know Community or some type of I don't know social cause that's tied into it dude I think that's brilliant I mean it is probably just taking the Costco model right and then you just turn into like you're just a Marketplace distributor and I I mean let's just do the math real quick right so say you had 10,000 people that were subed to this it's 100 $ a year and so you're coming out what is that a million um so you're coming out at a million in in uh in revenues uh then you go and you negotiate relationships you probably have to get it at a way larger scale uh probably be like a 100,000 but again if there's 2.2 million people that are a part of this just imagine getting 10% of those people on this list so you're coming in at 220,000 people so you get 220,000 people they're paying you a 100 a year uh so that's going to be 22 million um no 200 20 million is that right I think so no public math yeah 220 million and at that point you go to these companies and you negotiate buys based on that right you just have like a narly division that that focuses on this but I to zoom out to the macr trend thing like I think this is something that people are getting obsessed with like how do I buy a knife that will last me for 20 years like how do I buy you know everything in my home like I I I'm so tired of things breaking like even when it's considered decent quality and the first two years of its existence and I it's funny because the the next company that I'm going to pitch you is basically this it's it's related to this it's in the same vein but an entirely different category but I like this I like your idea of the membership thing I think that this is actually the way that this would be the most profitable and you just pass on the savings to the people how you actually make money is based off the memberships so can I pitch you uh pit you an idea real quick that I have before this call so I've been into this going to sound like dumbb but I've been into reading recently reading hell yeah yeah hell yeah I can't read so it's you know whenever I hear that from somebody I'm always very I I I I look fondly at it there you go so I've been enjoying books and uh I've I've been like whenever I hear someone recommend a book that you know maybe on a podcast or YouTube video I always write it down instantly actually I just instantly buy it and after point I I finished all those books so I would say let's say I'm a big Cody Schneider fan which I am by the way I would I would go to chat gbt and I say you know here's Cody Schneider this is who he is here's his link to his Twitter what are the five mustre books that Cody Schneider would recommend to me I'm looking I'm looking to get better at XYZ topic SEO organic marketing whatever so I think that there's an opportunity to basically create uh I guess it's like a newsletter and it's like books that XYZ influencer would recommend and it's I don't know if it's weekly or monthly but call let's just say it's probably a book club what if it's that where it's like you pay a subscription and then you're going and basically CU like I I want this like you tell me like what are the top most influential books for this person that's in my category like right we do business for a living like I want to know every book that every business person has ever referenced and influenced their career and like I want to read that book right because that's that's the idea behind this um I I mean I book clubs are already happening it's just a Different Twist on it so I 100% there's something in this yeah but I think with book clubs what you know what a book club I don't think it's a book club sorry I mean like a like you get like a box you know just like those snack pack boxes like I just want like cool like four books show up month you know day one of the month and it's like this month we're highlighting you know XYZ person the reason we're highlighting them is because they did ABC they're experts at you know one two and three and these are the books that they said were most influential within their career and then boom you know you have that those physical copies right there you don't have to think about it and it's like I mean you could probably do it in like different categories too like oh I want to do art history or you know I'm obsessed with so stupid but with like Roman history right now I'm just like binging this podcast from like it's the history of Rome it's the best podcast dude it's just this dude like you can tell just passion project obsessed with it he's just reading off the facts then he's like yeah and that guy was a [ __ ] idiot it's iconic but anyway um like I'm just imagining like that that's something that I think when I when I don't have to think about it but I get the the educational drip that I'm looking for I think that's valuable to anybody right that's like competing at at a high level they want to know everything about everybody they're competing against or has competed in the same category before them yeah and I also think that if if it's uh influencer based or Creator based you just Target people that you know if it's for me let's say yeah people who follow me on on X just 100% get those people I'm sure you can get those emails for like pretty cheap and then and then just send them like I think there you know businesses have levels so like level one of this is just the free email with like Greg Eisenberg would recommend these two books this month and here's some key insights for from those books and then Le you know the next level is join the book club to your point Y and it's like you don't even have to you know for $99 a month we'll just send it to you right away and then next level is maybe a membership that you know uh you know synchronous events and digital stuff that's the business 100% no I think it's brilliant I again it's just I'm like you where it's like I as soon as I hear a book that somebody mentions I just like yeah I mean that could be a feature of this too right is like you go and you scrape everything of that they've ever been on or talked on and like cool what is the things that they've mentioned based off these transcripts because like they people I feel like every interview that I besides this one that I go on it's like what books would you recommend or like what are you listening to like that type of [ __ ] and I mean just extract that out of there you know just do R over the top of it even if you haven't explicitly recommended the book you can infer based on all the stuff that you've talked about all the people that you've talked about all the super interesting all that stuff you like it I love that yeah I green light I think that that's another one it's super simple too it's just you can use off the off the the Shelf Tech and I think the distribution is exactly what you said like choose these figures that are already in public like hberman or whatever right it could be anybody any of these any anybody that's in any category so and then you're also making affiliate on Amazon what is exactly let's see yeah how much uh% I think is for books yeah I mean M just great I mean it's it's an unreal so and again I think there's layers of it too right it's like build big list people typically people who read have a higher income level that's the trend shocking um so then you have an audience and the so you have the audience so you sell ad space on that you have the Affiliates of the books sorry on the I'm still on the big Insight that you gave that people who have who read have a higher uh income level dude it's so stupid but so real it's it's crazy actually uh there there's like a direct correlation in relationship to this rather than listening to things like they often people that don't listen to things and who read more have more money to spend it's their filter it's so weird it's it's you the economic data around it is actually wild so but um all right to move on yes uh dumb appliances all right so I have a dishwasher and it takes me seven button clicks to make it go and it every time I do it I hate doing the dishes because of it I despise doing the dishes because of it and I think this is a larger Trend and the data shows this as well like again go to Reddit and look for people being like what's the dumbest dishwasher that I can find what's the dumbest Wasing machine that I can find what's the dumbest fridge that I can find and again I think this is a push back from it's a part of that larger trend of people just want things that last they want things that they can fix and they can work on and I think there's an opportunity I would literally just call it dumb appliances and your whole thing is like we don't connect to the internet we don't like it just works it's like maybe four buttons to that's the whole thing of of the whatever the minimum amount is to to get the thing to function it does that right and I think there's a huge opportunity and I think I would just sell it like that like we built the dumbest dishwasher like you plug it in and it runs like that's it right like and that's the angle that you go from you talk about Simplicity you talk about it lasting for a long time you buy it for life type of deal and I think there's an opportunity to build a brand uh in that space and then I mean I think the larger Trend here is like do you see that story where like some dude was like mining Bitcoin off of the fridge like the CP like off of the the the processor that was was in his fridge like they like hacked his fridge and was like mining Bitcoin off it he's like I couldn't figure out why my bandwidth on my network was so high like he's like I there's no way we're using you know whatever it was some insane amount of data and then they found that this was the reason and I think everybody's like I don't need this to be connected to the internet I don't want to chat with my fridge my fridge to tell me what to do like the last thing people want is for a robot to tell them what to do like think about when your seat belt alarm goes off like you hate your car when it does that to you right now scale that up to your fridge telling you oh you need milk or whatever or scale that up to AI when it's like you can't ask that question like that's not all right like people are going to get pissed you want to know how to Red Pill people tell them that they can't research the thing or learn about the thing that they're trying to learn so anyways to take a step back I think there's an opportunity for dumb appliances just in every category within within the home I love it I want to show you a quick tweet I saw today uh shilman note my parents have had the same washer and dryer for almost my entire life they bought them used in 1989 35 years without issue I've had to replace our washer twice in the nine years that I've had it they really don't make them like they used to and it's these like boxy I guess General Electric it looks like or mayag and then Nikita said Nikita beer you can still buy them new it'll cost you two times the price of the most expensive LG but they're totally worth it 100% And I think that's the larger Trend that's happening right is like especially the the anybody that has basically disposable income they're trying to they're thinking about these things and they just want that quality level at the highest level that they can get it if you can be the source for that in any form you're going to get that customer loyalty and then again you can just move throughout the house like start with one just everybody that you talk to has had this experience with a washing machine like the Samsung like it doesn't dry [ __ ] because the sensor's off of like when it's dry right and so I'm having to dry having to time dry it over and over again but it auto turns itself off because it's saying that it's dry but it's not it's damp I put my hand in and it's damp I think for a lot of people that's that's a huge frustration and so if you come to that and you solve that problem like there's a massive Market that you can go after and I think it could be very cool like calling it dumb Appliance or stupid appliances or you know there's some name that's like in there that would uh tap into that frustration that anger that people people have with these okay before you go into your next idea I want to I want to give a a dumb a dumb idea based on this so I saw a a Tik Tok of like some like 19 maybe 1980 Something Honda Civic that had like never been drived and it it sold for like a ton of money because it had like 10 miles on it or something and honestly I was looking at I was looking at it and I was like this is the most beautiful car I've ever seen so I think one of the one of the the D you know dumb appliance company ideas is you create a new car company no screens analog all knobs th% you call it you call it knobs or something 100% yeah 100% have you seen the light phone this is this larger Trend that's happening where like people are like yo I don't want all the sophistication like I want the minimum that gets the job done like all of the there it feels like bloat so much bloat has happened and I really I think what this is in response to is the inflation and what's going on like always what this does is there's a contraction that naturally occurs after like a growth period And I think that this is the response like this is where people are coming from with it where they're like you I just want if my phone just did GPS I could text I could call I could do notes and maybe I can read on it like I don't want anything else like I don't want I don't want Instagram I don't want it tracking me God knows what's happening with Tik Tok and so I think that again like to exactly to your point like a dumb car like a knobs car right and you just make it so you can work on it I mean we have this uh we have this 1980 Chevy square body it's just like baby blue it's a four-cylinder and the thing is just like it's the easiest engine that you could ever work on right and that thing like if it breaks we can just fix it just at home like you don't there's no there's like there's no computers in it there's none of that right and I think that there's this segment of people that are growing that want that that want these types of these types of products they're pushing back against uh uh you know the what's happening from a modern like just just the technology that's being built into this that feels like fluff it doesn't feel like it's adding value to what the goal is of people trying to accomplish with this tool right it's like I just want my clothes washed like I don't that's it right like I just want my car to get me from A to B and I think there's this whole subset of people and again I think a lot of the times they have money so that's why you could sell and make these kind of Boutique brands in these spaces so yeah and I think it's people want to go from point A to point B but it's also people want these devices to be sacred so if everything has a screen on it you're just constantly being overwhelmed and distracted so the idea that you can hop into a 1987 whatever Honda Civic and but it's pristine and there's not and there's no knobs you know you don't need Google Maps you're just like you're going for like a Sunday drive you know what I mean like there's there isn't there isn't a hundred you know Serious XM radio stations right like there's you only put in like one channel and it's Jazz yes you know totally that's it totally totally you're like intentionally limiting yourself and like through that finding like you know peace or whatever or whatever that that thing is that we're all searching for and never can find so um I I have a question for you how much would you pay a year to not ever see marketing um you're asking the wrong guy because I'm probably like you like I was watching only see marketing that you like uh if you had some way to filter and I'm saying like a hypothetical I don't know how you'd actually do this a year yeah yeah I would go in that I'd go up to 20 probably of just only seeing to to choose when I see marketing and the marketing is filtered for what I really love I would I would 100% I would pay money not to see it yeah I think that that that is a part of the screen thing we're talking about I'm even thinking about this like how do I have as few of screens everywhere like in my space because it's so much time is spent on it now and again we work in this digital space right so like that's why like it's a it's a it's a tool that we can use but like you can find yourself just so often being just sucked into this thing and it happens with every device now so cool next one next one let's rock let's do it all right um so print on demand mockup business right so print on demand for the people that are uninitiated is basically they have all these products and you sell them and then they manufacture and ship them started out in the apparel space that's the only reason I know about it because I spent a lot of time here in another life and what you basically could do is like build thousands of different variations of Graphics out you could put them on all these different skews of t-shirts sweatshirts you know anything and then this company basically when you sell it uh you on you know through your website or whatever they manufacture it and then they ship it out but it looks like it's coming from you it's it basically functions as kind of like a 3pl as well so the opportunity here so the the print on demand uh Market side is about 6.8 billion um so it's growing at a like I think it's like 18% compounding year-over-year so growing super quickly which is crazy when you think about it the opportunity I think right now for somebody is uh go and you basically make mockups of the print on demand products and people are already doing this traditionally like a photographer they would go and they'd shoot you know these super aesthetic like basically of whatever of whatever skew that that they're trying to sell right and there's all these it that are the most popular you can literally go to you know printify or any of these print on demand sites and sort by most popular you'll see which of the items sell most often right so here's the angle though in the AI AG if I go and I prompt mid Journey make me an image you know blah blah blah aesthetic here's the setting the whole thing but make them wearing a Gildan 2000 shirt which is a skew it's going to know what that is we've done this because it trained itself off of all these images that say Gildan 2000 in it right so it understands what that is so there's this opportunity here I think to basically go and just like we were talking with the Cricut idea same strategy Target people with a print on demand interest you make them where it's like a a drop pack of like you know here's a 100 or you know 50 different mockups of the Gildan 2000 shirt but you have every variation and you can go and find these keywords if you just do Gildan mockup right you're going to find all these variations on like semrush or ahr um and from that I think you could build out the same type of company it's just like an unlimited subscription they get access to these constantly you're constantly updating it and just running it and then as new skews drop or whatever you just go and you refresh that and then as the Aesthetics change you go and you refresh that Etc and probably the angle that I would think about this with is like go to something like Etsy or any of these like you know these print on demand shops you can find them all over find which the which are the bestselling products and the aesthetic that that product has currently right so maybe it's like boho or whatever right drop that into an AI and you be like defined how this image looks it lists out okay here's the aesthetic whatever and then you're like okay cool I'm going to go generate all these mockups now the layer up from this is then you build a mockup generator so you have all these images of Gildan 2000s that are in a boho style and you're like cool like I just built this graphic that I want to be that to have go on top of that and you basically have it where it's like you know you you you've designated this space where it's like we're going to you know put that that image on it it does the overlay so it looks like it's actually on the shirt like the whole thing and then you bulk generate you know we'll say 10 different variations so it's basically a mockup generator that is a part of that as well and I I think that that this is again another million dollar a year company if not10 million dollar a year just based on the market size and how much sales how much is happening in this space so can't believe you just gave that one for free dude I this is all these things I wish I had time to build right like I sit here and I just like when I can't sleep and I'm in pure insomnia this is the things I think about I was just thinking about the the Epic gardening and like what I would do this is what I was thinking about this morning when I was like laying in bed it's like oh like I was him this is how I would do this and it was like it' just be a programmatic SEO play and then I you know naturally that's what I spent portion of this morning looking at is like all the angles to basically go and build out just like a massive website to increase their volume real quick on that real quick on that so he's a he's a big YouTuber I think he might has must have a million subscribers at this point and I believe he is name Kevin I think it's Kevin right Kevin yeah yeah Kevin I think he started selling seeds different you know right so rare seeds yeah what would you do you know T you know what's your advice to Kevin the only reason I say this is because someone else might be like oh I'll I'll go and do that yeah so I would look at like seeds there's thousands of them right which means there's millions of keyword variations for all those different seeds so what's great when you have a e-commerce website that has a ton of SKS that you're selling you can basically mix and match like all of the different uh products that you're selling this is how marketplaces actually work right like if you look at an Etsy or Amazon they have millions of landing pages that are dynamically created based off of the keywords that they're seeing people search for within the platform that they're ranking for on Google Etc so with AI now you can basically do this and you can build out these massive sites when you're just a small like company right this is actually a business that my co-founder and I Max were thinking about building at one point we ended up going with swell and that's like you know what we're shipping on currently but there's this opportunity to basically approach Shopify stores that have massive amounts of listings and you're like yo like you've got 10,000 SKS uh we're going to programmatically dynamically spin up a million different landing pages I'm going to go and I'm going to do autoindexing using Google's indexing API for every key that you have you can do 200 uh calls a day you can have 20 different uh accounts or 20 different projects on a Google Cloud account so uh right there that's what that's 4,000 submissions a day that you can do to ask for crawl budget and this can all be done I mean we built this whole thing out and we got somebody to pay us like three grand to do this and then again we just ended up going in a different direction just because we saw more Market poll but with all that said the the the angle here is you basically take the same product but you can mix them up in all these different ways and build all these landing pages and a lot of the times what ends up happening is it's the same products it's the same bestselling products for XYZ seeds right um we'll say like daffodils or whatever there's you know Carnation any any of these different variations but there's all of these longtail keywords that are being searched for that and if you build landing pages for this like I've seen this on websites that I've worked on where it's like we ship 10,000 landing pages and you know 14 days after publishing these like just publishing them like not even doing any indexing we were accounting for almost 30% % of the organic traffic that was happening on the site on a daily basis right so increased it by 30% in 14 days and also increased the uh organic click volume by about 10% in 30 or in 14 days and so that's you know his company great example of this and you basically just build out this like massive site and you turn it into a Marketplace and honestly what I would probably then do soon as you have all that search volume you have all that domain trust Etc then you open it up as a Marketplace a gardening marketplace where vendors can come on and you B basically like charge a listing fee it's just a classic Marketplace play and you take a percentage of whatever the sales are that they're doing but I think that's that's the you know if I was in his shoes like that is what I would do and that's the path I would follow and again this is Peak manic insomnia so how I like you this is exactly how I love you but anyway hell yeah illiterate and manic as hell you know it man that's the only way I know how to live just gas down I have two modes it's either it's either I'm like laying flat and not doing anything or I'm going as fast as I can and that's that's how I like cities that's how I like my life it's like either the biggest city you've ever been in or like in the middle of the woods like you know it's it's it's just both sides of the the the Spectrum it's the only place I know how to live so cool all right um next one Ai and grants again one of these is stumbled ACR upon just looking at uh uh data and so grants the industry uh Grant management software the market size is 2.5 billion insane had no idea this is just like writing grants and submitting them and seeing if you got the money back right um so I looked at the search volume in relationship so AI Grant finder search volume for it AI grant writer search volume for it's not a ton but it's like growing quickly and I think people are just realizing this is possible so I think there's a market to punch in through here so what this looks like this is totally a software play an anow software play I'm imagining what it ends up being is like it's an all-in-one solution where it's like you put in the type of your you know information about your company and then access to all of the grant you know basically aggregation websites and then what the AI does is it goes and it rank Stacks the grant opportunities against each other based off of your information it finds the ones that are most likely for you to get money off of and you can like Factor okay what's the size Etc and then you basically build a writer then in on top of that so it has your company's information and then it has what the grant is asking for you know whatever it is you need to provide to like from a proposal standpoint and the AI is bridging that Gap to create uh you know to basically get this money for you uh and I know this space is massive so this is how most uh most HUD housing is actually built so a builder will go and they'll basically write for grant money so they can get this building you know basically subsidized for free and and then 20 years after uh the building has existed they then own that outright right but the you know the government just built this thing that they're renting for is because they have to hit these um affordable housing uh uh like minimums for my understanding again this isn't where I spend a lot of time this isn't the space that I'm deeply in but I had a friend that worked at one of these companies she was just like this is all she did was like basically manage a team that wrote grants for this this Builder right so anyway yeah so this idea would actually rip it especially in in countries that are less like more socialist than the United States so% I did a quick uh perplexity search um I'm here in Canada for the summer and um like just for students the Canadian government gives $3.2 billion do a year uh for Grants and then you have film and art and you know what I'm talking about so it's just and no one not no one but most people don't want to actually go through the work in filling a grand so this idea makes makes a lot of sense to me totally and the distribution play here is just copy Jenny AI look at their playbook and basically that's the distribution mechanism it's the same thing right do influencer type stuff uh that levels up into SEO uh and I mean I've seeing this more and more and I'm curious your thoughts on this where I'm seeing software companies more and more basically do Partnerships with the largest influencers in a space that are currently uh basically shilling some type of software that's in their category and then they're like yo we're going to give you an equity share whatever five 5% or something and uh you're you have to you know you're going to do x amount of posts or whatever just of course they'll promote this thing like right at this moment right they're only getting whatever that percentage fee is from uh whatever the affiliate commission and they're like oh if I can own this company it's a way more valuable asset right I'm already promoting this other software that I'm an affiliate on how do I create this partnership with it but that's an idea in itself by way you just you look at what creators and celebrities are are Shilling naturally Y and you can start with software and then you just approach them and be like hey I see your chilling cap cut um I'm gonna go create a cap cut competitor for you exactly exactly 100% I think it's that's the new future is I think what's going to happen and I think it's changing what the [ __ ] like where is Venture going to fit into that like you're telling me that like I'm going to write you a check and then you're going to give 5% of this company away to this influencer like I think that traditional VC is going to look at that and be like what do you mean that's what we're doing like absolutely not but what that does I think the leverage has changed within all of this right like now if you want to be an excellent VC like you have to have distribution like it's more important than ever I'm working with this uh VC company or this this firm uh right now we're growing their podcast email news letter right because they're like yo we're realizing like this is how you want to be competitive like we have to have distribution like we have to create inbound of the best Founders in the world right and it's to your I think you said this on a a different show that we were that we we recorded but like people think a16z is a venture company it's like no they're a media company that does venture right it's the opposite it's the way other way around and I I challenge every person that's listening to this to think about this now you're no longer a company that makes media you're a media company that makes product right you're no longer a product company that makes media you're a media company that makes product and I think that that is the thing that's happening and as soon as people realize that and adopt this that's how they're creating a Competitive Edge for themselves when whatever and this works most effectively in industries that are not software that are you know the the grimy like old school dirt under the fingernails types of businesses why do you think Paul Graham built Hacker News 100% because he wanted every person that would be his inbound Target right and he and they curated it in the beginning from my understanding like the things that would go to page like you know top position it was only the stuff that they found interesting which naturally over time attracts the people that they want to basically write checks to right we have time for one last idea cool all right this one is a huge one um and I don't really know I again stumbled on this data and I just find it interesting so it's a larger Trend that's happening but so nobody a lot of people don't know this but I I studed economics in college this is actually what I'm really interested in is like big data Trend analysis I always joke like I'm a practicing econ IST which is they don't exist that's called being you know an entrepreneur doing business um which again they don't exist uh so what's happening right now is that basically all of the states are having to write these documents for solar uh wind farms like which geographies in in the states are the best places to basically put wind and and like to do renewable energy in that in that geography States so if you go and you search you know Washington best place for solar wind farm Washington or best place for solar wind farm Oregon all of these public documents exist documenting okay here's the here's the places where the wind's consistent here's the uh energy that can produce per acre of land that exists there Etc so I think there's this opportunity I saw this and immediately I'm just like okay Gold Mine this is basically signaling where everybody's going to build these things and I'm still working out the numbers I'll probably actually publish you know all everything that we're we're because again this is I find this interesting this is what I do in free time with all the free time I have um but the I think the angle here there's a couple different angles is basically like some of these areas like you can get an acre of land like I we just found one where it was like $140 right for an acre of land and that acre of land when you put wind on it it's in one of these geographies that they're saying it's like a high uh a high it's like an energy dense area for wind and that acre of land can produce like 1,400 a year when you rent out the space when you put one of these turbines on it you can I the the payback on this [ __ ] is insane Greg okay so an acre of land again imagine it cost you we'll say $1,000 right you can get these turbines uh for uh for every uh and I'm probably G to mess up this information so people correct us but it's going to be close but um for every megawatt of energy like turbine that you produce you can get them for about a million three so you're into this thing for 1.4 right and you need about an acre to an acre and a half per megawatt for my understanding what that turns into is that uh when you sell the energy that that turbine can produce again this is just based off of like quick Google search stuff we're going to do like a probably a deeper document on this whole thing but when you look at the energy that that can produce it's in the range of $600,000 per year when you're selling it on the open market I don't know what the margins are on any of this but that's like the amount of energy that a single turbine can produce is that number so that means that's true right that your payback period on this investment is 2.4 years right I'm over here and I'm looking at this and I'm thinking holy [ __ ] [ __ ] like this is going to be an absolute Gold Rush right like we think about what happened in you know Wildcat oil days like it's the same thing they're defining these areas that are going to be high value and like this was happening during that same period where you had basically geologists were going and looking at these areas and saying hey this area is like strong likelihood oil right like how did Getty you know make all of his money he used the data that the geologists were using and that's like the angle that and so I think there's a bunch of different plays here I think there's like an angle where it's like you build a website that's aggregating all of these areas they're like it's specific zip codes a lot of the times so anytime land like grow you know just land like raw land comes up in those areas um it comes up on that site you're basically SC in all of that you're aggregating it and you have some type of email notification I think that's the software play that's probably in here I think the other play is you go and you you know you build basically a fund go and you buy up these locations and I mean right now the government's subsidizing these commercial you know Pro uh projects like it's like 30% basically tax credits that you get back on this [ __ ] so you're telling me I can you can buy a turbine for it's one you know whatever 1.3 but you're getting it for 800k I mean [ __ ] that's a [ __ ] that's a that's a residential home right now like that's insane and so the crazy part about this too is like again if that payback period is right and please somebody that knows way more about this like send me the send us the information and the data because like I'm you know obsessed with this right now and I want to know and again we're going to do all this research but this is this is like just the last week of stuff that I've collected so that payback period is 2.4 years the average lifespan of one of these turbines is 30 years right so that means that 20 whatever 27 out of the 30 years that this thing is is exists it's making you money basically it's printing 600k a year again just using what the market uh is is paying for that again there's a margin in there somewhere I'm just using that that we'll talk to say that's topl line revenue so if you have a you have a hundred of these things right that are running on a on a wind farm like that I mean you just do the math right like that's 60 million sorry yeah that's 60 million yeah like scale it up to a thousand that's 600 million scale that up to 10,000 like gets insane very quickly right and we're not talking about like massive things and the government is investing in this there's Tailwinds behind it the data is public I think this is like this is a massive thing that's way above my pay scale but something that's very interesting that I'm looking at like you know that's a 40-year Time Horizon type of deal yeah I I like it the not enough people are talking about the tax benefits from it uh there's uh there's a guy by by the name of aner nagpal he started carry.com he didn't talk specifically about when um but he did talk about solar and I didn't know if like I don't know if you know this but there's like crazy tax benefits if you invest in a commercial solar project I had no idea yeah upfront federal tax credit there's depreciation that offsets federal and state and you get the income stream from the project so for example he tweeted this he was like if you invest a million dollars in a solo project you get 40% tax credit up up front so it's l literally $400,000 against your tax bill that's number one then you get to depreciate the asset with time God so that's a essentially a he calls it a phantom loss that you deduct against your taxes so these projects can be fully depreciated minus half the tax credit over five years uh and then you get the income stream so you know he he he says you know if you get 5% for 20 years that's 50k a year so he says let's put it all together for a million doll investment you get $400,000 tax credit upfront $800,000 in federal depreciation $800,000 in state depreciation and then 50,000 a year for 20 years and then I almost did so I didn't believe it honestly so I texted like one of the an entrepreneur who Who develops tons of these projects he's he's in the space yeah he's in the space so I was like there's I just said I just texted I sent him the link to that do send a bag I was like cuz I was I was Su I was sus you know so I was like what have I been doing not investing in solar my whole life and then he said lots of challenges making for work for W2 employees but if you're not it's amazing for business owners and high net worth folks god um lots of brain damage learning the tax code and finding dilc in deals but yes it's great and a great invest investment I mean that's probably a company they spin out though right it's like you spin out this investment arm and also the tax code arm that's service clients that are investing in this and they're paying you a percentage and you have some you know whatever some type of fee that's built I so something I found fascinating is that last year in 2023 there was 10x the amount of investment in Wind than there was in solar interesting even though solar is cheaper why is that per no idea but this is just what's happening I think it's like I so my uh my girlfriend's from the semiconduction spase and she's Material Science engineer she did a bunch of [ __ ] neuromorphic stuff basically way smarter than me right she can read and so the what she said is that the upkeep on these solar panels is the challenge because there's breakage that occurs naturally right it's like a [ __ ] piece of glass so like hail happens or you got to clean them off and those types of things just like a lot of moving parts that are existing within a single unit and so when you scale that up it gets you know you have a lot of nodes that can go wrong basically now in contrast when you look like a turbine it's like yo it's just a spinning big spinning thing right the challenge is the manufacturing of them and the transport like that's the issue I mean I don't know if you've ever been on a remote Highway and you know whole section is cut off because one of the wind blades is taking up both lanes and you know like that that's something that is happening right and so I think that they're figuring this out and the costs are coming down with this but it's already cheaper than natural gas and natural gas it looks like can't go cheaper so what's going to naturally happen in the market and solar's still getting cheaper that's the crazier part with this like it looks like wind is kind of that its like you know threshold of of of decreasing costs but solar looks like it's can go like further down um so this transition is going to happen right like the market is already solving for that like it's going to be cheaper than ever before to produce energy through these materials uh or sorry through these these uh through wind and solar now it's just a matter of time it's just like how can you basically ride this larger wave that's happening and again to to your point I don't I don't even think you have to build these things just writing checks into this right like you go and you build these other businesses and but I mean it's no brainer right totally the what you just laid out it's like of course I'm going like it's going to win we all know business right like the thing that we're using currently and there's something that's cheaper okay yes right also the thing that I found super interesting is like a lot of the states that you wouldn't think that would be investing in these Renewables actually are Texas is the leader right now they're producing the most renewable energy in the US and like historically I mean that is where Oil comes from right like the oil like you all of the old families there are all oil families right but they're investing in this and they're just looking at I mean it's just it it just comes down to Dollars and cents right this is cheaper to do this than it was also these I think it's very interesting when you now start to think about this as the a resource a natural resource that this uh like traditionally natural resources when you look at them it's like you know does it have Timber does it have mining does it have these these you know does have water rights Etc uh and this is now an added natural resource suddenly these states are becoming more valuable like they're natural resources that they have like you just invented two new categories like do you get a lot of sun oh do you have a lot of land cool like you just solar form right like so when you look at like Northern Nevada as an example like that's an asset that now suddenly exists right and again you have an area where it's like constant wind that's humming right and access to a grid okay that's a solar farm and so you have this natural resource that now has come into an existence and so I think what enry whenever this happens or has happened historically like you see generational wealth come into existence so yeah that's that's that's my uh that's my that's my Spiel the monologue is done it's beautiful you that the whole thing was you know I have a tear coming slowly down my face you're you're an angel you're the violin somewhere back exactly somewhere back there if you've if you've made it this far in the episode the only the only way we know to create more episodes is if you subscribe on YouTube like on YouTube comment on YouTube we read the comments and uh you know go check Cody out he's uh a phenomenal Twitter account Google him the you stuff will come it should and on YouTube not if I don't come up I'm doing it wrong I'm doing my job wrong and I'm very bad at that's true but we'll include some links uh in in the YouTube description anyways thanks again Cody you're a g love G thanks for hosting man I always always enjoy it you always make me think about it in a different way it's like so valuable to me so my pleasure I'll see you

what is the thing that you find the most difficult and painful about entrepreneurship the most painful part about being an entrepreneur to me is the uncertainty period Anything could happen you know if you're building a SAS startup for example you wake up every day and you check product hunt and you're like I hope that you know if you're competing against figma figma didn't launch something to compete directly against you there's like 800 lb gorillas literally everywhere uh could squash you in in a moment and I just think that the uncertainty and the slot machine nature of being an entrepreneur it is tough it is it is really tough you have to be at peace with it if you're not able to be at peace with the uncertainty then you'll never survive as an [Music] entrepreneur J cream is back hello what's up dude I'm sipping here I'm sipping over here sipping time baby I'm sipping some B I don't know if it's pronounced b b it means mouth in French it means mouth oh no I'm sipping on some mouth yeah wouldn't be the first time hey how are you doing man I'm good I'm uh at the cabin in the woods on the Lake Canada very nice feeling good just had a Nitro cold brew oh [ __ ] which uh which makes you feel real good there's about 350 milligrams of caffeine in it so that's an average cup of coffee I think has 80 oh that sounds dangerous yeah so I'm ready to talk about whatever it is you want to talk about because I'm in The Matrix okay uh all right so before the before you hit record I asked you if it was going to be okay to bring this topic to you and you just pressed record so you don't know what it is yet so it's how the podcast works I like it um I've been pushing so I've been running my company for 14 years coming up in September uh AJ and smart and there's been many and and basically the topic I want to talk about is kind of like burnout and keeping going as a self-employed kind of solopreneur entrepreneur like I guess my first question is do you ever feel just like [ __ ] like I I just have so much going on there's just too much I just want to get rid of it all and go sell it and live in a cabinet in the woods in Canada so I guess my first question before I even ask any other questions because I want to learn some [ __ ] from you here is do you get to those phases where you're just done with it all I don't like I don't yeah I don't I don't let it get to that point you know if I'm if I'm ever if I'm ever feeling like I'm overwhelmed and too much stuff is going on I just I just take a step back like instead of you know here's one thing I'll say I actually work every day like s days a week I'm working some amount of time and I know that's not what you're supposed to do but I do it because especially in the mornings for me I notice that like I'm really like I get like one hour of work is like in the morning is like eight hours in the afternoon at night for me so if I notice that I'm like getting close to being burnt out like maybe instead of working two hours every day uh or on a weekend type thing I'll just you know I'll go to 30 minutes so I'll just or or or I'll go to zero you know um so I I'm very conscious of about the burnout and I just don't get too close to the Sun so talk to me about this you do you work every day by the way which I think is who gives a [ __ ] like there's no rules about when you can work and when you can't work and I think it's ridiculous that yeah everyone's trying to jam everything into the Monday to Friday uh and actually that could be causing a lot of burnout because you're jamming it all in there then you're like now is my time where I take take my break and now I'm back so you said you work best in the morning so the reason you work every day is just so you can work every morning instead of having to work full days just Monday to Friday like how much do you tend to like what's your workday look like well I work every day because I don't look at it like on a week to week basis I'm like okay I've got like some stuff to do this year and some goals I want to hit this year and I and I want to hit them and so my aage average day is like I wake up I I wake up pretty early and I have three things I need to do every single day and if I do those three things by 2 pm I'm out but if it takes me longer you know I I don't stop until I finish those three things every day how do you figure out what those three things are are you doing any sort of like I don't know task making exercises or prioritization things or is it just like you wake up and you're like here's the fires or here's the interesting things to do or well what does it look like I think people who over optimize on like this whole productivity system stuff like take it too far you inherently you inherently know that there's like two or three things that you need to do just do the thing and and also can we be honest it's not like we're toiling away mining you know doing mining you know going down in a m shaft we're literally pressing buttons on the internet that's like our work you know absolutely and it's so fun it is so fun I think so I'll tell you where my struggle comes from so I agree it's fun um I also don't have productivity systems and honestly most of the people I know who have like really detailed product productivity systems are generally entrepreneurs they pretend they are going to be entrepreneurs but all they do is just make like systems but they don't make any money at all um actually know someone who is H I don't want to yeah it could be it could be too close let's say I know a person called Kevin just because I have this book here right uh who obsesses about systems and reading all the books and reading all the entrepreneurship stuff and collect all these systems and literally has never made $ one do as an entrepreneur mainly Works in corporates but talks about being an entrepreneur all the time and so I would generally agree with you productivity stuff is just like not for real business people here's the nonstem system I'll give it you the non-system hit me Greg eisenberg's non-system system is this wake up relatively early what's early for you whatever no for for who you know for some people that might be 8:30 for some people that might be 4:30 so whatever it is for you break up relatively early take out a piece of paper or an iOS note and pick three things that you need to do do the three things and don't get burned out don't fly too Coast to the sun you know like that's that's what it is that's that's all it is quick ad break let me tell you about a business I invested in it's called boring marketing.com so a few years ago I met this group of people that were some of the best SEO experts in the world they were behind getting some of the biggest companies found on Google and the secret sauce is they've got a set of technology and AI that could help you outrank your competition so for my own businesses I wanted that I didn't want to have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I didn't want to depend on ads to drive customers to my businesses I wanted to rank high in Google that's why I like SEO and that's why I use boring marketing.com and that's why I invested in it they're so confident in their approach that they offer a 30-day Sprint with 100% money back guarantee who does that nowadays so check it out highly recommend boring marketing.com okay let me ask for some context here feel free to cut any of this out I will not cutting any of this out but I'm gonna ask questions as if I'm as if you might cut stuff out but great I'm just gonna ask freely okay yes um many times when I'm talking to entrepreneurs who are very relaxed um and I'm confused about why they're so relaxed h i find out that they're already ludicrously rich so I'll give you an example I know an entrepreneur who talks a lot about you know not pushing too hard and and like it's all easy and it's all fine and I found out that he got like an a$8 million kind of inheritance uh a very long time ago and then I was like of course I wouldn't be [ __ ] burnt out if I had1 million in my bank account so my question is were you always this CH well first of all do you have like crazy inheritance and you just don't give a [ __ ] about money and it's all good 100% of the money I have and the wealth I made has been self-made from inheritance from inheritance 100% of the money I've made has been from inheritance and uh and winning the lottery you know yes yes yes no I think uh this system is a system I developed when I was 18 or 19 okay so when I had nothing when I had no companies when you know when I was just getting started this is what I developed so so it's not like now that you know I quote unquote made it or or have a little bit of money it's it's like yeah I'm way more chill it's like no no I it's I've always this is how I've always been you seem very very chill but you also seem to get a lot done um and so I'm like you can't wrap your your brain around it honestly I I yeah it's It's tricky because I'll tell you for me one of the things that gets me or or the times where I'm the least chill is usually when a part of the business is not working necessarily or very well and I can tell that it needs like an overhaul in order to start working well again um for example like last year the consulting or like the corporate Consulting and corporate training side of the business just needed a massive overhaul and I could tell like basically stagnating Revenue stagnating profits actually the profits were starting to slowly go down and I could just see [ __ ] like in a few months time this is going to be hitting the break even point and then we're going to start losing cash flow and I see a project of that size and sometimes I'm just like I'm just not in the mood to do that right now like I'm not in the mood to take it on and this could be related to the way I have not necessarily hired and staffed up in the way maybe you have like uh too at LCA who seems to just be able to take things and run with them but Laura and I at AJ and smart uh definitely have this feeling that if if we if something starts to stagnate it's not possible to fix it without me personally jumping in or Laura personally jumping in do you still get dragged into things like that or are you just totally are you out of this sort of Revenue cash flow day-to-day stuff I drag myself into it I don't that you know we have a bunch of companies under lay checkout and a lot of you know it a lot of the times some of them are struggling more than others and but a lot of the people running it don't want to bring me in because that's like you know an area of Last Resort and they want to fix the problem themselves and and that's that's amazing right yeah but I don't want to make it seem like I'm so chill that I'm just like all right yeah good luck all these companies I like I'm I'm not I'm I I I really care about these businesses seeing full potential so like I I'm I'm in the slack I'm looking at things I'm asking questions but you can do those things and not work 20 hours a day sure and actually just to be clear and I know this is becoming a therapy session for me thanks Greg um I don't work an abnormal amount of hours it's more like the the amount of hours I do and sometimes it is three or four hours they uh they can be quite consequential for the business like they can be the ones that make the decision that makes us uh the money for the next six months um and so and then and obviously I have experimented with stepping out and and being out of the business for quite some time uh and then like more stagnation sort of kicks in so I guess at least today I feel like I'm still very much need did and that I guess that stress of knowing that if I just take my eye off the ball something can fall apart any person running Su successful business will now say well your business is not robust enough you're right uh and that's what I'm trying to figure out but yeah like that's the stuff that kind of stresses me out doesn't mess with my sleep it isn't all the time um but it does there are like sometimes weeks where I'm like oh man now I want to sell the compy like whenever I'm annoyed with AJ and smart I'm like [ __ ] this I'm just taking the money out and I'm done you know that that that comes to my mind yeah I mean of course it comes to your mind but I think people are gonna I think people are going to listen to this and are going to be like sh this is champagne problems Jonathan obviously we're we're running a this is a um entrepreneur podcast like it's it's a we're not trying to help people figure out how to do important life although we're yeah we're talking about [ __ ] anyone saying they're champagne problems they're coming to this podcast to listen to two relatively successful entrepreneurs talk about stuff [ __ ] you [ __ ] all you guys I'm just I just think that someone's listening to this and being like burnout you know like I'm just trying to get Financial Freedom right now I want to like retie my parents I want to do all these things I need to BU you know buy a house have you seen the have you seen the price of coffee lately you know someone okay that's your audience okay let me ask you let me change the topic uh maybe wait I thought all all your audience were millionaire uh entrepreneur no maybe maybe I mean to put a bow on this topic I think that realistically you can get a lot done in eight hours a day just figure out yeah what what are the most productive hours and and slap Do Not Disturb mode and have a cold you know a Nitro cold nro cold brew and uh see you in outer space do you use Zin do you use nicotine pouches I'm not I'm not a I'm not a Zin not a Zin boy no oh man yeah I also I mean I only realize now that Zin is these pouches that they also sell in Sweden so like uh easy access but I heard they can be quite add Ive yeah yeah I think uh I think that that's what they say nicotine is uh what is it it's like more addictive than heroin or something like that oh my God okay yeah I'm I'm I'm stay I'm gonna just continue drinking mouth yeah until until further notice okay wait I just want to make sure I got so I so you basically just don't ever get to the point where you feel overwhelmed or stressed you don't go too close to the that's right great dude and I mean of of course I get stressed like okay business revenue is down 30% month over month we lost our biggest client I don't know that you know our technology is built on this API and they just shut it off that's stressful but being stressed isn't going to help the problem you know what helps the problem is figuring out what is your most productive you know time zone how do you get in the state to get most productive right and and then what are the things that you need to do to move the needle the quickest and go and do that and that's it and just do it every day yeah and I know that sounds like really simple but that's what it is everything else is noise and fluff and and and this is the system that worked for me the non all right dude yeah [ __ ] Superman over there so you so the unfortunate answer to this question is you are as chilled as you seem unfortunately do your would your employees say that you are a chilled person to work with I don't know I don't know CU I think when when they see me it's always in a moment of there's something wrong and me being like you know ask I'm also very direct so ah do people say that about like I know that people say about me that I'm very direct but also like I don't talk about the positive things I'm just talking about the ne I'm like a very much a firefighter um I jump in and I'm like this is broken this is broken this is broken we need to fix this this this this this let's do this this this this this goodbye um and that obviously rubs people the wrong way and I've heard obviously negative things coming out of that uh like no one no one who works with me would say oh Jonathan's so chilled it wouldn't be what they would uh talk about me publicly yeah I don't I don't think people say that inter I mean I don't know but I don't think internally people are like Greg is super chill because it's the same situation like when I when they see me I'm generally in with a fire a firefighter hat on yeah yeah all right dude all right and it's and it's like you it's like yeah like here's all here's here here are all my questions like let me collect all the data points once I have those data points then it's like okay based on this here's what we need to do that da da that da da da also why didn't we do these three things and and the reason why I I I say that is because I you know I don't want to be I don't want to dress up as a a sexy firefighter you know just topless but like not in shape I always said that for you because I know that you'd appreciate that I love it I love it and I don't want to do that because I sorry you know I want to spawn many firefighters within the organizations right so yeah um as a hold Co entrepreneur that's what you're trying to do you're trying to build the um you know the reflexes for the companies within themselves to come and come and be like whoa who you know Michelle is the firefighter because she sees something and she sees revenues down or she hears that you know Twitter's API you know is is being shut off or whatever it is okay okay well you can tell I came to this uh session today uh in a stressed mode and I just wanted you to say you get stressed too but [ __ ] you Greg yeah yeah I mean I do get stressed but but you never get to the point where you're like [ __ ] this thing [ __ ] LCA I'm selling it I'm done with all this I'm going to go live in a cab and then I'll get I'll think about what I want to do in about five years no I don't I I can honestly say that doesn't cross my mind I I get to that point multiple times per year not just with a like just it's part of the way my brain works sometimes I'm like ah but why that that business has generated like millions of dollars of profits for you why would you go and just decide hey it's no longer for me well first of all I'm very grateful for the revenue and profit it generates and I love the business and it is a big part of my life um it's just sort of part of how my brain works I would say like sometimes I just hit a wall and get sick of something and I just want to move on to something new and interesting uh I generally hold myself back from doing that and like stay on the Core Business uh and and the problem is sometimes it's also worked out really well like I remember a couple of years ago like seven or eight years ago I was so sick of just Focus or relying on client work to make money and you maybe know the cash flow kind of variation when you're just doing client uh Consulting work and we started the education business with in-person training then online training and that complete like that moved our run like burn rate from like three months to like 15 months to 18 months and I was like holy [ __ ] just being super annoyed at something sometimes generates interesting things um yeah I mean what I often say is I'm not the right person to be the CEO because I'm the the I am the person when I get annoyed with something even if it's making money I'm like I don't want to do this anymore I don't want us to do this anymore and why don't you just hire a CEO um Laura and I have talked about this and multiple times and I think yeah one part about it is I is the idea of looking for someone sounds annoying um and I and I've heard that process is very difficult and and like often doesn't work out um the other part is like maybe I'm just not ready to let it go just yet um the other part is I did bring in a CEO for the Consulting business and [ __ ] [ __ ] hit the fan majorly so I did let that one happen although it did work well for two years like brought in a CEO kept the numbers stable it didn't really grow and then it was like um yeah it's but well that's a bad answer because it's a bad answer like okay the hiring okay I've hired a CEO before and it didn't really work out is like is like saying well it's a lazy answer you know I I didn't say I wasn't lazy I I had a broken heart before therefore I'm never going to date again basally that so that that's a that's a bad answer how do you think can you assess whether we should have a new CEO can we do an assessment you you own so many companies the assessment is yes this is the assessment if you if you if you are having racing thoughts from time to time that you want to sell the business and like it's only when I'm annoyed with it how many times per year do you think that thought hits you um four times maybe per year no Nob brainer there's this is if that thought is coming at least once per quarter then see you later Life's too short for it you'll hire someone who actually cares a lot about about it more now you have to be okay with the fact that CEO might be worse than you and it might not work out and it might take three CEOs for it to work out and that's just the nature of yeah I know and it's crazy and you know or you might get lucky um but I think that that's just the reality of of giving your baby to someone else I'm not against it I think you know we're we are doing sort of a big relaunch in September I I talked to you a little bit about it off the podcast and I think that's the point where I like I basically have the vision for the next 12 months which I'm very excited about and very happy about and very proud of um and I feel like once that's in place that's the next 10 years worth of stuff for the company to do and I think I'd prefer I prefer for in that decade to be more in the role of the person who's bringing product ideas and bringing the maybe be like being the the sounding board for someone else who's running it versus being the person running it and making the decisions yeah it's a it's a constant conversation dude this is I have no idea if any of this is interesting for your audience I'm just telling you I just answered your question sorry I mean you're like you're like the audience is here to learn how to start a business and we're like so when you're 15 years into it and it's already making millions here's the small problems that you're gonna you know I think uh if I were you I would also become a hold Co entrepreneur yeah I have to talk I don't even really know what that is like so I would basically have a holding company and then that would own AJ and smart and that would also own own other companies and I would be on like the board of these companies yeah exactly you know what you know what I don't like about that for me yeah I really do not I I really optimize for peace like I like peace and calm and quiet and not a lot of stuff going on I don't even like traveling because it like annoy it kind of breaks me out of my routine and I love my routine I had a holding company which I shut down in December and I was doing Investments and I was looking into this concept and I think the way my brain works that would feel a i I'd love to be I'd love to help other companies with their products and their strategy with no paperwork at all and like I heard Jason freed saying this recently if they make [ __ ] tons of money and they feel like reimbursing me for the for the work I did great but I I don't know if I actually want to have I don't know if I want to do the paperwork for the and I know I wouldn't personally be doing the paperwork I wasn't personally doing the paperwork for my holding company and my company it's just that world of adding what do you think a holding company is well my the holding company I had which I started it's just a vehicle for owning other things yeah but there's lots of legal and paperwork behind that it's a it's a whole other company I mean this is the same dude this is the same uh same thing as the CEO thing where it's like your heart your heart has been broken by paperwork in the past therefore you're like I hate it yeah I hate it no I hope some people in the comments understand me here but I feel so much better when I'm working on one thing like doing like it's I like Simplicity and peace and I would always choose that over complexity even if it means way more money yeah but why why don't you just abstract away the paperwork so for example I own a holding company a co-own a I'm a co-founder in a holding company lay checkout and there's deals that get signed all the time and paperwork but and Inked Up but I'm not involved in signing them I just trust other people to sign them and then I don't yeah yeah I don't sign every deal like like $450,000 deals will come in which I won't even see it's more that I feel like I'm going to come across like a complete idiot on this call because this is the truth the TR because my entrepreneur friends also think I'm stupid when it comes to this stuff it is there's more noise when I have holding company plus AJ and Smart Plus a few other things going on there's more text messages there's more emails there's more slacks and it doesn't matter how in like automated and incentivized everyone is someone will always come to me and say yeah you know I'd actually like to talk about my compensation for doing this thing in this company and I I simply don't enjoy the amount of new open threads it creates someone we know we know you and I know Sam somewhat Sam ovens he has a SIM similar brain in a way that he like hyper focuses on one thing and leaves infinite money on the table because of wanting to avoid complexity and so for me for me I view that as as more complex than I want to go to even though everyone tells me I'm stupid about it and I don't disagree with them so I agree it's stupid that I won't do the whole Co thing but it just makes me feel stressed it's the reason I also don't own a place I don't I I have a very simple easy setup life I think that you can still have an easy simple life if you just abstract away things and I think the what you need to do is is figure out how you can abstract away the things that you really don't like abstract away meaning giving it to other people correct dude it always comes back yeah it always comes back it like as in for me it it still like let's say um like there's always things that come back to the legal owner yes you know what I mean eventually yeah obviously but you know it doesn't it it doesn't have to happen like very frequently you know it happens per quarter yeah exactly I am literally talking about that level but it's like all right you're I don't know again what you want to put on the podcast I have a kid in the picture that makes everything 10 times louder and 10 times more complicated and she's not in the kindergarten and now there's an outbreak of a vomiting bug and now I have this thing over here and I have this thing over here it's it makes me feel stressed and and like loud even when one thing per extra thing per quarter comes in whereas when I'm just running one business it's still lot of stuff but dude you know what I think I need to talk to you about this CU maybe you're right maybe I'm just doing way too many things that are completely unnecessary but I have these phases where I like step out of everything and then I'm like all right I'm free and then I get bored and then I'm like I'm going to go in and then I'm like I'm overwhelmed and finding this Middle Ground between bored and overwhelmed I find very tricky you need to do and people listening should do this too is like just an audit a straight up audit of all the things you do is it necessary is it unnecessary what can you abstract away what can you not abstract away and then what's your goal what what is the goal you want to you know come to and and and I think that's that's it that's that's like that's going to help you like that's the framework that's the non-framework framework um so you have some serious thinking you got to do Jonathan do you have a financial goal like big p so that's the I think that's one of the issues I have is that I don't know what I'm actually working toward like I don't have like oh this would be the number I would love to have or this is the thing I'm trying to do like with AJ and smart I'm like 10 million Revenue but it's like a random thing I pull out of my head it's not a do you have for yourself personally do you have like a financial goal on a yearly basis or like when you want to retire like when do you want to have be financially free something like that am I coming across as like really neurotic and weird on this episode just the way I wanted this couldn't have gone better so I have a financial rate of return that I want to hit in my portfolio which includes liquid and non liquid and I have goals for each of my individual businesses um which um you know some are financial and some are not but they're all kind of made up goals it's just pretty arbitrary but it's just you need you know what is what isn't measured what is it what's the expression what isn't measured doesn't get managed something like that something like that that's the that's the basic measure something that's a basic idea that's the basic idea I mean if you don't basically if you don't you don't if you don't measure are you gonna say the same thing again uh if you don't measure you don't manage uh we did this uh a few times ago in the Pod St into the river the river's moving exactly so I'm not good at sayings I'm not good at sayings but I am good at balance you still go for the sayings yeah I still go for it that's the type of guy I am I appreciate that you do actually put out the podcast unedited like this yes I mean in a way it can be painful to watch because there are any awkward silences between you and I are actually just still in there I'd appreciate if your editors would remove some of that uh but I I think it's cool that you're willing to just put it out there and including the fact that you say these saying and then forget them and just doesn't matter I mean I think it's great just this is like the real the real life of of entrepreneurs right this is this is it this conversation you know everything we're saying is real and and and and that's what I want to put out there so what is I think this could be the title uh and this could be the clip here coming up because I feel like what is the thing that you find the most difficult and painful about entrepreneurship um so I my answer to that question is that I do do have the feeling that there's a lot of weight on my shoulders to make the decisions that move us forward and the financial wellbeing of the people who are employed by me and and like the the direction and all of that and then sometimes I'm like man I wonder could I just make the same amount of money not doing all of that and not having all of this responsibility so for me definitely there's this feeling of wouldn't it be great if someone else would just tell me what to do sometimes um and instead of having to be basically creative all the time uh what do you find painful or negative or what like what sometimes really gets you about being an entrepreneur I'm trying to get [ __ ] anything out of you man the most painful part about being an entrepreneur to me is the uncertainty period so anything could happen you know you wake up you know if you're building a SAS startup for example you wake up every day and you check product hunt and you're like I hope that uh you know if you're competing against figma figma didn't launch something to compete directly against you there's like 800 pound gorillas literally everywhere that uh could squash you in in a moment and I just think that the uncertainty and the slot machine nature of being an entrepreneur just it is tough it is it is really tough and you have to be at peace with it if you're not able to be at peace with the uncertainty then you'll never survive as an entrepreneur at all at all so uh that's another reason I like being a holdco entrepreneur or multipreneur as I call it because you know if you have a bunch of Revenue lines and product lines even if one of them suffers from one of these 800 PB gorillas or or an upstart or a BL Swan event like co uh it's okay and because you have other Revenue lines that are doing well and then I would say because I guess we're just different types of entrepreneurs I would say that it would be difficult for me to go all in on one of them and really like I don't know I feel like right now with AJ and smart we've the last couple years we've been sort of like are we a training company or are we a consulting company and I I think actually we're about to go in a direction that will be more akin to the way you're doing it today um where we have a bit more separation between between the brands and actually maybe maybe all of this bullshitting I've been talking about in this episode is going to be all undone when people see the the relaunch because it's a bit more hold Coy um but I yeah I think for me I struggle first of all uncertainty absolutely I think if you inherently are struggle with uncertainty I don't think you'll even go into entrepreneurship like you have people I feel like might you might because like there's a lot of people listening to podcasts like this and just seeing entrepreneurs out there and they're like I want that and then once they take the plunge and their heartbeat goes from 120 to you know their resting heartbeat goes from 120 to 180 overnight then and uh they're like what did I just sign up for what have I done what have I done like you know this your podcast talks a lot about ideas and I think ideas are great and all but you can't no but you can't come on the startup ideas podcast dude not love theast one startup idea by the way I'm gonna give a startup idea at the end of this podcast okay okay okay and then talk smack about startup ideas yeah no no no no no no no listen I think you'll agree with the next thing I'm going to say ideas are really important but the person who's actually executing the ideas and their mindset and their abilities is just as important if not more like if you took any of Cody Schneider's ideas his second name is Schneider right yes okay if you took any of Cody's ideas but you were really worried about uncertainty all the time and you were still like I don't know you just had this and you also got uh overwhelmed very easily and you had a lot of fear you'd have a harder time than someone who is more entrepreneurially inclined you you'd struggle with it more and so I think ideas are execution is just extremely important you came on the podcast to say execution is everything execution ideas podcast oh no startup execution podcast I mean obviously execution is important right you can't just come up with ideas but like when I say yeah debate me yeah I'll debate you I'll debate you actually yeah then let me put my statement more clear I do actually think execution is more important than the ideas themselves and I've seen people try to execute the same ideas as I do but they give up much quicker than me and so therefore it's as if it didn't matter in the first place ideas and execution are really important you can't do that one that's debate if we because I'm going to agree with that I'm going to agree with that the reality is this if you have really good ideas on a product a niche how to grow it and then who to hire to execute on it then you're Gucci oh yeah yeah you're right yeah you are right on that one I I guess when I say execution I mean the actual ability to follow through and even hire that person yeah yeah I mean tomato tomato you know what I'm saying tomato Tomo all right what's your [ __ ] startup idea all right here's just so you can say this is the name of the podcast so yeah I told you the topic wasn't necessarily related uh I'm here in Canada in in in the small town and uh every Saturday there's this farmers market and I've noticed that this farmers market over the years has gotten busier and busier and people are getting just cultish over it and I've noticed this in in when I'm in Miami the farmers markets and other places there's farmer markets and it's just this whole like shop local shop organic vibe that I think uh and I don't know how it is in Europe similar similar yeah similar like really cult they become super overcrowded everyone loves them I also love them um yeah I don't know what you're going to say next but that part is similar what I'm going to say next is that I think that so this town that has the farmers market is a really small town but there's so many people that come during on Saturdays that it's like really good for the town they find out about the town they're coming from all over uh there's then the you know restaurants are popping up and and all these sorts of things and I think that there's an opportunity to basically be the person that manages organizes farmers markets and then goes to you know you can go to cities and be or or towns and and Villages and be like hey like we want to set up this farmers market give us some space you you you curate the merchants the business model could be you take you either charge like essentially for the merchants or you just take like a percentage of Revenue and you're making the world a better place cuz you know shop local shop organic all these things so I just think that there's an opportunity this is a non-digital idea but I just think that there's like a pretty simple idea where if you if you care about shop local you can probably convince a lot of these entrepreneurs to set up shop you don't need that many of them maybe like six or 10 to start and definitely make and I think you can make a few thousand do a week just get going and then the last thing I'll say is you can what I like about this idea is you know if it works in this small town you can bring it to other small towns and uh replicate the model so I actually think that this is like a several million dollar year idea I love it and you could even like okay so the idea would be you're you're running is it like a two-sided Marketplace as well where you're also essentially bringing the customers by being also the advertiser for the event yes okay so that's really cool because what you could also do and you know if you want to get funding you have to say the word AI so you have to use AI to find the perfect towns where you can set this up where you can say find me we used this amazing AI to find the towns which do not yet have farmers markets but have all of the supply and are surrounded by a lot of demand and so we find these Center points and we turn them into these third spaces where people from different towns can come together and and you could also then expand it to I don't know if you guys like flea markets in Berlin are also super popular yeah and they like combine flea markets with farmers markets and it's like a whole thing you could just expand out to anything where this concept of local also like local art local Pottery local furniture making uh I love the idea I think it's great yeah yeah that's the idea and that's and you're giving it away because you know no one can execute it I'm giving it away because I would like to see a lot of nitro coffee for that one that's true I I do I do I would like to see more of these pop up and I just think think that it's one of those like really validated ideas the hard part about the idea is just getting these entrepreneurs to agree to show up on a Saturday morning or whatever because they have to staff it it's like a big logistical thing as well because uh well that also gives it sort of like a moat because if you can get this working it's really hard to compete with there's there's a I'm not going to reveal where I live but there is a market near to where I live and the company obviously who runs the market you know they set up the tables they set everything up so that the different companies can just come like uh there's a place here if you Google it called Mar tala noin and you rent the space they create they have the space they've now expanded it out onto the streets it's unbelievably popular and it's gone from being a farmers's market to now there being events on like Thursday nights and sat like Saturday there's like this cheese event and then there's a chocolate focused event that [ __ ] is like expanding like crazy and I never thought about it being an actual I never thought about the idea that you could be the middleman in between all of these places even then finding the location even like renovating the place being the person who brings all the tables you could really like Corner that market in your area are you going to do it probably not you got enough but you got your whole Co you can just like you abstract it out abstract it out I'm I'm I'm really into digital ideas right now okay yeah and but I think someone should do it how would you start something like that would you start by going to the suppliers would you start by looking for the space like what would be the early steps if someone in your audience actually wants to give this a try what would be like some of the yeah tomorrow this would be the first thing to do step one would be I'd create an audience in my town so I would you know local like restaurant reviews and and Hotel reviews and things like that like build a email list or Tik Tok following in my local Town once I have that then I have leverage with the merchants and I say like hey I'm thinking about creating this you know flea market meets farmers market by the way I think there's like a name that you can own there like what is that you know what is that called you know flea and farmer I know put it together farmer flee to mouth yeah yeah something like that and you know if I was able to pull pull this together and get hundreds of people to come on a Saturday would this be of interest and that's all you need you just need them to say yes and then once you have five or eight or 12 of those you go to the the the city and there's there's always someone or town and there's always someone there who's like their job is is Commerce and in my little town in Canada uh that I'm that I'm that I'm in um I actually met with like the government official and and he was just like you you'd be surprised you can like walk right in and into the town hall you know these are small towns and and uh and just be like hey like is you know in this case like is Deni around and and you just like have a chat with him and and and you'd be how the these these people are open to having conversations with citizens or people who live there um and uh and then and then you get them to support it in some in some way and then once you have both sides it's then then you you you know I don't think you're going to need that much of your own cash to uh to actually get this going so it has a lot of the ingredients I like for a business idea doesn't require a lot of cash to get going it's something that could be replicated um it's it's there's also probably an opportunity to create like the brand for for this Cate for this type of experience like for example in New York I think they have something called schoras Borg have you heard about this I've heard the word schoras Borg but not the the event I think it's like uh you know someone's gonna kill me on this because I'm getting it wrong but it's basically like in Brooklyn and a few other places I think there's just like you know a huge huge almost like a food truck festival all the different schoras Borg of food and there's it's kind of like this in some ways but then it becomes a brand you know it's like oh you going to sh MarBorg this week you're going toborg and they're able to like you know if they opened one up in Portland Oregon I'm sure uh that would get Buzz as well another another example of someone who's done this by the way is Timeout so they have these timeout like food halls where they went to um like the popular but Landmark food institutions in cities and then they create like a uh what's it called the food court so instead of having like Subway and McDonald's it it's it's like the the local scharman that everyone knows in the town yeah yeah I remember I think I was in like Sweden recently and I and I was looking there was like this timeout food court and I was like what the why timeout timeout what I didn't get the connection with the magazine and so for me I just had no idea what that meant it's like I'm going to take a little break take little time out uh okay so this idea is super interesting I have the boring agency that can go along with it so let's say the hold co uh that creates this farmers market will have another business we'll own another business which is like the business that you can hire to help you basically invent and conceptualize and create the logistics around events like this this I honestly think if you had like one of the most difficult things to do I'm going I'm flying to paloalto in a couple of weeks to run a training event and selling the event and the tickets are like 10K each was a 100 times easier than arranging the event and organizing it and getting the catering sorted and in the end we spent approximately 30,000 it probably be more than $30,000 uh to get it all organized and we couldn't find anyone to help us with this we ended up almost doing every element of it ourselves or at least we didn't find any influencer or brand or YouTube channel that talks about setting up events in a way that it would make us reach out to them and contact them and I was thinking just when you were talking there is we need the Greg Eisenberg or we need the you know specific INF we need me for in the facilitation world but for event management which is first of all seen as a job no one really wants to do and it's like always in the top lists of most stressful jobs to do as well but it is a thing that a lot of companies want to do events especially now postco a lot of companies want to go back to doing more in-person things and it is really difficult to find anyone to help with that to help with the logistics literally the the brief would have been we're running an event in paloalto it's four days long uh there's this many people can you [ __ ] help us figure this out and like we'll give you a 10K commission whatever the commission is on the on the thing uh and we couldn't find anybody so we did it ourselves so for this uh idea that you have it would be amazing if you as the entrepreneur if you were starting it could call up event inperson Co and say hey Greg like we're thinking about doing this thing in this town uh I really do not want to be involved in the logistics of it for the first one at least can you do like an event Sprint for us and get it off the ground next time we'll do it all ourselves because you'll have connected us with all the people but how do we get this event off the ground can you do an event Sprint for us like that type of company desperately needs to exist someone who is very good at organizing stuff and enjoys that and gets pleasure out of it needs to start an event management company that isn't a website with pictur of big speakers and PA systems on it it's a it's a person it's a video of a person showing you how to do it all yourself Greg content style but for event management honestly I think it would be a game changer I think you could start it in basically every city and these people will be booked out forever yeah yeah so there are experiential agencies that do like you know if you're uh Evon and you want to you know throw an event at you know Wimbledon there's big agencies that do that a buddy of mine owns one I think he does like 30 million a year in Revenue um oh my God those are like these like brand activation things right yeah so that exists um but you know I think for smaller companies um more like new types of events like the ones we're talking doesn't exist and I wonder what you can do also on the business model to make it different and interesting like maybe you can do like rev shares and maybe you can make it a product IED service and some capacity so there's a lot there's a lot

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
like anytime you have any industry anywhere in the world where somebody's using a spreadsheet it should be like you know a light bulb going off as like this is a startup opportunity one of the other kind of like Universal rules of startups is that like once you aggregate users in a place you know in some digital property you can add I love it because it's one of those things where a wedge is something that it starts off as this like cute profitable little thing but it has the leg to become something big if you want it the way you can be with any network is you carve off a section of it of like power users of some sort some Niche and you build better features for them or something like that okay let's do let's do a bonus framework with Brett bonus framework all right so it's called the Enterprise workflow startup idea formula all right so you're going to use this formula to come up with any uh startup idea that can be Venture scale billion dollar company uh and guess is what it is you know what it [Music] is all right BR Goldstein I think you're criminally underf followed that's why I brought you on today whenever we hang out I love I love just picking your brain you've you know you were part of the Google m&a team you bought companies at Google you did a startup you raised 12 million plus for that you did the VC thing and now you're working in stealth and and working on a really cool product but you're not here to talk about any of that you're here to talk startup ideas and I'm excited uh I'm excited that you agreed to come on yeah I'm excited as well we're just gonna give away all of the goods that I've been hoarding for years uh now that I'm working on something else but yeah super excited yeah I I was I said you can't hoard anymore you got to stop hoarding it's just not fair yeah I mean I think it's also just the most the best expression of your self-confidence and status to give away um stuff for free that is like extremely valuable or you could benefit immensely from keeping it to yourself so here here I am pump pumping my bags totally and I think someone's going to take one of these ideas and they might be bigger than you and me and couple years because they're taking one of these ideas yeah well selfishly I hope that some of these ideas get taken because I need some of them right now all right well what's on your mind what's idea number one okay so I guess idea number one is goes to this uh crappy startup idea that every kid in college has coming out of college they're like 22 and the first idea they come up with is what it's it's an app to help you hang out with people when you're bored and all of these apps have failed like all of them have failed like they just don't work there's this negative selection bias where it's like the people who actually want to hang out are not the people you want to hang out with and like all of this stuff but before we landed on the idea that I'm working on right now in stealth we actually pursued something that is an iteration of this idea that will actually work really really well uh and the idea is that instead of focusing on uh nerdy looners in big cities that want to hang out and weren't invited to parties as your target audience you focus on um conference attendees conference attendees and the idea is that if you've ever been to a conference whether it's like Tech week some crypto conference whatever it is you know most of the action is not actually the the main conference events all of the action is the side events and actually maybe the more of the action is and like the the private dinners and stuff like that but really the side events are where the action is that's where all the cool people are hanging out that's they're more interesting uh they're in more interesting places like I went to one during Tech week and Testo was there you know um so all these they're all these side events but the problem with all the side events is that there aren't they aren't centralized in one place usually what happens today is you have some poor soul who Aggregates a spreadsh sheet um of all these side events their crossplatform it's Luma it's party full it's Eventbrite it's all this stuff and it's in this really shitty spreadsheet and you have to go through and click through all the ones that look interesting rsbp to them you have all this annoying emails confirming and all this stuff um but I think the really important Point uh to focus on is the spreadsheet like anytime you have any industry anywhere in the world where somebody's using a spreadsheet it should be like you know a light bulb going off as like this is a startup opportunity there's countless startups that started as spreadsheets or took processes that were spreadsheets and then converted them into uh products and so really the simple simplest thing is you go and you find these spreadsheets ahead of these conferences or during these conferences you build some scraper some system to ingest all of that data uh parse you know the dates the times the s other information images about these events and then you create a beautiful app that plots them on a map one click RSVP um and basically that's your wedge your wedge is this is the place you're going to go to see where all the conference events are right um when we tried this at I think we did it this at like nfnc or something we built a very crappy version of this people were just Like Loving It people clamored for it like people said thank you so much can I get my friend on it all that stuff but where does this turn into an app to find friends to meet up with conferences are designed for people to meet up and hang out like literally the whole point of the conference is for professional networking to happen for you to go and find that person who's at the conference and go grab coffee or whatever or do business and stuff like that so these people are very like of anybody in the world these people are like the most authentically interested in connecting and chatting and like meeting up in person because that's what they're there for and actually unlike the social world the so you know a non uh professional space where you you have negative selection bias of like the nerdiest weird weirdest people being the only ones who want to hang out um this is actually everyone right hi status low status whoever so that's the first thing that's the first solution or the first problem that you've solved is you have great people who want to hang out quick ad break let me tell you about a business I invested in it's called boring marketing.com so a few years ago I met this group of people that were some of the best SEO experts in the world they were behind getting some of the biggest companies found on Google and the secret sauce is they've got a a set of technology and AI that could help you outrank your competition so for my own businesses I wanted that I didn't want to have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I didn't want to depend on ads to drive customers to my businesses I wanted to rank high in Google that's why I like SEO and that's why I use boring marketing.com and that's why I invested in it they're so confident in their approach that they offer a 30-day Sprint with 100% money back guarantee who does that nowadays so check it out highly recommend boring marketing.com every conference organizer is trying to get people to meet up because they know that people will come back if if that matchmake happens so and by the way you know I know some people are listening to this and they're and they're like okay like how much money is there really in this space um and you know there's a business called Cent do you know cent no I had never heard of them and but they're basically uh a four and a half billion dollar company I think they're publicly traded actually and what they do is they have a white label app for events and conferences yeah exactly you talked about a wedge which is a really good you know I I think people don't think about wedges enough but I think this is a wedge to ultimately compete with Cent four and a half billion dollar opportunity and Cent by the way like you know you'll go to their website we can show it on YouTube like this is like an old school kind of yeah you know it's not like the designers of Snapchat went and design let's put it that way yeah must must be at least like 10 15 years old but yeah but yeah I think like you know one of the other kind of like Universal rules of startups is that like once you aggregate users in a place you know in some digital property you can add social features right pretty standard operating procedure you build an amazing one player experience which is what it's the uh find any conference event you know Side Event at this conference and the two-player experience is suddenly everyone who's at that conference is available in a directory and you can DM them and you don't have to worry about sharing your phone number with some random you know professional contact if you don't want to um you may be able to share your location which is something that has also failed miserably in the social world like what if you want to connect with somebody but you guys are bouncing around between all these different events it's a great opportunity to share share locations and stuff like that so that's so the wedge is the one player experience the next step is the the directory and the chat right you could even do some like crazy AI features where you uh train uh an llm on all the conference information oh where is checkin like what's you know you know when is this speaker going or like what's the status of this event these are questions people are constantly sending conference organizers and stuff like that but you can throw that literally in the same chat UI as everything else um and all this stuff is like you know you could build this in a month or less but yeah what's what's nice about this is you have this group of people who it are basically the power users of professional networking right so one of the things you want to if you want if you wanted backing up if you wanted to compete with LinkedIn you can carve off a you the way you could be with any network is you carve off a section of it of like extremely power users of some sort some Niche and you build better features for them or something like that and so if you think about power professional networkers like the people who are on LinkedIn the hardest are probably the same people who are going to these conferences and dying to meet up right so s suddenly you have this directory of people they've added their work history they've added their interests maybe you can search through send DMS to people you sell ads into in it which is like hey come to the you know advertisers can be like hey come to this event or or try this new thing or something like that that um and yeah obviously it works cross event cross uh conference as well so once you're on this for one conference if you're going to another conference which most people do you just open the app again and you see who's there totally that that's the uh the magic experience of the shop app have you ever have you ever downloaded that app yeah so it's the it's shopify's app and I recently downloaded and if you ask me Greg how many Shopify purchases have you made I would say like I don't know two um you don't really know that you're making Shopify purchases because it's the back end it's powering these e-commerce experiences so I downloaded the app and then I saw like I don't know 50 different you know companies I bought stuff from yeah and it was such a magical experience I'd love to be able to open this app and be like oh my God I didn't know that Brett is going to be at you know South by Southwest and you know so I think that's I I I do think that having that magical sort of experience is cool if you were building something like this and I mean you built the product so I'm sure You' thought thought about this how would you actually get to like how would you get awareness and in something like this yeah I mean I think you know conferences are are a historically fantastic place to Launch products South by Southwest itself is like known to you I I guess it's not anymore but it used to be this place where like yeah everyone anticipated the the next social app to launch and so um it's one of these things where it's like it has a strong Network effect especially with these social features which is like you host an event at a South by Southwest or a tech Curr or a tech week or something like that um these events if you're in their distribution system system get tons and tons of RSVPs we hosted one for Tech week 800 uh RSVPs 800 people all down I'll download your app conferences are probably no more than like 20,000 people at in the the largest sense so once you have that 800 people you just do the next conference that these people are going to that's probably how I do it obviously you know you're targeting particular niches so you may want to start with the crypto Community or something because these people tend to like hop from one conference to another pretty consistently um you may want us Target like the Tech Community or another specific group of people that tends to show up consistently at these conferences but um yeah I think that's yeah how it work cool I like this idea I think it's one you know I love a wedge man I love a wedge salad you know so this to me is a wedge salad and a half yeah um I love it because it's one of those things where a wedge is something that it starts off as this like cute profitable little thing but it has the legs to become something big if you want it yeah so that's what that's why I like this idea uh yeah one one last one interesting point is that uh conferences are actually where most people spend their Learning and Development budget um at their companies they're usually getting like2 to $3,000 a year or something like that these workers these Tech workers or any sort of worker most of them spend it at conferences this is why conference tickets are so expensive because obviously the conference grounds are expensive but like they're more so expensive because these corporate people have the money to spend on them and so it's interesting is that means that this app because it has a you know a business focus it's conference focused um people can expense it in their Learning and Development budget which means you have the potential right out of the gate you know you can gate some of these features the AI chatbot information stuff some of the like maybe some of the like social features or something you get some features and you could charge 50 bucks a month or something like that 100 bucks 250 bucks for one conference if you wanted to and I think you'd see adoption before we go on to the next idea I have to ask why didn't you proceed with this idea idea we came up with a even bigger idea okay okay yeah it wasn't it wasn't the idea itself that you you looked at it and you're like oh my God you know this is really hard it was just there's another opportunity and you went for that no yeah I think this is a pretty clear-cut straightforward thing I mean you have to be excited about conferences you have to be you know in this kind of like multi-chapter you know story of like first we're doing the wedge and that and it's going to take some time um but yeah we just came up with a better idea cool all right Brett what's uh what's idea number two um all right so I have two the next two ideas are both dating related because I'm hopelessly single in New York um and I find that people just kind of talk about don't you feel like when you're hanging out with people in a certain city they kind of talk about whatever the whatever the thing of the city seems to be so it's like you hang out with people in San Francisco they're only talking about the latest AI models and stuff like that you hang out with people in New York where dating is like a sport basically conversations naturally go back to dating I have a couple ideas that I think would be super super killer the first one is basically a vertical sass for matchmakers so the main point is that like there are people in every community and this is like a Thousand-Year old job who play this role of Matchmaker like particularly in like like we're both Jewish the Jewish matchmakers Indian matchmakers like you know any sort of religious or ethnic Community there are strong matchmakers but what I also find interesting is that like uh there are other communities uh and you're the community guys you I want to hear your thoughts on this but like there are other communities that have emerged or have their own identities that also should or already have match Mak makers within it so rock climbing like you would think that rock climbers would get along with each other and be a good match you would think that crossfitters would get along you'd think that like you know people on Twitter would get along with each other right do you have any thoughts on that I want before I go I want to get your yeah so you're you're absolutely right I also think that you know 50% of uh genzi Americans are not religious at all so they're looking for they're attaching themselves to to some of these movements and these movements have become their identity so absolutely I think you know a non-obvious one would be the so the sobriety movement you know yes I want to connect with other sober daters in my city and who subscribe to the same philosophy and ident and identity that I have yep yep exactly and I just to confirm I'm I'm not sober and I have a wife you know yeah yeah yeah yeah got it that was that was an example I thought you said you're not sober now I'm like I I didn't get the memo oh no I'm sober right at this right now but I might have a glass of wine tonight you know yeah yeah yeah yeah same yeah but yeah I think like you know you think about like all these people who and if you talk to people in couples like one of the things that people like to do in their spare time is get their friends who are not married married like it's like it's like a classic pastime of couples to do that and so there's this there's this all this Demand right like there's these dating apps but they don't actually support um this kind of like third player to be involved in this process you think about like what is the user flow of a Matchmaker it's like you have a database of people and then you have all these traits and then you need some sort of UI to be able to pair them up and you need some sort of double opt in to get them to go and get go on the date and stuff so there's this whole like a lot of different ways to do this you could charge the Matchmaker where you where you basically say like you pay 30 bucks a month for these features and 150 a month for these features um you could also charge in terms of like a if you wanted to do like Community Based you could almost charge like a transaction fee so imagine if um the like there was like a Jewish Matchmaker in New York or something and I had to pay like 50 bucks a month to be part of her pool right everyone pays 50 bucks a month or maybe there's some discriminate discriminatory pricing based on gender or something like that by the way there's probably a way to do that just for with religious groups so that it's tax deductible too oh that's a great that's a really good point right smart yeah yeah definitely becomes a no-brainer right yeah yeah yeah you just have to do a little like prayer before every right swipe yeah but um yeah you charge you charge some amount maybe the Jewish one is 50 maybe another one who 150 maybe uh you're a celebrity in the LA area and you have access to all these billionaires and celebrities and all these crazy models and whatever whatever those types of people are and you charge you know $5,000 a month or $10,000 a month for it to be part of that pool um and then you take you know the company takes a percentage of that um that subscription or something like that you know what this reminds me of have you seen pallet no what was New York startup I I actually invested in it a few years ago or lay check out invested in a few years ago but the basic idea of pallet uh it's pallet.com oh is the job board yeah it's job board for creators basically so like they'll work with like Al Lenny ritky uh who's like the product management guy and they'll be like hey we're gonna power your job board uh for Lenny jobs yeah and uh they they provide the you know the the technology and and they have a Fe structure that I I assume that they get like a percentage Yeah so this is basically that right the the thinking is like they so they're going after creators and people with big influence and different niches you're you're you're saying kind of the same thing um and recruiting in some ways is very similar to dating it's the same for sure yeah it's the same yeah totally yeah and I think what's interesting about this is like dating as a space to invest in always gets a bad rep because it it it like the incentive structures make it so it's never going to be a massive business aside from Tinder maybe it's turned into a giant business over time but like you know if the app works then you turn from it um but I think the way that you know in this sense you're almost like changing you're creating almost like a unlimited upside like you know it could be as expensive as uh as the person decides if if they're doing that model so that means you could make a lot more money uh from this I also like so Shopify I know I just brought them up but I'm bringing up them again they have this philosophy called arming the rebels which is oh yeah yeah yeah just such a such a good concept around they've got all these Rebels quote unquote who are merchants and then their job is to arm them with tools and software to make their lives easier and better what what I like about this business is it's arming the rebels which are these nonformal matchmakers these casual matchmakers that are doing this out of the the goodness of their heart anyways yeah all you're doing that with with this is you're just arming them to make their lives easier and if they want to have upside and and maybe the upside you know some people are going to be like no I'm just doing this out of goodness of my heart and bless their hearts we need more of those people yeah but some people are going to be you know so so for those people you know maybe you have it so you can it donates to a charity of your choice or something like that yeah taxes up to dble again yeah and it's interesting if you think about like what actually is a dating app what are the new what is the the way that you would start a new dating app is you find a niche you find a an A specific group of people and and then maybe there's some special mechanism but the group of people matters more than the mechanism right any dating app you're on like Rya is like these type of people Tinder is these type of people like the the whole evolution of dating apps is just about like slicing off another Niche so really what this product is talking you know the point of this product is to productize that process of taking a niche and turning it into a dating app very quickly yeah I like this one a lot you know on this podcast I've been doing something new and I and I say do I do I sip an idea I I do I like this idea or do I spit this idea I don't like it and you know go back to the drawing board and I I definitely spit this idea you're you're just you're doing something you're productizing that people are already doing and you're just making it easier for them so I like it um and uh I also think there's that Trend around a bit of message fatigue on a lot of these dating apps like people are kind of for something like this so you have the tail of that as well yeah and I find that you actually treat um you treat matches more seriously when they come from friends or community members versus like you know the open abyss of New York City or something like that so I think it would have a much higher conversion rate to actual marriage and stuff totally and I could see the the quote on your website now now yeah dope all right second dating app let's let's rock what do you got second dating app all right you're in the flow I can I can see it I can see you're in the we're in the flow let's start with the I I'll paint a picture of this dating app from the landing page starting with the landing page so the app is called Serendipity you go to the app you go to the website maybe it's a enough but call it a website very mysterious like very intense branding and it says something like we've perfected the the ancient craft of uh finding life Partners finding people life Partners the ancient mystical scientific craft right and on the website you'd be exposed to the the process which is first you have to fill out all this information and give us as much information as possible we need to know who you are on a soul level right so you're you take this survey and it's asking just weird questions like would you rather uh you know interview an iguana or a raccoon just like the most absurd strangest questions that you can imagine this is partially like a growth tactic because people will be like I'm I'm joining this dating app and it's like asking me the most ridiculous questions I've ever seen in my life well I I could I could picture the the viral Tik toks with two million views yeah right people screen sharing that yeah and so yes 100% yes yes yeah and then you get to the end you have to you have to link your accounts link your Instagram link your LinkedIn everything just like information sharing oversharing because the message is we have this we have this tool we have figured it out fundamental human unlock to find you your life partner so you're like whatever I'll do it all get to the bottom and then you finish and then it basically says um our council is now going to be reviewing your um your information and who's on the council a monk a priest a uh relationship and sex psychologist or doctor or something like that um physic physicist right a rabbi like all of these all of these kind of like mystical you know really intense types of figures and you see their faces and they're old and they're like you know you see the wisdom in their eyes and you're like oh man like these people are reading my stuff and they're going to find my my life partner and then it says thank you we're reviewing your stuff um it'll take some time literally months will go by maybe obviously not great for conversion but it's more about the vibe months go by you forget about it then you get a text message that says hey we finally found your life partner we found them they they exist they live in your city we have found them but we are not going to tell you who they are or where they are you have to find them yourself uh we believe that love happens serendipitously right and so the way the way you have to find them is that you get text messages or something um basically with hints about where they may be right specifically where but maybe there's like some probably not much information around there like who what they look like or anything like that but where is the key point so one night you'll get a text that's like hey um she is uh most likely going to be at a cocktail bar in SoHo with you know red trim on the chairs or something and then you're when you're deciding where to go with your friends that night you're like okay let's just see if this cocktail bar has anything interesting you go to the cocktail bar and what is what's your feeling like what what is excit what is your heart telling you when you get to that cocktail bar maybe you're like I don't know if I believe this thing but part part of you wants to believe it part of you wants to believe that life partner is there and you're going to be very openhearted when you talk to these people at this bar you may go up to people you may stay there a little longer you may hang out and all that stuff and I think what's interesting about this that idea this idea like okay if you're if you're there looking for a life partner or think that somebody could be your life partner there you're going to treat everybody a lot differently and it actually doesn't matter if your life partner is there or not because you may actually find somebody you really connect with but you know because you are much more receptive and open and stuff and so the the secret this may be more of like a social experiment than an actual business idea but um the secret is the council doesn't have to exist right the council doesn't have to be real the life partner doesn't have to exist the most important thing is that you need to send your users these people to the same place to find each other right so like it'd be even better if you were able to maybe the more capitalist version of this is like you find a bunch of characteristics of of all these people who take this survey you know relative attractiveness education interests all that stuff and then every night over on the weekends you send them people with similar interests to the same bar to just connect and find each other so what do you think social experiment or actual product idea definitely the craziest idea on your and you know here's what I here's what I like about the idea and I think this applies to other ideas too so to me this feels very much like turning something that is not a treasure hunt into a treasure hunt yes and I think that thesis could be applied to a bunch of different spaces so for people listening who are like okay Brett's crazy with this dating app idea but you know this concept applied to something else maybe it's e-commerce maybe I don't know what it is but something in another space I think that's really really interesting so that's what I really like about this idea yeah I think another another kind of interesting framework about this is that like the reason the reason dating feels icky to people is the same reason why like the app that helps people hang out when their board doesn't work is because when it's too on the nose it's too Direct right like I'm am single I'm on a dating app to date um there's some negative selection bias and weird feelings versus when you're one degree removed and you're like oh I'm just going to this party or I'm just going to this conference event but I actually really want this lower level human thing it eliminates the negative selection bias it allows you to have like higher status more desirable people in the mix and all that stuff how would you actually go about building something like this like is this something is this hard to build is it is it easy to build MVP wise the social experiment part's easy it's like you throw a type form on a website you blast it out to as many people as you can dating related things are usually pretty viral and people are pretty ex excited about um them I have a friend who runs a dating like a matchmaking company and he created this like landing page that showed like you basically say what your preferences are in somebody it's like religion age height and then it calculates how many people of those how how many people exist and it went super viral it got millions of like impression millions of views how was your friend that was the person I I saw that around I W someone who's 65 and higher Works in finance and makees more than $100,000 a year that's that was your friend it got like yeah tens of millions of impress question yeah what's funny is that was actually the second thing like that he he had already released this thing and it got all this press this website you can go to to type those things in and then they just jumped on the like 65 whatever that train that Meme train so could be as simple as that cool yeah I like I also the other thing I like about this idea is people will you know you want to start an idea that people will pay for and people are used to paying for dating match m match matchmaking and uh so if it if it does go viral like who knows what you have on your hands it could be really big yeah sweet all right ready ready to go into Enterprise land okay yeah I could I could gears I could shift gears and and do a huge uh you know R yeah let's let's see what you got okay this is a very like half baked idea but it's um something I've been feeling lately is there are a lot of crms and marketing automation platforms that kind of rely on having extremely high quality data so that you can segment and do various marketing campaigns or all this various stuff um and I think and obviously llms have kind of unlocked a new way to extract data from unstructured information like podcasts YouTube videos like all of this stuff and so I used to work at clearbit clearbit was a is like a data enrichment company it's an API you plug in a domain it gives you a bunch of data points about the company you plug in an email address it gives you a bunch of data points about a person what was hard about clearbit is like there's all this just like work to get each of those data points perfect and it took a really long time and then at the end of the day you only had those data points you didn't have anything else if you wanted something more unique it's special you couldn't get it and so what I'm imagining is kind of like a new kind of clear bit which is like um a flexible Knowledge Graph API where you basically put in a company name or something and then you list the data points that you're looking for and then you know you will have indexed you know you'll have embedded like all podcasts LinkedIn you know you can buy total you could buy a LinkedIn data dump if you wanted embed LinkedIn you embed a bunch of tweets you embed uh all these news sources and stuff like that and then use that to kind of fill these data points on the Fly for people so if you wanted to like doing a do a marketing automation push using this API for like um people in New York or people who said they were going to come to the techr or the New York Tech week um you know how would you find that data through an API like this because it would have all that information kind of embedded automatically and then how do you charge for it and how would you actually how would you actually build something like this like how do you go from idea to tox execution yeah I mean so building is pretty straightforward because you're basically like putting everything in a data warehouse and embedding everything in terms of the actual nitty-gritty AI stuff beyond that that it's beyond my pay grade but yeah I think for charging it's pretty easy you can charge per enrichment so clear bit and others cost like up to 50 cents per per contact enrichment so you know you do the math 100,000 contact enrichments is $50,000 which can be pretty lucrative um but I think the key with this would be to charge a little less than Zoom info or another player and then probably have just more flexibility and interesting data and stuff to provide and is this a venture-backed idea or do you think this could be bootstrapped it could be either I would probably want to do it bootstrapped because data is a really hard hard space like you know zoom in just data if you're selling data it's just a tough business because it's always going to be about like is this data better than the other data and you can get some of this stuff off the ground pretty easily I I have friends who run there are a handful of these startups that have popped up um that do some sort of data enrichment um in the post AI world and they have gotten to you know 203k Mr pretty quickly just from basically selling csvs that's insane yeah CS it depends on what's in the CSV if it's it's good stuff and they're using llms and AI you know for some of that yeah yeah so apparently when clearbit added L llms to their whole mix they had data points that went from being like 30% accurate to like 95% accurate so pretty big um pretty obvious opportunity and I think the other thing is as more people are building apps that need data underlying it like for example like if you're building a if we're building this app we talked about in the beginning the conference app wouldn't it be nice if we had a bio for everyone if we had their social profiles if we had other Dynamic information about them in this app you wouldn't be able to do that um there's no affordable API for that right now yeah and the data is out there no one wants to put it in it's just you just need a little enrichment in your life yep I think uh this works I you know I think this works really well for certain groups and certain um you know very specific niches um what do you think are two three four five specific groups that would use something like this well I think what's interesting is like the data the data companies are not incentivized to go after a lot of a lot of niches right so if you wanted to start like um you know a Sri Lankan real estate CRM or marketing automation platform and you needed to have a lot of information about you know the building location and like the number of rooms or all that stuff like you would need to build that data set yourself or hope that users input it and the magic of this is that because you're using llms because you're kind of crawling the web a little bit or you're finding data sets online or other places that you can point llms to is that you can do you can Target almost any Niche um much better than these kind of like incumbents can so yeah Shri Lan and real estate like I don't know I don't know why I thought of that that's the task if you're listening to this figuring out what are these groups what are you know who needs enrichment who's who's going to be willing to pay for it but you're right this is this is like a an obvious idea um and I love this idea I sip this idea greatly just because you are right with incumbents aren't they're not going to be everywhere and and and that's that's the opportunity that's why you don't raise money for something like this you build it profitably and you know you could get to a situation where you're doing one to three million AR or something like that and you go to um a clear bit or someone like that and you sell the business what do you think you know what are what sort of multiples you know you've worked in the Google m&a world like what sort of multiples are are some of these businesses getting not much so I like it depends on the approach like the clearbit acquisition clearbit was acquired by HubSpot and the rumor is that it was not the most amazing price because HubSpot didn't value the existing business HubSpot is not in a in a data enrichment business they bought it so they can have data enrichment out of the box in their own CRM and have this kind of competitive mode based on that so they bought it for the capabilities they bought it for the for the data not the business so when you are selling a company like you need to know what the acquirer wants in your company the best deals are ones where they're buying the whole business because that means you're getting traditional like whatever the relevant multiple is based on public comps other Acquisitions and other kind of fundraises um but if they're not building buying it based on a business then it's kind of like I don't know it's totally random sometimes yeah yeah I think um this is probably one of those ideas that you might just want to cash flow it and if you get an unreasonably good offer from one of you know one of these platforms like let them come to you don't you know don't run a process yourself because you're right the multiples especially which with dependence on some of these llms might not be amazing yeah exactly exactly Brett you crushed it wait you want to do this you want to do this last it's not a it's not a startup idea it's just a framework Qui okay let's do let's do a bonus framework with Brett bonus framework all right so it's called the Enterprise workflow idea startup formula or startup idea formula Enterprise workflow startup idea formula all right so you're going to use this formula to come up with any uh startup idea that can be a venture scale billion dollar company every five years you can rebuild this company uh and guess I'm salv salv no I'm salivating right now okay so you basically take any workflow that a professional does so like designers design like marketers do email marketing salespeople live in a CRM uh Engineers have ticket management system you see where I'm going with this right like documents like all this type of stuff all these like core workflow tools need to get rebuilt every five to 10 years why is that because the technology gets better right the people all people always want the same thing they want it to be beautiful they want to look like the tools that they use with their consumer products they wanted to have the latest in greatest technology and all that stuff and the reality is incumbents are never going to be able to adapt quickly to these changes and stuff this is this is the linear formula linear didn't build a brain exploding ticket management system they built a ticket management system that was simpler number one more beautiful number two more targeted at a very specific Niche number three uh more performant and that's it like that that's it like they are killing Trello they're killing jira um they're going to replace those in even large Enterprises as well and they didn't have to build the craziest most advanced stuff it's not like a it's not like 10-dimensional chess kind of product visionary stuff it's like literally just build it better so you can do this with most types of things um it's even easier when you focus on a niche so if you wanted to build a a CRM for real estate people like there's a CRM for realate people called follow-up boss that's like 15 years old if you wanted to replace them you could just following kind of this this formula this is a gift you've given people a literal gift pretty great it's pretty great works I'm gonna I'm GNA write that down and uh appreci I appreciate you sharing that with everyone Brett um this has been an absolute pleasure uh where could people learn more about you uh LinkedIn and Twitter I would say or maybe the newsletter so LinkedIn is uh SLB Goldstein 3 Twitter is that guy DG and then the newsletter is homec screen . newws and if You' made it this far in the Pod if you're on YouTube least you can do is subscribe give

my take on this is that every person has a ignorance tax that they have to pay down so no matter what your goals are there's a price that you have to pay to learn to get to your goals quicker and by living in San Francisco New York some of these places yes it's might be two times more expensive to live but you will just by as osmosis pay down your ignorance debt way way way faster [Music] J cream is back hey time to sip time to sip you haven't been you haven't been on the show in like three weeks so you're just like super super electric about it I was so sick I got covid got that bat flu right in my brain and it just really messed me up it stopped me from being sharp there's nothing more scary as an entrepreneur especially if you're running your own businesses than your brain moving slower than usual I think I don't know if you've ever had something like that where you get it you get sick or something happens and you become more stupid no nothing my my brain is never slow and is never stupid it just hasn't happened ever yet that's just the standard uh speed for you right I just take a a sip and I'm back I'm back back where I need to be well you Americans right and I was really thinking about that this week you Americans are all like you've got this Zin stuff yeah I actually don't know if it's a patch or if it's chewing if it's a chewing gum no Zin is the rage in in in America it's basically like a it looks like a um piece of gum and people put it like on their lip it's just like it's a ni [Music] thing it's a little bag that you put up here yeah oh okay a lot of people in uh the Nordic countries use that too but not for productivity because hey guess what nobody from Nordic companies is going to be watching or countries is going to be watching this show for productivity ain't the thing but uh yeah I was thinking I was literally like maybe I need to start taking some of these powerful concoctions of stuff that Americans take to get work done um but yeah in the end I just ended up waiting till I didn't have Co anymore but I do have some fun topic I I do have one main topic for you today I think it's like I when I saw this and I've been looking into it for a couple of weeks I was thinking okay your audience a couple of people in your audience are going to be smart enough and hustle enough to take this and actually turn this into a business um and it's based on I was so I'm in a couple of different entrepreneurial groups and one of the groups I was in I was listening to the call last week again I was like out of my head with Co just like slow sweaty whatever but I was listening to this woman and she was getting help with a with a marketing challenge she was talking for a while and eventually I was just like I'm really sorry do you mind if I ask you how much your coaching program costs and she said oh yeah yeah it's $38,000 per year and I was like what the [ __ ] what do you how and the reason I was so shocked is because what she's selling is she's selling a program it's not an online course it's like a kind of one-year program of coaching to teachers who don't want to be teachers anymore and who want to transition out of that career into being something else and then I was like okay wait a minute there are a lot of different careers that people are in and they probably don't know that they can take their skills and turn them into something else and get a different job a lot of people get burnt out from teaching a lot of people realize like from their perspective when it's too late that they actually don't like it and it's a super super popular thing for people if you look at it so I started Googling it then I looked at her website maybe I shouldn't I don't know maybe I shouldn't tell people about her specific website on this uh thing because I'm sharing things from within my entrepreneur group that would be maybe get me kicked out of that group but she spend she there there's a couple of companies that do something like this for example there's if you just start googling t teacher transition uh new career there's one called teaching transition Academy there's things like that and these are super high ticket programs where not not all of them are high ticket some of them are lower ticket but where essentially you know a team of people will help you figure out what you can do next and what I love about it is that this is something that so I run a company called ajn smart.com we help people become facil facilitators and we realize one of the most powerful things that we do is we help people go from where they are which is usually like product management ux design project management to something well more like facilitation which is what they specifically want to do but looking at this I was like you could literally take almost any job like nursing uh teaching I still think is really underserved I was looking at it you could even look at Consultants who go and work at Mackenzie and then realize they don't like it you could also look at things that are getting like laid off like product managers really think about how could you actually help this person get in and especially if they're later in life maybe they don't they already have a family maybe they're already kind of locked down to where they live how could you actually find something that could help these people a program that could help these people or could you figure out an easy thing that they could retrain themselves on and honestly that can be a Killer Business and I was just shocked shed when I was talking to her and she was like [Music] $38,000 Teachers Pay $38,000 usually spread out over the 12 months but I was completely shocked that this was I I I honestly expected her to say maximum $3,000 maximum hey everyone if you're anything like me you've got a ton of design work that you need websites landing pages emails social clets you name it but you don't just want beautiful landing pages or beautiful websites you want the stuff that's going to convert you want the stuff that's going to actually drive value that's where design scientist.com comes in it's an agency that for one monthly price will do all your design work all your copy work all your engineering and do stuff that actually scales your Revenue you don't need a designer you need a design scientist let's go design scientist.com I liked it so much I invested in the business so so what you're saying is there's a bunch of careers that I mean most careers honestly there people don't like there's a there's a subsection of people who don't like what they're doing and there's an opportunity to get those people to create content to attract those people and then sell coaching and other services to help them transition from what they're doing to what they want to be doing that's what you're saying I think there's a couple of nuances to it that I would focus on if I was starting this business I would focus on people who are who already have kids who are already settled down where they live maybe their kids are just like starting to move out maybe they're starting to realize maybe this career isn't for me so I wouldn't be targeting anybody like under 45 or maybe like it would be more like 40 and above they'll also have more money to spend as well so there'll be more they'll have felt the pain also of being in the industry that they don't like for a long period of time and so I think that's why teaching is such a an amazing Target like teachers often I know a lot of teachers they get to the certain point when they're like 35 36 37 my sister for example when she was 33 she transitioned into facilitation I think it takes a while for her them to realize oh [ __ ] like my salary is going to go up really slowly I can already see I already know what salary is going to be when I'm retiring and this is what it's going to be like forever and I think there are a lot of different jobs like that teaching is just one of the most obvious but immediately for me what I'm always thinking is what would I do if AJ and smart failed and one of the most obvious things after hearing the price of her coaching program was well I'd probably look for jobs that people feel stuck in I I do feel like it has to be the pain that they have to feel is that they're stuck and that their skills are not transferable right you don't want to be getting so you don't want to be targeting like people like you and me who are like full stack marketer entrepreneurs who can kind of do anything you want to be targeting people who spent their entire year building towards one career and their entire life building towards one career and then you can actually help them gain the confidence to move back into the market uh into something different so I think it's it's like a career coach on Zen you know career on Zin exactly that's a good oneliner yeah and like okay so how do you build this business literally especially if you're not a teacher if I was building this well first of all you would ideally find a teacher as your potentially as your co-founder teacher who's already transitioned out another thing is so literally in one day first I would Google the [ __ ] out of it I would look at all the qu posts I was already doing this today looking at all the qu questions about how how to transition out of teaching looking at all the Reddit posts about how to transition out of teaching looking at all the different things people are doing then I'd reach out to a lot of the people who've been posting ask to interview them just gather all these ideas then of course I'd look at the competitors I'd look at all the different websites all the different things if if I'm looking at a lot of these they're fairly low quality from a trust perspective I would say they look very salesy and and like bad and so I try to I would just build a more trustworthy version of these things and go content first and who I would make the content with would be teachers who have transitioned out right I'd learn from the people who've transitioned out of being teachers and build like the best content Hub but yeah I mean you would just then try to I guess it would be some form of Education business coaching business even better if you find like the thing that they can transition into but honestly I think would be a super it would be a super powerful business to at least replace your normal day-to-day corporate salary with and you would be helping people you wouldn't be helping the kids who who you know are in the schools but you definitely fix you want to fix the education system dude you're not exactly fixing the education system but yeah I hear you I will say okay you check this out so one of the first things that I do whenever I come up with an idea is I go to Reddit and I noticed that there's a subreddit called teachers I was on this exact subreddit today you would be you would be teachers in transition okay so it's it's it's pretty massive uh it's 34,000 members it's actually a perfect size top 3% Rank by size and I one of the things I like to do is I go check the top posts so this month the top post is a post that says in case anyone questions why 50% of teachers leave in their first five years and it's basically these text messages of parents just following up cards cards so bad it's like I'm curious as to the interpretation of the grading rubric right and then there's 213 comments of other teachers being like one of the top comments I don't care about grades quote unquote and proceeds to rent about grades so I think the way to to build this is the way I would build this teachers in transition or whatever in transition is I would actually go and build um the subreddit if it doesn't exist like go and build a subreddit moderate the subreddit I would try to collect as many memes as possible and the memes is how you attract the audience you just end up sharing memes for teachers nurses you know dentists um that sort of thing get a bunch of you know thousands of followers and from there then that's when you create your high ticket offer and that's when you you know you you sell them stuff and te teaching was just an example because just there's a lot of people in my life who've quit teaching and found it very stressful and and the the stressful part is that there's a lot of fear of leaving teaching and a lot of fear of won't be able to do anything else and what that does is also makes people stay in something that that's going to burn them to the ground and eventually they end up on sick leave for well sometimes years I don't know if you know any teachers who are in that setup I do and I think that's there are a lot of people that I meet especially older people who hate what they do they absolutely hate it and sometimes people come into our programs and they're so and it wasn't it's not even the intention of what we do at our company but they're so thankful to have found something that they actually enjoy doing and they never thought they would see an alternative and I never connected even our marketing doesn't even touch on that topic but hearing somebody talk about building this teaching transition coaching business where you have multiple coaches hired don't care what you think about coaching businesses it's just an example but there are just so many people stuck in jobs like so many people stuck when they're 55 in a job they just despise but the fear the fear of not being able to do something else you can really you can create things that are just super valuable for these people but yeah this teachers in transition subreddit is the perfect place to fill yourself up on the problem teachers have it's mostly negative posts if you look at it yeah and and and basically gossip yeah you know um but it's you know if you're a teacher and you're in the subred it you you you read a post and it's it's kind of like real recognize real you know like I see you other teacher like I've been there we've all been there and if you can get that feeling that's that's basically the feeling that you want a reverse engineer the other thing I thought of is um and I found a couple of examples of this as well again all I like finding examples we talked about this with the Deep Brown noise thing it's a it's like fragmented scattered all over the Internet tiny little pockets of it but uh paid communities again paid commun for teachers who are still in teaching who are looking for essentially a support group but also maybe looking for a way out and just having like a private space where people can also share things that will help each other have an easier teaching life again this is not something I would personally pursue because I'm not interested in teaching but just watching this other lady in my entrepreneur group running it I'm like holy crap like this is genuinely you're doing a business that makes money but also takes people from being burnt out and hating their lives to genuinely feeling completely different about their Futures it's just crazy how many different jobs that fall into this category I almost can't think of a job where it wouldn't fall into this category I could even imagine if you want to go to the super high end like the very like the end game of this is what do you do when you're an entrepreneur who sold their company and you're like 40 and you're you've nothing to do anymore because you've nailed it and finished the vid the video game of business how do you transition into something else I even think that could be a cool thing to help people with I'm not there yet so I can't do it I'm just trying to think okay so what job titles need this the most and I think if you if if you think about some of these positions like teachers or dentists or even doctors doctors even yeah doctors like they spend they basically decide that they want to be these people at age like 1 Architects Architects hate their lives usually often so they might you know in their mind like you know their parents or you know they had an uncle who was a who was a dentist so they become a dentist and then by the time they're you know in their mid 20s or late 20s or early 30s they're like whoa I don't like being a therapist it's horrible people are just telling me their problems so I think a lot of job titles where there's a lot of studying and prep and long hours that's what that's what I'd go after I mean you could even simplify it down to whatever jobs require you to decide at the age of 18 that you're going to do that job the chances of you actually liking it by the time you're 36 is very low like a lot of the people in my town in Ireland uh anyone who was smart and good at math was basically told to do civil engineering I I don't think I know anyone who actually does that job now I don't even know what civil engineering means it's like engineering the engineering kind of mathematics behind like stressors on buildings and stuff like in bridges so it's like if you you study civil engineering you're you become an engineer right a civil engineer so what does that even mean I don't [ __ ] know but one of my friends is a video game designer right now I was just going to say the name of the company but I won't um and he yeah like that's an example of a transition path that not a lot of people who went into civil engineering might know about I mean in the end sometimes it's just about seeing what other people do right sometimes how you calibrate what you want to do with your life is just by looking at someone else and being like Oh yeah like I could do that with my life well it's it's the the power of M mic desire do you ever read that book I've never read that book I think it's a book I can't even say that I'm not even going to try to say it yeah it's called wanting the power of mic desire in everyday life by Luke Burgess it basically says that even if we don't realize it we do things to to to try to mimic other people in our lives and how we don't have as much like we think that we're doing things we're independent we're human beings we you know if we if we want to be a doctor it's because we want to be a doctor but we don't realize that it you know it's 99% our environment and just us trying to fit in as people I 100% believe that um that's why I also like so we talked about this before I live in Europe Europe is very laidback um you can see it from the economy but it's like it's super laidback I even live in the country with like one of the best economies in Europe I live in Germany it's so so laidback compared to the US uh from a career point of view and I do have to sometimes just get on a flight like I am in a couple of weeks and go to California just to like you know be in San Francisco be in La hang around with other Founders who are just a lot more focused and successful and like driven than me they're just on they're just on a lot more Z then you are I didn't know that dude now I know no okay some of not everyone is but I definitely learned uh I learned a lot about Zin in the last few months um yeah Americans definitely uh have a very unfair advantage of having like a lot of chemical compounds going at the same time to keep them very awake uh I don't know what whether I think that's a good thing or a bad thing I just I'm now aware of this but yeah it's there there's also just this energy in the US this energy in places like San Francisco which I then if I'm there a few weeks I do start to mimic it right I do start to there there's this like Tony Robin says proximity Is Power I think nothing beats it right if I spent more time with you in person I'd become more like you if you spent more time like me in person you'd become way cooler but really it just is that right I it's it's really hard to get away from this proximity thing uh totally separate topic but it's also why I I speak to a lot of entrepreneurs I'm in a lot of entrepreneur groups and one common problem people have is like things aren't working out for me BL and I often ask where do you live like as in do you live like near where stuff is happening oh no like during Co I moved out into the middle of nowhere and like I've got this amazing house but it's like 3 hours from anywhere and I'm like it's really hard to simulate the proximity thing like you do need to be near stuff physically the energy like I live in Berlin and I live in an area that's super busy and there's a lot going on and it feels it just there's a momentum there's something about and not to say that being in a nice peaceful still place isn't a beautiful thing to have it's just if that's your day today you will also become more chill you you you start to mimic that environment as well I mean where you look like you're in a pretty chill place right now but you you're often in Miami right yeah I mean the what you were describing being in the middle of nowhere is exactly where I am now I'm in like literally looking at it you know 95 Acres of mountains and there's no one around here I'm in the I'm in Canada and so I live I like to live my life you know from extremes you know Miami is like you're in it and here I'm like you're not in it and sometimes I I I'm I find it really helpful to dip in and out of the extremes yes so for you you're going to come to San Francisco you're G to get this like dose or injection of silic and Valley into your veins and but you know you're going to be taking your flight home and on your flight going to be wow should I raise venture capital and you're a guy who's never thought about raising venture capital in your life and that's because if you spend enough time in San Francisco you will think about raising around because that's what everyone does there for sure um so you know then then you're gonna go down to LA and you know on on your flight on your flight leaving La you're GNA be like oh you know I've been I've always been thinking I should really get into vlogging because everyone wants to be famous in LA so I think the hack is you have to write your goals like what are your goals personal career and then cities can help you get to your goals but too much of one city could also you know kind of hurt personal goals or hurt other career goals so I think that you should treat a city as just like um a utility in a way right like you you get something out of it um and but I want to say one quick thing which is I also don't think you should be one of those people that are constantly on a flight because if you don't have a home base you don't have like a community that's also just like a terrible way to live I was gonna I was going to push you on that one because I lo I'm I am really trying to build a community in my in my physical neighborhood here in Berlin uh like two nights ago I was hanging out at my neighbor's house just downstairs we're in a like a high-rise building I guess uh playing the new Elden ring DLC um I'm cooking dinner for Neighbors I I know the people working in the different shops here so I do love to be integrated into my community yeah this is interesting right a city is a utility and this is this is actually this is a totally different topic I guess we're just on topic two there's a lot of I I never I don't post about remote work versus in-person work and cities versus Urban environments anymore more because people go people who are like who've made the decision to like no cities forever get so angry about it like if you now for example had moved to wherever you are right now and had decided I am now a monk living in the middle of nowhere and I was like cities are a great place to get like this proximity and you'd be like oh no you can't say that for everyone but because you're flexible you can move between these two worlds it doesn't bother you and I think it the objective truth about this is first of all if you're all if you're already balling out of control unbelievably rich and your like your momentum is crazy and your network is insane sure move sell everything leave the city live in the middle of nowhere you don't need any more money and you don't need any more connections and let's say your purpose is gardening then you do not need to think about this ever again but if you're still on your journey I do think cities are they're not just a place to go have fun they are a utility that you pay for like there's a reason also people are like oh if you live in Berlin you pay this much for an apartment but if if you just move two hours outside you can get a house for that price and I'm like yes I'm not just paying for physical space I'm paying to be close to people who are doing things that I want to do I'm paying for this energy it's it is actually a service to live in the city I actually heard like someone was commenting someone was posting recently oh Munich is getting so expensive it's ridiculous whatever blah blah blah uh and this other German guy underneath wrote and and everyone was agreeing right and I was also like yeah sure like Germany is getting expensive everywhere is getting expensive and I was kind of in agreement I was like okay yeah everything's expensive [ __ ] this and then somebody rolled underneath it's not your human right to live in the center of a city like it's it's not a human right to live in the center of an expensive city obviously different story if you live there now you're getting kicked out because of gentrification but you as a you know me as an Irish guy who went to college I have absolutely no right to live in this Center of Berlin I don't by the way it's actually insanely expensive but I have no right to do that so I it's it is a utility it's a service and you're paying a premium because of the services and the amenities provided that's a whole whole separate thing but like for example I know if I wanted to live in San Francisco where the center of this AI explosion is right now if I was in Ai and I wanted to like basically increase my chances of a successful outcome I'd have to pay the price and live in a place like San Francisco I'm not looking for that but that is really the price of getting the rewards of living in a physical space that brings you closer to all the things you want and I think a lot of people need to change their mindset about that when they're saying I can get a seven story house out in the middle of nowhere it's like yeah you can and you just need to understand the tradeoff you can do that and that's really cool it's just about understanding these tradeoffs is important am I gone down a Bad Rabbit Hole no no this is great my take on my take on this is that every person has a ignorance tax that they have to pay down so no matter what your goals are there's a price that you have to pay to learn to get to your goals quicker and by living in San Francisco New York some of these places yes it's might be two times more expensive to live but you will just by as osmosis pay down your ignorance tax IGN ignorance debt way way way faster and the question for you is or or the person listening really is you know at this stage in your life and with the amount of money that you have saved up does is it worth spending an extra $1,500 a month or whatever it is for the premium to potentially get an extra client a month or learn about how VCS work or you know XYZ that's what it is it is absolutely that like a great a practical example of this is talking to someone today who is saying like talking about digital marketing and how do I do this and how am I how do I get calls and like it's really difficult to get calls and and then I was like I was trying to give advice but then I was like but the truth is how I started was I was in a co-working space in the center of Berlin which was full of startups and I physically talked to them and then I got work like I went drinking with them that like that's the truth and now I could move out into the middle of nowhere and build a career but but it is of course possible to build a career remotely and not in a city it's just the challenge it is kind of like playing on hard mode versus easy mode you get the the it's like in a video game you're putting the attributes into Comfort you're putting all your points into comfort and convenience but then the you have like low ability to get leads and build a career and I and I agree I I think all of these options are like people who want to live out in the middle of nowhere like you right now I think that is absolutely amazing as long as you understand the tradeoff and I think a lot of people are convinced by a lot of people who still haven't built their careers yet are convinced by some sort of part of the media to move out to the suburbs before they get any momentum and then there's like sometimes a little bit of resentment later in life like oh I could have I could have have done this I could have done that and it's like yeah you would have had to pay the city tax to get that to get those things or you have to become a [ __ ] amazing content creator which is hard to do or like a worldclass marketer which is also hard to do yeah I think you could move out to the suburbs or live off the grid if you build a big audience because then what what is an audience an audience is just puts you at the center of digital gravity yeah and then it's all good because you don't need to be in New York you don't need to be in San Francisco you know you're tweeting and you're getting a million views yes but so I you know if you're starting out or or you just want to accelerate your career I think you want to do both things you wanna you want to do the digital gravity thing and you want to build an audience uh and that's kind of your insurance and also it's your fallback plan for when you do you know you've been in New York and you hit 30 and you're like I'm tired of this I need out totally totally dude I I want that insurance too yeah who doesn't want that insurance I think it's but it's I know again yeah we've we've gone deeply into another topic but I I would love if some of my friends and entrepreneur friends had not jumped so aggressively on the covid everything is going to be remote Now train and now are like oh it's really weird weirdly hard to get work like yeah it is it is diff it is difficult when you when you are when you didn't get that momentum career momentum before you went away I think that's the challenge I think there has been this like it's back to your mimetic uh the wanting book I got to read this I think the mimetic desire thing works more powerfully in person it just has more of a powerful draw in person but also godamn it iners stuff's just easier to it's it's it feels like it's easier to start a career when you're in an environment where just other people are doing that too and and you just like for example when I moved to Berlin I just copied one of my friend's careers he was a ux designer we both studied digital media production and I was just like you you're doing what and like we would go out drinking and I would talk to him about it and then he'd show me his portfolio he tell me how much he got paid and like I'm just like I'm copying you dude Eric thank you so much for letting me copy everything you did I appreciate it dude um but yeah that that [ __ ] would be very challenging to do uh where I come from which is a small town in Ireland um because I don't know if there's a ux designer there you know what I mean a ux designer I don't know if there's one I don't know if there was one back when I was starting I went down we we we we rabid well that's what we do that's what we do we we burrow we burrow you know that's that's our style how do you split your time between this place you are right now and Miami I'm I'm in I'm in Miami call it seven to eight months a year eight months a year probably and then three three months summertime here and then maybe a month during the winter so that's the other thing I like about here is it's got the craziest seasons of all time it gets to like minus 45° and like snow is like 10 10t um and Miami is like you know the the complete opposite of that it's like hurricane season right now so I don't know I I I like I like again I like the diversity I like uh I find that I work I'm actually more productive up here uh it's a great place to write like think I'm in like a cabin in the woods basically right so it's like so good for writing so good for creativity um and uh that's also just helpful like if I have like 10 blog posts I want to write just fly up here spend a week here and fly back that's so cool and and you know here's the thing audience if I would spend more time with Greg then I would get more successful and be able to have two places where I live so I just need to spend more time in Greg's proximity absorbing his energy and then just those dollars come flying in that's how it's going to work I think I think we can end it here I got to ask people to like on YouTube If you enjoyed this apparently liking for the algorithm is a thing please like it please like it and uh and then subscribe and then leave us a review on on Spotify and apple if you're listening there yeah thank you so much everybody appreciate your time time and uh have a good one everyone later should we sip it out let's sip it [Music] out thanks everyone bye [Music]

There's an opportunity to build a social media insurance company I mean if you have an email list of 400,000 people like that's easily worth four plus million dollars that's a that's a mansion that's that's a mansion on on 20 acres you know so it's like of course you would spend a certain amount per year to make sure that if a Black Swan event happens or you do something wrong or you have an employee who goes off you know awall we will write you a check for X XYZ amount or will help you get back that account you're selling peace of mind yeah and if you can sell peace of mind you're going to be very wealthy I feel [Music] like Natalie Ellis the queen of startup ideas herself blessing us thank you for coming on I'm excited about this I love getting a chance to talk ideas like I always daydream about starting other businesses when I should not be starting any more businesses so this a perfect excuse exactly this is for me this is fast food like this podcast is fast food in the sense like I need I need to get this out there it's my it's my guilty pleasure I need to put these ideas out there and I know you have some ideas for us yeah I have loads tell me where you want me to start wherever you want to start you know what I've me thinking about about lately is um obviously just had a baby 2 years ago and have been in my own postpartum Health Journey which is before I had a baby I found it really easy to work out and be healthy and like do all the research and I had more time than I have now but since having a baby I've realized for me Wellness is very much it's mental health it's your physical health it's everything allinone and I've been been daydreaming about starting this company that's specific like I love a niche I feel like you I love a niche that's specifically for pregnant or postpartum women to come and just take every single box when it comes to health and make it so easy for them like I would love when I was pregnant for someone to just give me this all the list of like the mineral testing that I should be doing the gut testing the blood work and then have one person read the MRI like have one person read all the information and then give me a full plan based on that cuz I'm so used to going to different people for different things or I do feel like a lot of the companies out there that do this are very masculine and male focused and are like Fast coal plunge like all the things which is great but not necessarily what you want when you're in like that stage of your life so that's that's one idea that I have that I just wish someone would run with I feel like you could make it really high ticket like make it expensive put together these packages that you know you sell you sell to fewer people but you just give the best service and really take care of women and like take that one thing that's in their mind like completely off their plate so I feel like any Market where there's an overwhelming amount of information which is this and people willing to spend money which is this like you know if you're newly pregnant for example like you want to spend you know it's all about your baby um and so I think check checkbox I think it could be really interesting if you did either a text or email like it's basically a newsletter or or just like a text every week like every week we're going to send you a text and like here's what you need to know and and I you know and and just make it like re remove the noise you know what I mean yeah I could totally see that like they text and it's like here's the specific things you want to focus on this week and it's just done and you could maybe even text them back to get more specific advice like I'm having issues with this I'm having issues with my milk supply I'm like cuz there's so like I remember when I was postpartum there was so many supplements I couldn't take but then you can't just like call your doctor every single time can I take this can I take this so like having someone that you can just ask those questions to I feel like people would pay so much money to have that solved for them totally and then and then yeah I think once you there's a few ways where you can extend this business so one is is of course you can go like after postpartum partum you can you know as the child gets older you have new needs so you can like extend it that way eventually you can you know as soon as someone gets pregnant download this app or or whatever so you can you could you could extend it I like that um how would you actually grow something like this so let's just say you wanted to build something like this how do you you know I you're you know you've built Instagram audiences with 3 four 5 million followers you know probably hundreds of millions of views at this point uh You' Pro you've you've done eight figures in revenue from those audiences like would you do an audience first approach with this I think if I was to do this what I would do is put together like a very detailed package and a very detailed person and I would just do direct reach out like actually email the person something like very compelling direct response like here's exactly what I'm going to to do for you and just directly reach out to people get them on calls and sell them in I would probably also do it for free to a bunch of influencers who have audiences of the women I'm going after like looking for influencers who have audience of women who are pregnant or newly postpartum and actually are looking to pay for a service like this but when I started see your mama which is a mastermind for seven to nth figure um Mom entrepreneurs this this was my Approach I literally wrote down in my notes app all of the women that would be a dream to have in and I just reach out to them one by one and it was so easy like they were like this solves my problem I sent like a 7 minute loom video they were like this solves all my problems sign me up so I feel like I'd probably just do more of a sales approach than an audience approach with this one and really get that product Market fit because I feel like people are going to come back and say well Does it include this Does it include this I'm looking for this and you can like tailor what you're offering but I feel like you could get to Seven figures so fast just doing that with no audience at all and then if you wanted to build an audience you totally could but I feel like I probably wouldn't would you hey everyone if you're anything like me you've got a ton of design work that you need websites landing pages emails social assets you name it but you don't just want beautiful landing pages or beautiful websites you want the stuff that's going to convert you want the stuff that's going to actually drive value that's where design scientist.com comes in it's an agency that for one monthly price will do all your design work all your copy work all your engineering and do stuff that actually scales your Revenue you don't need a designer you need a design scientist let's go design scientist.com I liked it so much I invested in the business I mean I always start with build building an audience just so I can even if I don't use the audience just so I could understand the audience better and understand the positioning and ab test the offer so I would I would concurrently build the audience even if I don't really use it my qu I have a question for you on like that loom video strategy that worked for you because I mean if if I'm getting a DM from Natalie Ellis like I'm opening that um but how important was the fact that people trust you or you know do you need a creater type co-founder with something like this I don't think you need it I will say it's definitely been an advantage for me but I received this email from someone about a month ago and she is a stylist and she sent me this email and I've never heard of her before and she was like hi I'm getting back into business after taking the last decade off to have babies I was a stylist I'm getting back into it just open very honestly so like I went ahead and pulled 10 looks for you that I think you'd absolutely love I've linked all the looks in the PDF you don't even have to reply to this if you don't want just go ahead and buy the outfits if you love it if you do like it and you'd want to work in a more formal way let me know so I opened this it was like this PDF made in canva and it was um 10 looks pulled for Natalie Ellis here's Natalie's style summed up and then it was 10 outfits on 10 different pages with all the links and I went through I absolutely loved it and I got back to and I was like okay I want to work more formally with you and I've just spent I think I think I've spent maybe $2,500 with her to have her pull all my looks virtually I never heard of her before but I feel like she reached out with such a personalized approach she doesn't have an audience or anything like that but she just puts so much time and effort into it it like really caught my attention so I could see if you didn't have the social capital doing something like that could actually really work totally yeah I think you don't really need the social capital it obviously helps you just have to your offer needs to be dialed you know your offer needs to be super dialed and and you have to build the trust another way so uh I just hired someone who came personalized approach like you said Loom which by the way is the best for you know a two-minute Loom and it was just like hey I'm 23 years old I've done XYZ things I think that I can help you in you know this category in this C it was it was like growth and um just made it really easy for me and I was like okay it was $7,500 and I was like okay this is a random DM but like here's my credit card yeah when someone reaches out and they directly solve your problem in the most convenient way it's you're like yes please I'll totally sign up and I feel like you I feel like you could do that with this idea or similar spaces if you don't have the audience and you are like okay I my Revenue goal is this I would just do more of that but it's like I also feel like and this might upset people but I feel like sometimes people are not willing to go the extra mile and they like just put out the most basic [ __ ] and expect it to work like I'm hiring right now and some of the applications I get in I'm like on what planet do you feel like this is a good application oh I get some people reaching out selling me stuff my DMs and it's such a generic copy paste I just think if you just went the extra mile there's so few people willing to do that you're going to stand out and I think that's the approach you need to have especially in the start phase of a business like how can I go the extra mile to really dial in my offer make it completely irresistible maybe do some of the things that unscalable but it's going to attract the right people to me it's going to give me feedback on my product and and then you can scale that way but I don't feel like a lot of people are willing to go the extra mile or I don't see it I mean they're not and and On hiring like I I actually review every single person that applies to lay checkout and I'd say 20% of people that apply to lay checkout the there's like a reason field it's like why do you want to join and they say to learn the number one reason why they're applying for this job is to learn from lay checkout or learn from Greg Eisenberg it's like that's not why oh I'm going to go pay you $80,000 a year or $100,000 a year to just like come and learn what we're doing and then so you can just you know in in six months or nine months just go and start your own version like no that's not the right offer you know the positioning should be you know you've got this business I think I'm uniquely able to help here's a couple ideas for you and you know hiring when you're when you apply for a job it's the same thing as as you're selling yourself ultimately right so and sometimes we'll have people complete um test projects and I've even had like I have them complete the test project and put it into the application have some responses saying I don't work for free like well you're not working at all bye-bye mic drop that's so good oh my goodness it drives me insane but yeah it's like taking that approach like I feel like every successful entrepreneur that you speak to has and probably is still willing to just fully roll their sleeves up and and do the things most people aren't willing to do and you know spend the time on a proposal that might not even get a response but know that the work you're putting out you're really proud of and you can see where this is going and I think you have to be willing to do that with any idea and then you can pivot you'll get great data but yeah I I I don't think it's hard to go the extra mile I don't think it's hard to like do something incredible because most people won't do it yeah totally and I think two minute looms oh my God just do a twoin loom and get your background right get a get a microphone spend $50 or something on a microphone so you sound good be excited and write a script yeah don't just like talk you know just oh let me yeah I'm just going to talk no no no write a script write a script do you ever think about that if you all are starting from scratch right now like yes people can say you know the job market saturated or the entrepreneurship space is saturated this industry is saturated whenever I'm looking at starting again from scratch I actually feel like I'm so well positioned to start again because I'm just willing to do those things I'm willing to think about does my background look decent you know am I willing to prep for this call I'm just willing to do those things and I feel like if you go into this into anything applying for jobs startup ideas anything with just this attitude of expectation you're just not going to get there and I know that's like harsh to say but I I also don't think this like jenzy movement the quiet quitting all that stuff I don't think that's really setting people up for Success at all I have strong opinions on all of that a friend of mine a friend of mine text me this morning he was like how's your experience with the Twitter algorithm recently been and I WOTE most tweets get way less Impressions but sometimes you go ballistic he writes my engagement has been trash and he works with a Ghostwriter he writes my content guy who's genen Z literally quit because he couldn't deal with the low engagement [Laughter] ha if that doesn't sum up this conversation I don't know what is like that's who you're competing against like you you on in the hiring Market you're competing against that the job market you're competing against that and then and then go you know in the startup ideas in startup space that's who you're competing again so I think that going back to to your idea it's like you just have to be a little more polished you just have to uh do a little more and people will appreciate it and that's why cold dming does still work yeah it it really does still work it's not S I don't feel like and you know I'm still a big advocate of building audience on social I don't think it's too saturated I just think it's the way that you approach it if you're going to approach it trying to do the same thing that everyone else is doing and have this low effort approach I don't think you're going to get the results that you're looking for so yeah across the board um what are some of your startup ideas lately like oh let me consult my my list all right I'm going to put my list okay here one for you okay I A friend of mine called me the other week and he goes dude you're not going to believe it my Twitter account got suspended this is a person with 500 plus thousand followers and why did it get suspended he was he was basically in an engagement pod so he would tweet out something he'd post it to this group chat they would all come in reply sometimes retweet him and it's actually against Twitter Twitter's terms of service to to do that his account got banned he was in tears guy literally in tears and it got me thinking that um there's an opportunity to build a social media insurance company okay so pay us $1,000 a year and in the case that you know your account gets taken away we will write you a check for X XYZ amount or we'll help you get back that account it's basically just I you know I would pay for that you know and I'm not I'm I don't do engagement pods or stuff like that but I would just pay a fee to make sure that uh I don't lose my account from some Black Swan event this exists I just got pitched on this are you kidding me yeah I just got a company reach out to me pitching me that's all they do is social media Insurance on your account and they'll pay you oh let me find it there's actually when I looked into it um even the company that we currently work with for business insurance now offers this it's wild let me find see if I can find it in my inbox like it blew my mind that this was a thing get dn.com SL Instagram but it's insurance for digital assets so it says this is for influencers and Shop owners to coaches and artists insurance for digital assets is essential for anyone who relies on web for their uh content and their income so they will literally ensure your Instagram your YouTube twitch Tik Tok nfts soon to be Twitter yeah it's genius so this is brilliant this is brilliant the way to do this so I still think there's an opportunity Notch is going very horizontal so they're they're basically saying like we're you know they're trying to be the Geico of digital assets I think the way to do this is I would create a bunch of sub Brands so it would be like twitch Insurance X Insurance YouTube insurance and then and then you know it's just a bit more Niche and and I think that you know if I got reached out by someone who just focuses on Twitter X insurance and that was where the my bread and butter was I would trust them maybe a little bit more than something like Notch that's really smart like you feel like they would just fully focus in on that totally also also like you know I see it says Twitter Insurance coming soon I don't want to be the first person that they're going to Ure I had a you know there's a 401k company I won't name them but two years ago they launched and I have my 4 K with some like boring Bank Fidelity or something like that and uh they they hit me up great pitch great pitch great Loom with it and you know cold DM and I was like I love this and once I went and looked at moving my 401k they're like oh you're going to be the the first person to to actually move your 401k and I was like respectfully dude I'm out I'm out yeah no one want that no one wants that yeah okay good call I like that I like that idea of having sub Brands actually and just like feeling even if it's the same company but feeling like they they know exactly what they're doing they understand it inside out cu you're right as well most people do go heavy on one platform specifically yes so that makes total sense I also feel like I wonder if people would ever Ure email lists cuz that's also such a panic for people what would happen if yeah if I ever lost my email list oh my God like do they would they Ure email lists I had how big is your email list I mean it changes all the time it's around 400,000 now but I had a situation last year last October I had this C DM I mean we're talking how they can be good this one went kind of South so and it was a cold email and they were talking they were on my email list and they feel like we could boost our open rates our open rates were about 32% could boost our open rate R click through rates and I dug into this company and I actually knew the founder not super close but knew the founder had mutual friends and I thought yeah let's give this a shot anyway they came in and what they actually did in our account got us blacklisted with Google so our email open rates went from 32% to pretty much nothing like we were getting barely anyone opening the email list and overnight I was worried my entire business had just like went to [ __ ] and we had to go through a whole process of run Ting it and that was a whole thing but in that moment I to have insurance on your email list would have been golden and also having someone like having an insurance company like that you could reach out to and say okay I've lost my entire email list has been blacklisted what am I going to do like they would probably have steps to recover I felt like there was nobody could help me I was getting different advice from everyone and most people are like you know this is just a process I eventually did figure out how to do it but it was a nightmare and I would pay for insurance to have someone to like call in an emergency situation to just resurrect things 100% I mean if you have an email list of 400,000 people like that's easily worth four plus million dollars so that's a that's a mansion that's that's a mansion on on 20 acres you know so it's like of course you would spend a certain amount per year to make sure that uh if a Black Swan event happens or you do something wrong or you have an employee who goes off you know awall there's someone you can call and and I think I think this is a really big business idea and the way I would do it is I would again focus on these different niches so let's just say newsletter I'd even start even more granular I'd be like I'm only doing beehive newsletters so I would be like the Beehive newsletter Insurance person and or and Company and what I would do is I I would prove out the model and then Al partner with beehive right so once you partner with beehive they can just upsell it you split the revenue they're happy because you know they're making more money you're happy because you now have distribution through them and eventually I see you can easily sell one of these businesses to beehive because they're gonna want that internally that is a genius idea wait how do you do this podcast and not go start new businesses how do you well the beauty is my my job is to start new businesses and buy businesses okay so like I might start this business honestly I might text Ty you know DM Tyler after this from beehive and be like let's do this thing can I be involved yes yes I mean that's why that's why I do this you know that's why I do this that is actually a genius idea though because I would have absolutely un beehive by the way were the only people that helped me resurrect my list of anyone really yeah so it was costing me um I was spending 50,000 a year on a different platform and when this happened I couldn't get in touch with anybody and I've been with them I've had a big email list for a really really long time like eight years maybe and way before it was cool and I was couldn't get in contact with them they kept sending me to live chat people kept saying they couldn't help me I was asking for a phone number no one would help me and I reached out to behive I was like please can somebody help me like have this list I I don't know what to do they got on a call with me right away and we're like okay let's talk this through and it was the most help that I've had and we switched to them we went from spending that much money to spending 10K a year or something like that and it's been the best experience ever and just instantly they this helped me like it actually felt like someone cared enough to like help me solve the problem but that blows my mind when you can be a client for so long and spend so much money with someone and you can't even get them on the phone like that's the easiest way to lose business and and that company keeps losing more and more business to platforms like beehive totally totally yeah I mean I think uh what they did for you is almost like something they should have charged for um but they don't they just give it away for free and I think that's why this insurance idea for beehive makes so much sense because they'll be able to upsell that and that's the reason uh Shopify has I think three plans I think it's Shopify the regular one which is like 30 bucks a month and they've got a mid tier and then they've got Shopify plus which is basically their Enterprise plan and a big reason why you're on their Enterprise plan which I think is $2,500 a month is you have someone to talk to you have someone you have a shoulder to cry on and that's worth a lot it's worth so much when your whole business is wrapped up in your email list which most businesses should versus social you have to have someone that can support you we need to do this idea that and I also discovered something during this process of how to resurrect your email which I don't really want to share right now but if anyone's like in the is in the situation they can message me but I learned a lot and I feel like an insurance company could totally charge for that information because it's very Niche information like you Google it and you're not going to learn how to get off a Google Blacklist unless you're like sending you know to a very small segment of your list over and over and over again the company that we initially worked with charged us 20K for Consulting they couldn't solve the problem they were like yeah it's probably going to be 3 months and we'll just start by sending emails to a couple thousand and I was like this doesn't work for me I can't have my whole business stopped for three months so yeah like what planet do you live on yeah like that that's not going to work for me I need a solution like tomorrow I need to and I had Partners like I had to cancel Partnerships like sponsors cuz I wasn't going to put it out and then have no one open it so so it's like it impacts so much of your business like let's say you have so we have sponsors locked in for 12 months at a time you should be able to give that in info to your insurance company and like let's say you have to close that sponsorship down you'd still get paid out what you would have from your sponsor like it's worth its weight and gold and I feel like a lot of people on beehive would want to do that because they are locking in those longer term sponsorships now they're monetizing like crazy 100% so I think the one take I have for people is if you're coming up with startup ideas this category this trend is businesses for people they're should they're shoulder to cry on businesses yeah you can you can just brainstorm a 100 ideas just on on this and I think it could be beehive it could be a bunch of different categories but those are some of the best business to be in and that's why Warren Buffett Berk sure Hathaway you know their biggest businesses are Insurance businesses Geo Etc because they understand you know what is an insurance business an insurance business is there's a certain amount of risk that a bad thing's going to happen but you're an expert you understand what that risk is so for example uh I was just watching the an uh annual meeting for Brookshire hathway and they had this guy named ajet who runs all their insurance businesses and he was saying how there was like a year or two where Berkshire hathway did not Ensure any any homes in Florida because they based on their research they're like there's going to be a hurricane uh and they're going to lose a lot of money and then but now for whatever reason they have data that's saying we are going to insure in Florida so as risks changes they decide you know what to underwrite and and how to how to think about this but insurance is an incredible business why because you're selling something let's say for $5,000 a year and it's literally a piece of paper that says if this bad thing ha bad things this bad thing happens I will give you money or something but it's you're you're getting all the funding in the beginning right yeah um so it's a beautiful business model if you understand how to underwrite for risk that's so smart I even think too about like should at cryon businesses like when your ads account gets shuts down and your whole business relies on ads like there's so many these little spaces where business owners need shoulders to cry on I love it uh we have time for one one more idea I could either give you an idea that you can give feedback on or you can give me an idea it's up to you yeah give me an idea cool let me pull it up so I saw this tweet by this guy at Canada Caz someone needs to build an AI agent that is good at financial analysis they will make an obscene amount of money and make the world a better place by freeing thousands of hours a day that some of our smartest people spend typing numbers from annual reports into Excel sheets and then people responded there's this guy named Sheil manote who writes I get at least one pitch a week on this topic but I haven't seen anything compelling yet I think this idea around a financial advisor agent is kind of the dream I'm curious what do you think of something like that because when you think of a financial advisor for example they act like an agent they act like AI right they're like okay what's your risk tolerance what are your goals and then they have like you know a model based on based on that we're going to buy companies like this and it just feels like something that the best possible financial adviser to me is probably an AI agent because they'll just have access to way more data and they'll act with less uh you know humans act when fearful when they're fearful when the market goes down they often sell uh when when they're when the market goes up they end up being greedy so I'm curious what do you think about this idea around building AI agents for you know the financial world yeah I could totally see that I feel like too it would be really great to have someone that you can come to or like AI that you can come to and say give me just lay out all my options cuz I sometimes feel like with financial advise that you kind of the quality of the advice you get is the quality of the questions that that you ask but I often don't know the kind of questions that I want to ask and so I could see someone an AI coming and like laying out all your different options and playing out all the different scenarios for you and you deciding which one you go you you want to go into because if you're someone like me who doesn't know I just fully trust my financial advisor I don't really know the kind of questions to ask I'm like uh take care of my money and help me make more but I don't really I would love to have that more laid out for me but I also could see that working generally in the business space like I'm not from America so having a company here I find really confusing like setting up your company and then the different reports you've got to file every year and then all the tax returns and all the all the so many things it would be so great to have an AI that just is on top of all of this stuff and comes to you and says okay we need to file this report now we need to do like there's so many different things like that for every different country as well and if you're running a company in multiple countries be so good to have an AI that just scourers like all of the different laws and different things you need to do and brings it to you okay I have an here's the idea I I've got it okay it's called have you thought of this.com that's good okay and what it what did is it doesn't replace your financial adviser it doesn't replace your lawyer it doesn't replace your you know business advisor but it acts as a third party that's unbiased that sends you a weekly email or text that says have you thought about these three things so for example in the financial advisor thing it's like have you thought about you know buying uh Berkshire hathway this week because the stock price went down 10% but their earnings went up 5% in the last quarter and then you can take that information that's distilled and actually this goes back to what we were talking about earlier where there's so much information people just want curation that you can go to your finan adviser and be like hey have you thought of bksh your hathway and then you can have that conversation with your adviser I like this a lot cuz there so and even when we're talking about like the social media Insurance piece just having this AI that just sends you these things have you thought about insuring XYZ have you thought about like there's so many things that you have to think about when you are a business owner or you own property or you have money that you want to invest there's so many things to just have it distilled like that I think would be genius like it's almost just like a family office AI yeah explain you know talk more about that okay so I just feel like family offices are great if you hit a if you hit a certain wealth threshold but there's a lot of people that maybe don't meet the threshold that actually still need a lot of the support like have businesses have property have some money that they want to invest um just have a lot of moving Parts in their life and it would be so great to have one agent one AI one person thing robot responsible for just keeping everything in check have you paid your property tax have you um maxed out your 41k have you submitted your Workforce report have you like all of those different things and like maybe you come to the AI and there's like a a detailed questionnaire and you fill it out with all of your different things that you have going on life and then everything just gets like every month maybe January the stuff to do February the stuff to do and you can input all and and I could honestly see it going like I'm a granular person I could see it being like a whole Manual of being able to run your life and business for you with all the details like even as detailed as like here's if you own three properties here's how often you have to change the air conditioning unit here's how often you need to do XYZ like the mental Lord of having stuff or running things is so high if you could have ai take that mental load I think people would be willing to really pay for that how much do you think people would pay for something like that I don't know I think it's probably a sliding scale based on the net worth of their businesses and property like you know I I as we start owning more and more property I just realize the mental load gets bigger and bigger so I'd probably pay more and more per month to to manage more things so I could like you know when you sign up for a newsletter when you like Slide the scale to say how many subscribers you have and it gives you a price almost you could slide the scale to say like here's what my property and businesses is all worth and then it gives you a monthly fee totally yeah and for you you're like it's piece of mine you're selling piece of mind yeah and if you can sell peace of mind you're going to be very wealthy I feel like totally and that's another Trend right another way to think about business ideas is you know how do you how do you sell peace of mind to different niches because that's thing like shoulders to cry on people will pay for peace of mind yeah and and convenience and yeah I think the mental load just continues to get bigger and bigger every year and if you could just take that mental load off and give it to an AI and and and you probably get a report every week and then things that you need to do and it's just like you know okay I'm not getting sent to jail cuz I forgot to do my tax return or my house isn't going to like burn down and I'm not sure like there's n you you're able to mitigate those risks you can sleep easier at night totally and I think from a you know how I'd grow this perspective I think there's so many stories like sad bad stories that you know someone forgot to I don't know file their tax return and they have all this interest or you know someone you know some bad thing happen and you can just sell fear basically so you create uh Instagram Twitter what whatever Tik Tok and you're just going to be let me tell you the story of how XYZ went from a $10 million net worth to you know inbt a million dollars and you tell these stories and then it's like buy our product follow us for more of these stories oh yeah I think yeah that's what you do have you heard of Johanna no tell me about it Johanna it's why o h a n a and it's the personal assistant app for parents so it's this app they call it the ultimate parenting hack and basically the goal of Y Hanna is to take the mental load of parenting off of you so like some of the things that they do is plan date nights hire handyman plan birthday parties book appointments weekly meal planning um order costumes maintain the car cleaning service babysitters like the mental Lord of parenting basically they handle and they use Ai and then they also have real people which I I feel like they'll probably switched AI fully AI in the near future um I think it's kind of like this it's your Hana but for like family office or like the the different areas of your life but basically they're selling peace of mind for parents because as a parent there's like always so much [ __ ] to do there's like always a holiday coming up there's always a birthday coming up there's always you know your normal life to-do list and then your parenting to-do list and they just take that whole thing away and I think that is a big Trend and people are willing to pay for it and they've been able to make it really affordable too yeah it's really affordable it's $129 a month like I expected it to be way more yeah my guess is so they this is started by this is like a a crack team so they this was started by um Johanna I guess is her name no Yoki oh um and she she co-founded Google X so she developed Nest like The Nest Thermostat so she's smart she knows what she's doing she knows what she's doing my guess is they've raised tons of money I'm going to check real quick it's really smart to just release people's mental load and in specific niches you could I could see this oh yeah tell me what you finding so first of all they launched with a $249 membership so they've actually cut it in half and I wonder if it's the AI That's just making it a little more efficient um I personally wouldn't want I think this is a great business uh I don't know how much they've raised uh but I'm guessing tens of millions I personally wouldn't want to compete with them because they've got an app that they've built and it just seems like they're subsidized you know they're probably not making much money on that 129 um but yeah what can you unbundle from from this uh to to compete with them that's that's a question I don't know I don't know the answer to that but that's that's interesting and it's cool this is I'm happy you brought this up because I I do think that yeah this is a peace of mind play and like even when you go to their about page it's literally like it's literally like a person with like their brain and doves coming out of their brain my God that's you I feel like it could be like a johana for entrepreneurs johana for property like right there's so many different Vehicles you could go into with this and it's the same business model but you're I I if I was going to do this and use AI I would probably go for more of like a higher priced service like a very white glove but I feel like the way y Han's doing it it's just very affordable and approachable which is also amazing for parents totally cool all right this was fun wait I I don't know that I could do this as often as you do I want to go and start so many new businesses right now you're like you're ready to just run through a wall right now you're like oh my God you're like did we just start four businesses I I feel like I don't have the willpower to talk about ideas this often you know Different Strokes for different folks do you ever get people listening to the show and then writing in saying oh my God took this idea ended up starting it here's where I'm at dozens of people have taken ideas uh over the last couple months and built them some are creating you know generating revenue and it's really really cool quitting their jobs and everything but the vast majority of people listen and they're just like listening to they they they're just they find it fun to to get their creative juices flowing and uh it also might spark something in their own life you know it might be like well I never heard about Yanna I'm gonna go and use that that makes sense I love it so fun Natalie where could people uh learn more about you and and get to know you better the best place is my podcast you can just search for the boss way podcast we release twice a week cool yeah check it out I listen episodes and it's uh you're good you're good at what you do so I highly recommend it thank you later [Music]

question one of them being when do you feel the happiest with your partner and they all told me the same thing when we do a shared activity so I thought why not try to help couples to come up with dat ideas especially if they've been for together for a while and how I got inspired by something that people already do um it's kind of a physical jar you could have with like date ideas you put in the jar but I want to make it more efficient and also uh simpler for couples so the idea would be that you create an account in an app would give you some suggestions on things uh to see in your city or events or uh things to cook at home movies to watch ET you pick the one virtual uh idea jar is ready and whenever you need it you can say hey today training what should we be doing we have two hours and then an idea to pop up for example um and how would you charge for it idea yeah I was thinking to charge um more the the businesses that we would promote whether it's rest events or or things that we would get some traction on yeah so [Music] this is one of those ideas where I like the idea and I see the need but it's a hard business to be in because the local businesses the restaurants I mean restaurants are struggling right now local businesses are struggling right now they're not excited to take out their credit card and pay for you know ads and recommendations really at this point so if I were you and I was like I want to make relationship sh more healthy and I think that's a whole like I would pivot this idea to be less of like a consumer app less of like hey come to this place you're going to get ideas and more about hey your relationship could be better and we're you know we're scientific dating.com and what we do is we help couples scientifically uh have healthier relationships and it's you have to pay for it for it it's a monthly fee or a yearly fee um and you get a concierge maybe and the concierge gives you ideas in your local town and maybe it's assisted by by AI um but I think there's a a big business to be created around concierge healthy dating um recommendations um we think of things that you might forget like you know we help you send gifts during uh you know it's it's a national Quant day and your girlfriend likes Quant and you send like a box of Quant or something like that so I think that's the play here that's the only thing I do that's the only way I would sip this idea otherwise it's it's a big spit for me but I I do think that there's a bunch of people who'd spend money to have healthier relationships um and then I think the other thing to think about is who are you targeting are you targeting males are you targeting females are you targeting couples because the positioning needs to be extremely clear um about who you're targeting first so that's that's my feedback on your idea can I just say one thing or yes you can um I actually launched already a first feature it's called coupl vision. CH it's kind of MVP and it's a assessment you can take with your partner to define a vision for your relationship and I took the concept from a book it's exercise that already exists but normally you would do it on paper you're breaking up unfortun but is it is it couple Vision coupl vision. caion yeah um because I don't it's not coming up for me couple Vision could someone put it in the chat does anyone see it coming up because it doesn't come up for me couple couples or couple Vision I can coup vision. CH https CH got it yeah it's Switz cool all right I'm gonna share this real quick um and then we we'll move on to the next person but okay how do you picture your future craft a vision for your lifestyle okay this is really smart you choose statements that outline your personal vision for an ideal relationship together review and rate the importance of each statement unified yeah this is this is something this is one of those things where here's what I would do if I were you I would create a quiz a free quiz where it's like rate our relationship on right and it spits out a score and you you know you ask both Partners to fill it out and it spits out a score and that score you can share on Instagram like you autocreate Instagram stories out of it um where people easily could could share it once you do that then you build your top of the funnel because you're you know that's why you had tons of back in the day Facebook apps there was all these quizzes that got hundreds of millions of users because they were they were doing these quizzes quizzes is a tried tested way to social quizzes is a tried tested proven way to generate top of the funnel once you have that top of the funnel the product that you built which I think is really smart couple coupl vision. CH that actually could be paid and you can charge for that you you can charge for that and then I think what you end up doing is you I still think you you you build like your whole you build concierge and you build premium and you build taste and you build curation around like you charge some I I think I don't know about a month but maybe a lifetime uh sorry a yearly fee couple hundred bucks a year and I think uh that's a really good idea so thank you for coming up um and uh we'll uh we'll keep following nothing worse than than than tough Wi-Fi but she had a good idea it just needed to be just needed to be a little massaged so uh it's it is interesting when you know there's there's certain ideas that the core of it is right but you you just need to massage it and it's just missing that huge top of the funnel growth or thinking about it from a funnel perspective there's so many entrepreneurs that are just not thinking about creating businesses from a funnel perspective so um it's always interesting always interesting to hear all right next we're going to bring up Courtney and uh hopefully her Wi-Fi is better hi courney oh my God you're coming in like perfect perfect summer glow summer glow you're ready to go I love it um what's on your mind so I have been a pediatric and adult sleep coach for about 10 years and in the space of the work I do um it's postpartum education I'm a lactation counselor sleep coach and Doula right so um predominantly kids mostly babies um there's a gap in the market right so there's courses and ebooks that are pretty popular taking care of babies is probably one of the most popular and um it's a course in video right but it's a couple hundred bucks on the other side of the spectrum I charge you know for private coaching which is what our main business was you know depending on if it's my team or myself couple hundred dollars to a couple thousand dollars depending on what people want so it's cost prohibitive well there was a blue ocean opportunity in the middle to um kind of take what what was this side of it and then this side of it and do something in the middle that included the coaching because that's what the parents really need is like every baby's unique and different but if they don't ever get to talk to someone they off often you know can find struggle in helping their children sleep so I built something called Sleep steps it's the first all-inclusive membership program that's affordable because I want every parent to have access to Quality education so it's $47 a month there's a native app for Android and iOS it is an all-inclusive program there's live weekly hold on Corney I need to pull this up what's the URL um tiny transitions.com sleeps okay I'm gonna I'm gonna pull it up yeah we're gonna pull it up this is a this is a this is a crowd that likes a visual this is a crowd that likes a visual all right walk me through what I'm looking at here okay so it is essentially the course and the written part right the video education which is what parents need foundationally right in our private coaching we do it on Zoom I've basically broke it into modules right inside of kajabi okay on the other side people want the written program to follow which they get but they don't get the coaching with these courses that are out there today they don't get access to someone like me without paying a couple hundred dollars and I didn't I don't love that right like there is a way to make this accessible where people can get the individualized coaching but in a group capacity which is what I've tried to do so when you join you get newborn infant and toddler so you can kind of pick where you are then you get the coaching Community inside kajabi so if you have questions myself and my team are you know managing those then you get the live weekly calls where you can come in and say you know hey I've had a rough week this might be happening with feeding or puking or you know digestive issues or sleep issues or nap issues or going to vacation in Bal and how do I handle the time change right the coaching is the unique part of the fact that nobody's added that aspect into the program and what I want to do is make it all encompassing right so it's like the idea which is taking care of babies right she's sold millions of courses but there's a gap there's no coaching and if you want that it's a couple hundred bucks on the other side to work with me in private coaching starts at a thousand bucks for three weeks right cost prohibitive for many families so I was effectively able to create a new type of offering where I'm struggling is people understanding the fact that it is so awesome at this price point because I'm trying to do it as a membership where you come for the sleep and then you stay for the community because you're gonna have SLE regressions you're gonna have uh transitions you're gonna have vacation you might introduce another kid into the mix right so I I wanted it to be something where they got quality education coaching and the community at a price point that's appropriate and at the same time they want to stick around right like the membership side of it and I I've kind of gone back and forth in my mind of do I keep it at $47 know that it's a gang busters idea and just have to work on maybe the reach a little bit better or do I turn it into something that's low ticket high volume or high value and volume right seven bucks you get all this a month recurring oh but if you need private coaching you can then upsell to work with one of the members of my team or myself in the private capacity and my mission is truly to provide all of this at a price point that's appropriate because the Sleep education can be bucketed into age right but every baby is different so you need an aspect of either the live zooms or the community to allow people to get feedback right because every baby's different I just finished with newborn that's four weeks old 10 minutes ago and we were talking about building you know the right intake in the day and then you know a different baby I just started with two days ago has severe gird and just is a mess you know what I mean but like you can't a that what's the size of the of the community right now like how many people are in it oh only about 150 because we just launched it and I I'm just trying to figure out like where my messaging is off that people don't see how valuable it is for what it is because I think they're so used to what is in the market and this doesn't exist in the market so I'm sort of you know people know taking care of babies she sold millions of ebooks and courses but there's no coaching right and then there's a lot of Sleep Consultants on the other side of the Spectrum in a very unregulated space which is a different story but you know you get this flood of people offering High ticket coaching not everybody can afford that or frankly not everybody needs that so it's a totally new space but I'm just launched we just got the apps live so it's like okay now I'm ready to hit go and the way I have it in my mind is that I'm gonna do um an ad to our audience we've got a pretty decent Siz like audience and then do the ad to like a free 45 minute training that teaches foundations and then upsell to sleep steps right so it's a really great thorough training have a quiz that's a schedule generator I have a quiz that's like why won't my baby sleep through the night all these things feed them into the nurture nurture funnel but we're just starting to watch the conversion metrics of you know are people converting to sleep steps are they converting to private coaching are they just booking a call um you know I'm just trugg I know the value is amazing for what you're getting but I just can't seem which is equally frustrating because I'm usually really good at this stuff how to help people see that the value and what you get is so worth that $47 right and you for a month or you can cancel it and is that problem let me let me first of all I want to say this is like this is going to be huge and it's one of those things where you have to just stick with it a little bit and iterate on the funnel but this will work um I'll just give you my quick gut reaction to your your messaging landing page and then let's just Jam for a couple minutes so to me okay there's a few things that I would change on your website one is there's too many places to click like how many calls to actions one 2 3 four five 6 seven eight nine calls to action so we need to remove that to one call to action so what what you should do here is you know if you're creating if this is your landing page last sleep steps it should you should remove remove all these um the second thing is how do you think about what is the outcome here right the outcome is the outcome isn't necessarily sleep training or get helps with naps or get helps with bedtime or start today it's definitely not start today the first two words start today is about you and it's not about you the POS the positioning always needs to be about them so I think what it is is something like get your kid you know get your get your zero to foury old child to sleep you know or or make them become legendary sleepers um something like that which is shorter a bit more catchy and this to me is you know you could include this but it's almost it's almost like you're kind of saying it over here and this should just all all be about the outcome not necessarily the method okay um then you have you know you're the thing here is the $47 just to me feels like random right so there's a couple ways that you can make people feel like they're getting value one is what is the worth like it doesn't say anywhere how much this is actually worth and you know people spend you know people spend thousands of dollars a year for four years to get the value that you're creating over here but you need to you need to write out what all the different value is like for example I think we have I think we do this on one of our memberships um so this is a a membership we run called Community Empire it's for people who want to you know Founders who basically want to build uh ACP audience Community product businesses without any investor capital and I think you can honestly just copy something like this okay um like use this as the structure so it's like very simple oneliner like here's the outcome people want to build their internet Empire but and here's the method on how then it's it it doesn't necessarily need to be weightless only um but in this example it is and then here it's like unlock the training the community the workshops and $50,000 in deals so it's like then you look at how much it costs it's $149 a month $50,000 just in deals makes it worth it and you get a free school account worth $99 a month and you know all these things right so it's about anchoring there then I think you're missing this which is which is a Manifesto you need to write down exactly like a you know a a a a a a letter basically that gets people excited about your point of view you should you know you talk about you know the difference between good sleep and bad sleep and how it affects kids you know children's development and why you do what you do and just talk about you know every I think every website today in 2024 needs to have a Manifesto you know what's missing from this also this website which you should also have is um video like where's the there should be a video right over here if you scroll down a little bit to the bottom I just was messing with this yesterday the video top of the page and I was like maybe people don't like like the video but yeah no people want the video like you know and there's there's there's apps now that you can install that like it'll pop up on the side over here but think about it people are spending 90% of their time on YouTube and Instagram and Tik Tok consuming video yet our websites in 2024 are text in photos so I think that especially you're so engaging and you're so well spoken and you're so passionate that I think having a video here would do really well okay um and then just make it really SC like you honestly less is more with these membership websites like just make it so scrollable like very simple to to you know to to to sort of scan make it really scannable um very visual um build your you know I think one thing that uh you can also do here is you have to scroll down to see your credibility Newsweek Yahoo Google all this stuff I don't want to like that's you know show your credibility up top okay because you are credible um can you still hear me I'm sorry somebody just my daughter's friend just called on Facebook which I really love yeah no we hear you we hear you so make it the last part you said like The credibility like my pitching and like all that or do you prefer more testimonials um I mean in an Ideal World I I like video testimonials okay um so you have like four video testimonials um you know if you can get any uh if you can get any well-known people to talk about what you're doing as like a quote that would be super amazing too I don't know if you can do that but like and I I have a hack for this I'll show a quick hack and then we'll have to get to the next person but my my quick hack on this is we have an agency that does design and copy for for clients and we just we took quotes about design and copy and stuff like that um and just quoted them to but this adds credibility you're you're piggybacking off someone else's credibility okay but you're on to something and I'm curious to see how it you know how it plays out um keep me posted we'll do man thanks I appreciate it please do and thanks for coming up thank you all right we're gonna bring on the wonderful the dynamic The Adventurous lindsy Norman I was like who is he gonna talk about and if it's not me he's in trouble oh my God I don't think people know how how blessed they are to have lindsy Norman legendary designer legendary human being uh early early Pinterest designer VP of design of hinge the dating app now head of design of mosy which probably no one's heard of no um definely not but that's uh that's why you're coming up here you want you know you want you want a jam you want a little feedback on what you're doing yes exactly yes thanks Greg um cool so yeah for everyone who's going to listen um Greg and I are close friend so he's heard a little bit about mosy but should I just give like a quick overview of where we're at cool so um I joined this company a few months ago um an idea I'm really excited about it's an app that really just wants you to spend more time with your friends out and about in the world and the premise is really that um in this nomadic world and with a lot of people working remote postco um our friendships are spread across the world so we have friends in our city and we have friends in many many other cities and the idea is really how might we help people see the friends that aren't in their current city more and the mechanisms that we are working with right now are we want to let you know when a friend of yours is visiting your City so mosy would notify you Greg Greg's in La they know that La is my city and they want me to know when you're in town um they'll let me know when we have overlapping plans so Greg just made a plan in Mexico City Lindsay you did the same thing for the same dates you and Greg are going to overlap in Mexico City next month you guys should hang and then finally um really easy alerting you of when I'm in your city so hey Lindsay's in Miami you guys should hang so it's a very very simple concept um and it works great when you are someone like me and you forced your friends to get on mosy and put where they are I think that the next big hurdle for us is how should we incentivize people to get their friends on here because until you have you know five friends there who have inputed all their plans you're you're sort of at a a standstill so um you know that that sort of like growth mindset of of how we can get excited to to get their friends to put their plans on mosy is is a big um topic of discussion right now that I'd love to kind of jam through and I I can pull up anything I don't know if it's helpful to show some of the screens oh I don't hear go for it okay let's do it and while you're while you're doing that so I think what mosy is is it basically unbundles the Instagram notes feature so a lot of people use Instagram notes to be like San Francisco LA Toronto New York like where they are but this is like dedicated only to places exactly yeah exactly and um yeah if I take if I'll give people a little overview lauron says it needs to add your plans automatically after a quick setup or people won't do it okay we originally thought that but incorrect uh so what we've learned learned what we've learned is that um people who are excited about sharing their social plans seem to really enjoy the process of adding them it's almost like because the reward is knowing who you will overlap with there's almost like a built-in uh incentive for people to do it um we've tried to make it as as quick and easy as possible I agree that if you're someone who's traveling multiple times per month which really is our target audience over time time this could be tedious but right now that's not our biggest blocker although you know we we may see that in the future by the way yeah Lin is it okay to share who the co-founder of this business is not yet okay cool well couple months all right so if I show you the plans feed um let's start here okay this is this is the my plans feed so um this is me inputting all the plans I have um through the plus button so a side benefit of this app is it makes it really easy for you to actually just track your own travel plans uh in a more delightful way than maybe referring to your calendar um and then the the real magic happens right here so if I input a plan to go to Italy on June 17th what's going to happen is as soon as mosy detects that someone else will be there it's going to give you the nice overlapping experience show you how many days you'll overlap with a friend um and hope that you will text that friend and and just make plans to hang out um but this is the tab we drop you into in the beginning that really needs some love so um when you first get into mosy we actually we need to check your contacts and we do this this is different than most apps because we're not having you add friends we'll just automatically pull your contacts and I feel like there's tradeoffs of whether like on the one hand that's helpful because you don't have to do a lot of manual work on the other hand people are a little confused in the beginning um but it's really cool because once you have a bunch of friends it's showing you where they currently are whether they're based in LA or visiting um and this is really the thing we need people to populate we want to them to share mosy with their friends so they can see how valuable it is to have all their friends here and also see their plans okay so you're getting a ton of good comments on YouTube and I want to go through it before I say my own feedback J Mick says how could mosy be used for people who aren't friends yet but could Vibe with Yeah we actually we do have a flow um when you meet someone new that's pretty cool if you add them to mosy we end up uh pull we end up creating like a contact card for you it'll text that new friend and then it'll save um they can save you in their phone as a contact but it's pulling from mosy so it'll save me with my mosy profile photo and it'll actually say uh where we met so if we were in person at Coachella it would say uh you and Lindsay are now friends uh met at Coachella June 21st powered by mosy so there is kind of that that extra feature um trying to figure out how to kind of pair that with our new travel Direction but it's a it's a good call out okay I'm GNA I'm going to lightning around this so This edit my podcast. agency says basically a specific type of person is going to enjoy this app uh your general business person not super interested in having another thing how do you think about who this is for yeah totally it it is a very specific Target demographic so the we're calling it social travel this world of social travel and we believe that people who will be incentivized to use this are traveling one to two times per month um people who are like jet Setters bouncing around a lot and is that market big enough you know for a free app well it's free for now um at some point it won't we'll have to start figuring out the monetization strategy um interestingly we're not quite we're not concerned about uh how big the audience is right now I think we're excited about finding a group of people that love it and sort of expanding from there but we recognize this is not everyone it's a little more Niche right and by the way I've this is a tip for everyone a lot of the free products that I create underneath like the sign up button where it's like sign up for free I always put free for now but not forever um that helps get people to sign up to whatever it is you're doing and it's just like a simple thing being like Oh I want to get in because I don't know in six months from now mosy could be $29.99 yeah okay a couple a couple more lightning round stuff uh I think this is an interesting one neutrino says is it possible to meet random people instead of just your friends as of now it's not um and I think it's because our philosophy is more about actually getting you to spend time in real life with the people who are close friends already it's supposed to feel pretty intimate you kind of answered a little bit about this but I want you to expand more on it if possible I'd love to just dump my flight itinerary and mosy AI does the work for me yeah yeah we're we're hearing that a lot it feels like the more manual or the more automatic this process can be the and easier the better um so it's a good call out in fact we've actually heard the opposite as well of what as well which is maybe I go to mosy first to enter the plan when I'm first excited about this trip I'm going to do um we've heard that some people will save booking the flight for later but they'll decide hey I'm definitely going to go to Mexico next month they'll enter it into mosy and then some people have even suggested they want it to push to their calendar so it'd be like mosy travel and suddenly all of its all your trips are now published to your Google calendar so we've heard it both directions which is okay a few more I just down jck says I just download this app called Corner that's like Google saved places I would love the same thing for people XY is an NYC and is down to hang yeah yeah cool Corner I've never heard of that yeah well you know Jordan's a operating partner at lay checkout so obviously he's aware of what's what's cool and up and coming so not surprised thanks Jordan uh how are you driving downloads it's a hard challenge is it just your friends now right now right we we haven't even really done like a super big launch so it's like a slow roll out out you can download in the App Store um and it's just going to connect with your contacts um Henry low love this idea so so many friends live three hours plus away I think that's especially true as you get you know older uh older in in my mind being like in your 30s I guess uh late 20s 30s um be you know people people do move away and you just you recog that it's about the people right it's not about the places I think that's a good slogan yeah I like that I'm I'm like a slogan machine yeah uh WR that down yeah so let's see if there's any more um would be cool here would be cool to Frank says would be cool to incorporate best locations for photos locations oh for to take photos Frank what do you mean by that I think I I I'm yeah it's a good question is it clicking on is it for Discovery oh J mix it's about the people not the places bars yeah yeah Frank says yes to take photos to take photos oh got it okay yeah yeah um what are my thoughts on this yeah I I have to preface it I have to be honest with you um be honest I'll be honest I I think this is going to be painful to create but I think that if you get to the other side of it you know it's you're you're a superhero and I think that's that's the only way to do consumer social right like it's either going to be really big or it's going to not be really big there's no middle in consumer social what do you think's the most painful like what are the couple biggest obstacles you think we'll have to get over I think that what's missing here is when you think of the the the last few social apps that have hit critical mass a lot of them had some sort of day time component to it and you have day and time in the sense that you you know you post your plans but there isn't something like like what is the B version of this what is something that you could put in every day that brings people back um I think that there's a big uh I've talked about this before but there's like the shift around apps having opening hours and closing hours is really interesting to me and I wonder what that is for you with mosy um to me I also wonder is there with Islands my last app which was like a kind of it was like a Discord competitor one of the things that we added which just made our growth go vertical was in order so it was essentially think of Discord for college campuses and we would only go live at a college campus when we hit 5% penetration so PE we would do a lot of marketing on school campuses to generate a lot of Buzz get people to sign into the wait list and then we had an app screen that you know in order you know we would say in order to keep University Alabama secure and safe invite three friends and people would invite their friends what do you force that or you just it we we we it would be a skip skippable event but 0% of people plus would do it because they're like oh I want to keep this safe Ah that's cool um so right I wonder if there's something like that here which is like in order to unlock features or you know is there a critical mass component yeah yeah I like it cuz yeah the Magic The Magic happens when you have about five friends we really need to get you to that point right um so those are all good ideas yeah so it's like how do you what is the okay if it's five friends what is the feature to get you to that unlocks at five friends and then what is the daily or weekly hey I forgot about mosy but I'm gonna like come back in be real style and I know people are going to be like well be real is like it's got you know falling off the cliff you know it went from I don't know 50 million active users to 40 or whatever and it's like yeah yeah true but that's because for a bunch of other reasons I think the core mechanics of Beal work and I think something like that could work for here right I like it you do have some you do have some comments Ryan and then we'll have to head someone else Ryan Aldridge definitely feels like for the 1% and that's okay maybe lean into it I think that's yeah yeah I feel that yeah so I feel that too um anything else lauron perer feels he feels a bit bearish on the idea based on his comments how many people have multiple friends who travel all the time but whom they don't talk to regular channels but still want to meet up on vacation a lot of the 1% right yeah and and Americans too fly you know do this a lot I've noticed and people who aren't I think like nomadic like people who who are hopping cities quite a bit it's really catered towards them but yeah that's all good feedback thanks so much for the time Greg and the jam and the comments thanks guys I last one last one I got Kevin York let's say this becomes a thing what happens if insa Snapchat add this feature the of travel plans yeah then we're [ __ ] we appreciate your honesty no I think you know if that happens that I mean that could happen to any any app right um it's just about staying ahead of the curve and and being the thing for people right oh my God look at this my favorite comment you're so fun Lind thanks and people thought YouTube comment YouTube comments were mean when you have Ryan Stephen Aldridge being like you're so fun I love that now I'm I'm fired up for the day thank you thanks no worries all right thanks for coming on appreciate it bye Lindsay that was awesome all right we got two more on Deck we've got Matthew and Ste uh Stefan or Stefan whatever works I see him in the back yeah okay I got you um all right we're gonna go we're gonna go with how do I pronounce this Stefan it's Stefan Stefan perfect welcome to the stage my fellow Canadian how's it going oh where where are you located Regina Saskatchewan oh H that's amazing that's amazing so um what's on your mind what's on my mind oh I've been watching your uh lately for the past two weeks I found your your YouTube and been plowing down on your content and just blows my mind of you get people's minds going on the business ideas and um I was biting on one of your business ideas with I forget what his name is but you're talking about uh AI companions yeah AI companions Uh Kevin Rose I think yeah Kevin Rose yeah so I was going through that and I'm like how can you use that well I have many different ideas for the a AI uh companion but an AI Avatar companion for for um children with disabilities like learning disabilities wow right you create a have like you copy say uh candy AI interface and uh use it where the kids can create their own avatar for themselves or with the help of their parent and uh for for them to grow with yes you know and uh you could um so they do that and it's structured for kids with dyslexia to um to all the other uh disabilities that are out out there that we can do and um it's structured you can use it with the teacher to structure for these kids their their type of uh learning because you know how that um the industry with um with teachers now is they're bombarded with like 30 kids in a classroom and there's some kids that need like special special attention you know and they need more focus and stuff like that so they could cater have an a avatar app that helps them when they can help them and get them more focused on school or whatever they needs needs that they need this is this is so good man this is this is the sip of the day I think I think I think a lot of people are uh you know okay so the Kevin Rose uh how that idea came to be is I I was in my I live in Miami and I you know most of the time and um I met this guy who was spending $10,000 a month on AI girlfriends which is insane uh so candy AI is one of them but he would basically have all these AI girlfriends and you know some of them are paid and you have to for upgrades and messaging and I think a lot of people are creating AI companions in the girlfriend boyfriend space but you know that's very to to me it's less interesting to me what's really more interesting is something like this this is like going to not only I think going to be very valuable as a business but it's also going to help people um I think that if you can make the the Avatar and the whole experience feel like a game like you're getting almost like a f a real friend um and it's not just about focus and teaching you about Focus it's also about just you know teaching you as a as a as a child to be to live a a great life and so I think that there's something here we had last time on the live stream someone who was building something in a dementia space and we talked a little bit about how AI could help in the demension space uh dementia space and I think that you know for for everyone listening just all these medical disabilities um there's so many ways where we can build companions to make the lives of these people just better and people would pay for it and insurance companies would pay for it and hospitals would pay for for it and you know so I love this idea on on on 100 levels and the the comment section is literally loving to you too um Henry low says godamn Stefan I am in I have an autistic son who needs this yeah I'm a support worker and uh it's just it's really it's really it's tough for parents L for workers but parents wow like it's it's it's really tough so I think this uh would be really really good for for everybody like like you said it's not even just about learning it's about um how to get these kids to develop like uh compassion to learning how to control their anger to to uh daily learning Focus not just focus but uh daily tasks and goals and stuff like that you know so it's just um how do you start like I a support worker I have no idea where to start how to go about doing this I want to do it definitely want to do it because you got you guys got me going well I think uh if I'm you I think you know what I call someone like you when starting a business is a nerd in Residence you're a nerd in Residence because you understand the problem space really well and and you've got a point of view that is needed but if I were you I'd probably want to build this with someone with with someone else so think you know if I'm you I need a product technical co-founder and everyone in the chat um feel free to message Stefan where where's best uh where could they find you um I'm on Instagram Instagram at uh cyber dread 03 yeah or uh s tindel my first name s tindel Ty y n d03 gmail.com yeah so hit him up because you know I think I think I'd feel more comfortable if I were you if I had a partner on this where you can be like hey I understand the space and you're going to help sort of build the product and you're gonna I'm going to iterate on the technical piece of it and when I say technical I mean like the experience and making sure that um it's high quality for for for the children and they're going to iterate on the software technical piece of it make sure that the actual product is working secure that sort of thing my my thoughts were to hire a u a psycholog just at child psychologist to to get like uh yes programs and stuff down um yeah I figured out like a team that I would need a team but the the cost to you know cost and you know how to go up go about just not just the team but how about getting uh funding and all that stuff well one step time I also think edit my podcast. agency has a good point like I would also even if you you know while you're finding the right person to work with you know there's these you know 100 day of no codes course on appsumo I've never I've never I've never read this course or anything but there are things where you could learn how to develop things in a no code way that it might just help you just at you know showing even even it's better to have something to show to a potential co-founder than nothing you know um so I think that's really smart uh also Indie hacker which is like a a a website for people who are just Solo solo business people they have a co-founder form so you should just post maybe post your idea there and see if anyone bites and just start having these conversations um yeah and and and learn like you you have two goals one is to learn learn how to be a no code developer learn how to you know learn this whole Tech world that is new to you and just do that as you know if a couple hours a day one hour a day I don't know how much time you have but just just learn re you know reading and applying your work and then the second thing is finding interesting people to have conversations with and be like here's my idea um and and that's where you're kind of a salesperson because you have to sell them on the idea of working with you yeah and that's it I love the idea to sip uh there's actually one one other thing I want to say um Shad uh Lewis Charles says repetz has a good course and startup cool school has a great co-founder software so check those places out everyone and uh thank you for coming up Stephan right thanks peace have a good one peace take care boom all right we got one last one for the day uh last but not least I should say Matthew welcome to the stage hey Greg hey everyone um really cool idea Stefan thanks for sharing uh so my idea is basically that uh oh I work in an art gallery so this is an art space startup idea the pain point for artists is that they have an art a stock room basically full of art you know most of the value of the art world is in stock rooms so millions of dollars you know just sitting there um what galleries do like my one is they basically come in they pick a few artworks you know seven eight Max for a show uh and they don't really work that hard I see to sort of sell the work and definitely not on a large scale you know their client lists are quite narrow um a lot of the smaller ones where a lot of this sort of art is being moved um and uh basically that's a problem you know I feel like artists are getting kind of hard done by you know I see it my friends are artists there sort of a bit of a gap and some value you know sitting there um what I would suggest as a solution and I'm really Keen to hear your feedback and anyone else who has ideas is to basically allow artists to create you know affiliate links that anyone could then go and sell their art um you know Drive the traffic back to to their page um and you know take a commission a small commission um you know big or small I guess they can pick if they want to sort of incentivize it um and this would really take advantage of all this kind of current access to tools um that we have you know marketing tools everybody's social media networks you know if you see a really cool artwork that you like there's a high chance your friends would like it if you just kind of share it on your socials maybe you'll get some how doesn't this exist already I don't know yeah this doesn't make any sense because the the what you're talking about exist on every other category it's kind of why I thought about it for art so yeah it's it's really strange you know a lot of the a lot of the things in the art world they're kind of guarded by this this culture I don't know what it is but um yeah I just think there's heaps of art sitting there so I was wondering is there an ACP play that you feel could really kind of like bolster something like this and yeah if you want to kind of jam on it well I have a question on the gallery so if like let's just say myself like let's say I I find a piece of art that's you know stored in the in the back room that I like um that I want to post to my followers I get a link that I could share with my and I get a cut and then they so we're are we splitting we're basically splitting it or what what do you what do you see the business model being right so basically how the art World Works currently is um if they're going through a gallery the gallery would take maybe 50% of the artwork sale price you know if it's a $10,000 piece they get five grand just for sort of supplying it to the uh small list um the other side of it is Agents so what that would be is basically an artist would approach someone who sort of has connections um and then they would take maybe 30% between 10 and 30% depending on who they are um of that artwork price uh when it sells so this sort of software I think I guess you could put it lower if you get enough people you know using the the software as in if you had enough people sort of yeah in the system but you could start at 10% and that would still be really great for artists and anyone selling it you know if you sort of gain some skills at this yeah I think you could you could really uh yeah move some arts on the on the ACP this is how i' started ACP wise and and for those you don't know ACP audience Community product it's the funnel I use in all my businesses start with the audience convert to a community and then build the product for for for the a for audience to me I think that there's an opportunity and I'd probably start on Twitter um because Instagram is the the art that's where artists go uh it's the number one platform for artists um I'd go on Twitter and I would actually just write the stories of expensive artwork that has sold and to who you know the story is about buying extensive artwork and to who and I think this I think you know sometimes you'll see you know SES or Christies or whatever sorry Christies you see um oh this this this Picasso just sold for $8.3 million to so and so but it's it's written in like a press release format and it's not really written for the internet and I just think that there's so many interesting stories behind why people buy things who they are uh what the art piece is and that's the format and I would write those stories daily um and then what are you going to do you're going to you're going to build you know and maybe you know maybe you you you grab the account the art the art guy or you know something like that or I something like that and then you basically you know build up this audience and then now you have an audience of people into art right because the only reason they're following you is they're they're into art so then you can go to Galleries and be like hey I'm not just you know math Matthew unor Ramy uncore you know um not that at all I'm I'm this I I I I'm Matthew but I do run this account it's got 100,000 followers I I generate between five and 10 million impressions a month and by the way I would also go on LinkedIn uh no one is talking about art on LinkedIn right but you know how many how many active users does LinkedIn have currently I'm not sure but it's in the M you know 900 million yeah and that's why people you know it kind of grinds my gears a little bit when people are like oh LinkedIn is so cringe it's like are you gonna are you saying 900 million people are cringe you know no of course not there's tons of opportunity on LinkedIn so I would do that I do those stories uh on both those platforms build those audiences uh and then start building the platform I think this is a lowrisk idea it works in other spaces uh the technical aspect of building it is is relatively straightforward um and and to me it's a sip so for if I'm you if I'm if I'm Matthew ramore first thing I'm doing is I'm I'm getting I'm coming up with a name and that's catchy and and and a handle that's catchy on on Twitter um and then and then once you feel confident in the format um then I I start bringing it to LinkedIn and okay and just see where it goes cool cool thanks Greg yeah good advice on the LinkedIn and Twitter so thank you of course of course good luck see you soon there you have it everyone another hour has gone by that was super fun uh did you enjoy that I mean I enjoyed that I hope people got value out of it but let me know if you enjoy that I will do more of these and uh and my hope is that like I said I hope that your creative juices are flowing you know you might not want to start an artart business tomorrow but you might be like hey maybe there's an idea for an affiliate platform for a completely other space that no one's thinking of and that's what this is about you know I saw a tweet uh today saying uh idea people I'm gonna pull it up actually I think it was something like idea people like don't don't spend time with idea people something like that and you know that's not true ideas are really important and ideas help you clarify what you want to actually be building and ideas are Arbitrage if you if if if Matthew for example knows to go build on LinkedIn in this P particular format he's going to outcompete other people's so um anyways this has been cool I'm getting I'm looking at the comments people people liked it uh super awesome it's been real I'm going to end the show thank you everyone for for joining uh a little ask for me uh how about I don't know share this with friends share this with friends subscribe to the YouTube the startup ideas podcast on Apple podcast and Spotify go follow that And subscribe rate it tell everyone you know about startup ideas podcast

dude I would pay $113,000 a month for the ability to have a YouTube channel because I'm attracting people you know interested in the same things I'm interested in and you know I could create products then I can sell them and services and stuff like that I don't have to live in New York City or live in San Francisco it you know because I have a YouTube channel now and I have a podcast and that's the whole point of the owned owned media right like why are we harping on this constantly it's because what this allows you have the rails you can put whatever you want on it and it's almost like you're not even playing the game at the pro level unless you're doing this now especially like this younger generation like I am watching them print money on YouTube and then they use that as a subsidy to go build out these productized services and build out these SAS companies and again it's just it's just this new way to do this B like business model which is so interesting to me I feel like it's it's changing the whole dynamic of how this even functions or works [Music] they should play music by the way when I wanted to play music like it just like you know have like thunder struck or something tot ACDC classic dad rock or Creed With Arms Wide Open Cody Schneider he's back on the Pod startup ideas pod one of your your YouTube videos on the Pod has like 40 or 50,000 views I'm it's insane I've just decided that I am uh this is like a residency for me the chain you know Vegas has the chain smokers and then Greg's pot has me I'm going to come back whenever they want totally you send me a text you're on and you sent me a text with a bunch of I think nine really amazing ideas so I want you just to get right into it let's go let's go quick before we do that can we talk about this dude that did the cricket thing I'm so hyped about this okay so this guy dm' me on LinkedIn and he works at like a big 10 honestly a big five marketing agency like it's like you know top of the list one of them it employs one of the you know the biggest amounts of people in the US uh that's in that space and uh spun it up got two customers already he's just running Facebook ads getting like 50 Cent emails just doing a drip nurture basically upselling them and he's like yo this is I'm like from the outside looking in It's Gonna he's gonna build a company on top of this and I'm hyped for him so anyways this is what we live for all right it's like people hear this stuff and then they go and they put it out in the wild and and tell Greg and I about it so anyway so you put out that idea on the Pod he took it he probably built it in 72 hours right 100% it was like a weekend project and it looks like he's just using off-the-shelf tooling right so just Shopify and then some like Shopify apps it's the whole thing that entire like company is that and it's a it's a SAS business right like that is a functioning SAS business by all all metrics he's got a good name with it too what is it uh SVG something he's really yeah I think something like that yeah SVG collections.com and uh yeah I mean this is I think the exact execution of what I envisioned this this would be he basically did it and has the skill set to actually like ship on it and it sounds like you're just going to cash flow it like this is his whole plan which is amazing and is he using AI to create the designs yeah so that whole buildout is using these AI tools right so you're basically using mid Journey you're prompting it to make like a black and white image with a white background you know black only and there's a promp you have to just figure out the prompting if you just Google like how to do uh you know basically PNG images with with mid Journey you'll find it and then based off of the keywords people are searching for goes and builds out these Collections and you can then take those image you upscale them use an AI vectorizing tool to turn it into a vector which is what an sgv file is right at its core and then at that point uh he basically has unlimited amounts of of products or SKS that he can sell on this and then the structure of the business is you basically have to there's all these free products on it but you have to be signed up so you have to give your email to basically download all the three ones and then all the premium ones you have to be paying to download those so there's a bump pricing model right uh and when you think about that funnel super easy it's just like cool offer some type of free download they can go and get all these free free tools or sorry free svgs and then uh if you know they're constantly going to see like your most popular ones you just make them you make them pay while gate that's the whole the whole model around this that I would do and I imagine that's what he's going to do as well so totally he's charging $3.99 a month $3.99 a month there's no real cost associated with it right like his costs are are his meta ads that he's doing so this is a beautiful business and I think just for people listening don't just listen like go take notes and actually do the thing because people are doing it they're listening to this pod and they're they're cash flowing you know 10,000 $100,000 a month sometimes so it's kind of crazy 100% And I think that that's the thing with this is like it looks tiny right now right but like when you think about the audience like cricket there's 10 million users like he can blow this up into a huge business by just being like a barnacle on the whale of this massive company right and this is already validated like this is he you know this this is going to make money like zero there's zero doubt anymore right it's now just execution and so I mean that for me this is like a this is the Highlight You' live for this type of thing when people actually go and do the stuff that you're like suggesting from a business all this is junk food right at the end of the day unless you actually go and ship on it so totally so you saw that that that fired you up and then you came up with nine ideas just from that and here you are what's idea number one idea number one um so LinkedIn video is about the pop off I've just got some data for from a friend he did 700,000 uh impressions in seven days he's been doing stuff on LinkedIn for two weeks and all he's doing he's like Instagram Tik Tok famous already he talks about like business content on those platforms he's just been porting that content over to LinkedIn like vertical video and it's just been ripping so he only had 2700 followers when he started doing this but still got that many Impressions so the the reason this is happening is LinkedIn is rolling out like a for you page feed just like Tik Tok so what this means is it's just blue ocean the content over there it's terrible right like everybody is like it's just you know bdrs talking to like AES like that's that's what's going on here and so what the opportunity is is basically building out a company that goes and services Founders and the idea is is you basically like would interview a Founder you'd come up with you know here's these seven different scripts we'd write these scripts based off the conversation you have so imagine you sit down once a week and you interview the founder for an hour you take those ideas you turn it into scripts and then you send that back to the founder they just sit down they record it you you give them like recording like show them the inflection the pacing the whole thing they just are mimicking it and they can crank these out in like 10 minutes is what I've seen and then you send it back to that agency and then they create these clips and they go and schedule them and uh this is already validated like I had a friend just buy this from like another person um for like two grand a month and it's like really what you're doing is you're riding this wave the selling mechanism is be that I would go after is like there's this huge opportunity for Founders to create massive personal brand with this free reach LinkedIn is give like providing and then it also creates like an inbound you know generation for your your company but that is this I think there's just like that's a wave that can be ridden right now from a company standpoint like if you just have a little bit of execution progress and know how to work with offshore teams like this is easily I I bet you could get this to 30k you know a month in like probably 90 to 180 days like no questions asked so hey everyone if you're anything like me you've got a ton of design that you need websites landing pages emails social assets you name it but you don't just want beautiful landing pages or beautiful websites you want the stuff that's going to convert you want the stuff that's going to actually drive value that's where design scientist.com comes in it's an agency that for one monthly price will do all your design work all your copy work all your engineering and do stuff that actually scales your Revenue you don't need a designer you need a design scientist let's go design scientist.com I liked it so much I invested in the business a lot of people ask me oh how did how did I get such a big Twitter audience and I got a big Twitter audience when threat two things happen threads the ability to create a thread you know they un that was that wasn't a feature and became a feature on Twitter and then number two the feed was uh latest and it moved to algorithmic so all of a sudden your content was getting recommended to new followers exactly my content game didn't change it was just the platform changed so what you're saying is really smart you're saying that the platform LinkedIn is is changing and there's going to be a bunch of B2B creators that are going to take advantage of it but they're going to need sort of a middleman uh to to to facilitate it right th% it's and that's the biggest thing with all of this is like I'm any company I'm trying to start I'm looking for like a larger Trend that I can attach myself to right because I you don't want to ever educate the market like what you're trying to do is just sell things that people already want to buy right like what's going to happen right now is they're going to start seeing these creators like just pop off on LinkedIn it's already happening like it's happening at this moment it is actively happening I know like 10 people that are already famous in this space that are all doing this and just going ham on this as a channel right and they're getting like 500 engagements with this content with only like 3,000 followers on their account like that's unheard of that's crazy that doesn't exist right it's it's it's the same moment that existed on Twitter for you like you know when you basically grew your audience and so the the angle here is like Founders want to do that they know they need to do that they have VC dollars and so you basically go to them and be like yo this is a done for you solution it's going to take uh you know let's just throw out a number like two hours of your mental energy three hours of your mental energy a week and we're going to handle everything else for you we'll do all the data analytics we'll get smarter with this and then they start to understand okay cool like imagine you uh give the like an affiliate Link in the uh like the visit my website section on your LinkedIn profile and then like whatever if you're adding a call to action to the comments and then you can start to track okay cool like these videos were the best performers let's like more like this less like this and it creates a a flywheel so again I I I saw your Tweet where you were like uh you know nobody's talking about this but there's Founders that built their personal brands on the back of like VC subsidies and like this is an angle this another thing that you can basically do for that for that exact idea you can just you know go and capitalize on this but the people are going to want this they're going to need this and and so it's just a company that's like right for the taking yeah to me there's the entry level pricing which is probably like 2500 bucks a month mon with which is just exactly what you said but then for like five to eight grand a month you can do lead magnets as a service so it's like every month we'll create a lead lead magnet for you because like a dripa course totally exactly totally yeah totally yeah and then the third thing is probably just design help so it's like we'll do your you know your B your your banner your cover art will go and create you know beautiful infographics so you put that together Founders and that's the idea how do you actually get to Founders though yeah I think that that will be the hardest part probably what it turns into is like you are doing your own channel like you're doing your own clip making and posting on the platform and be like you want to do this for yourself like book an intro call it's probably like a community play honestly it's like drip them into a community and then upsell them into like a service like this and where it's like everybody's talking about how do they grow on LinkedIn like you make the LinkedIn Community for the people that are trying to grow their accounts and then they're going to see oh this is really hard right because it is really hard like I'm talking to you know like I'm working with like two uh you know two people I know that are really like have deep knowledge in this space to try to figure this out and we you know there's no way I don't have that I have the mantle bandwidth or energy to figure this out right so think about that and then that's what really what you're selling you're selling the ideation the creative components of this and for these creators man like it's like I mean this is a no-brainer like they sit down and can crank these scripts out in like I've seen them do it and like three minutes right because they just know the Cadence they know the sequencing all of this um and it's just another play like it's it's just it's just a product highe service built around a Creator that's in a specific category but this category is business which we know because we're both doing this is like a huge category where a lot of money is sloshing around so that's the opportunity here yeah absolutely here's how I would do the community aspect so I would get the domain Founders going viral on linkedin.com and I'd create a free community where every week I'd give one tip on how to go viral on LinkedIn like what's working and then one breaking down another founder and why it's working so it's like this person Cody Schneider just got a thousand likes on this post let me break down why that matters you do a monthly call where you uh you know everyone kind of comes in and and it's like a peer-to-peer group and at the end you just say like hey you know we've got this service if you want the done for you service it's going to cost XYZ totally I think it's brilliant and I mean it just again shows your expertise and knowledge it's a repeatable thing and you're already on the platform doing this research already you're just repurposing the stuff that you're finding into into content that you're using as a sales like tool right so again another easy one look for Trends you know the the high level idea here is like look for things that are bigger than you that are happening and then how do you attach yourself to them it's the classic Playbook like especially when you're trying to bootstrap a thing or self-funded it's the it's the it's the only way to do it that I've seen it work when you try to convince the world of anything it's not going to happen right someone in the comment section is goingon to be like but you know LinkedIn isn't going to be uh be video first forever and then in 12 months you're going to have to shift your business and it's like well even if that is the case at least now you have a 1 million AR business with a bunch of Founders and you'll just sell them another service to help them grow in LinkedIn thousand per. I think the other piece of it too like as a Founder like somebody that's building this audience like you get to a scale where you can just do whatever you want like Greg you have a huge Twitter right you can just basically do whatever you want you don't even have to play the game and things are going to hit and that's like there's this there's this Tipping Point with all these platforms that you can arrive at and once you're there it's like the game the rules change of the game right and so I think that's just another piece like on you know not on the business owner side but on the like why you should even be thinking about building this audience here uh because soon as you have that I mean you can just cross you know basically like cross promote all of your other social channels and then you have own Distribution on every place that you're trying to so all right my appetite is is wet you know I had some some bread and I'm ready for idea number two hell yeah all right right the next one is a is a one graph business um I'm going to share my screen real quick and show you so I stumbled on this the other day AI automation is the keyword so this is the graph showing the growth of the search volume for that keyword over the basically its whole existence so this is insane to me whenever I see this I immediately you know Sirens are going off what does this mean how can I get involved with it and so what people are looking for is basically like how do I set up and again this is one of those things that's obvious like people that are in this know this already people are trying to figure out how do I create automation with like make.com and zapier and chat GPT apis and you know basically just setting up these systems but all these companies like if you look at McKenzie what's happening right now is they're just doing this for Enterprise but there's this massive opportunity for like SBS in small business to basically provide this as a solution right and so I mean the small version of this is you build a consulting company that does this sets this up where you ined with them and you do a Sprint for whatever three months and automate away the better companies probably you go and you create some type of produ high service where you have like an embedded AI automation engineer and all they do is just figure out how to automate like every part of your business that they can and that's easily like you know I you probably charge eight grand a month for something like that just because you're you're the cost savings is like instant for these companies because it's a lot of it's just like paper pushing that you're automating but I think the bigger thing here is they're looking people are just looking for how do I implement this in my company and that is the larger wave that's happening and so if you can just insert yourself here as like a thought leader and probably the distribution strategy I like I would just bid on that keyword and then every keyword related to like zappier make.com any of these automation tools integrat whatever I think that changed they make actually but they like go and basically create tutoral like use perplexity AI to write tutorials for setups and then have a call to action that's like oh you like one AI automation consulting or service like you know a book of Discovery call that creates all of your inbound and then it's probably a YouTube channel on top of that but that is again just like another insane business you could probably build and you own a company in this space already which is like kind of doing this for my understanding but I don't know if you talk about it but yeah I'll talk about it I'll talk about it and the reason I'll talk about it is just the space is so big that I don't care if other people come in so we we built a AI newsletter community business called you probably need a robot.com helping people be more productive using Ai and the biggest lesson we learned is people were asking for AI but what did they really want automation so I think that in the SMB space there's huge demand for automation because what is automation automation is cost savings and everyone wants to save cost so it's an easy sell so I think from a pricing perspective what you need to do is just figure out okay if I'm going to save the these these guys $200,000 how much can I realistically charge them and that's like the mental model that you need to come up with 20 grand just that's the number yeah that's the number right I mean that's a way to think about it and we're actually launching something in July in the space with and the beauty is we have this media company that we can just like launch these things to totally and that's the whole point of the owned owned media right like why are we harping on this constantly it's because what this allows for you have the rails you can put whatever you want on it like anything you want to get out in public like again the company can zero to one in in 30 days and it's sustainable it's like already cash flow positive and it's sustaining itself when you have these own media channels and so the again I I it's so easy it's just like what like content is a grind right like that's the challenge with it it's like how do you not do burnout but it's like just figuring out that that you know what is that thing that I can do over and over again weekly monthly you know daily that's not going to kill me and then how do I put people behind me to basically run those operations on it but what kills me and what's so funny is that like we were talking about this I think on the live stream but if you go talk to like like a banker or like the hours that people are like oh content's hard it's like this is not that many hours like in all reality like it's not that gr like it's not that grindy as people think it is it's it's just like can you show up and do it consistently that's the hardest part with this but totally and I think it's also like spend time on figuring out what's your tone what's your voice what's your personality what's your style what's your structure like what's your format of the content and then how are you going to basically bring a pipeline of ideas of content ideas in and then use that system to help you create a lot of that content that's what the game is you're more think of yourself as more of a you know an editor than a writer a curator uh you know you're you're you're you're conductor of the orchestra you're not playing the flute thousand per thousand per. I mean that's really just good business ownership right as well like you're trying to basically figure out all the puzzles if you're that deep in it even um but a lot of the times in the early days there needs to be founder energy to like break the laws of physics and get into orbit without that it just doesn't happen in my experience for companies and then once you get to that place like okay we're in orbit now then it's like okay how do I step back as much of them as possible I love that quote from the the kingo's founder I can't remember his name but it's like get out of your business and on top of it I just always think that that's such a simple way to say the the core of the idea and it feels you know with the content side it feels like the same thing here and the company we talked about in you know at the beginning of the episode is literally that right it's like okay cool like I'm help I'm letting other people that are experts in it and for a lot of a lot of Founders that are legit like they could go figure this out right but they have a I mean I got a million other things that I'm trying to manage at this time so if I can just have somebody I show up for an hour and like I know that content is going to come out of that it's a no-brainer right and so it's that same it's that same thing here cool I love it what's what's idea three yeah I want to do I I want to talk about this like AI graphic designer thing I it's I have a tweet that's like going viral right now which is hilarious like as we record this but it's wild to me that there has there hasn't been of these made yet that's good like and I get pitch these all the time like in the comments right now people are like oh we built that and it's like no you didn't like all I'm talking about is like I just want something where I give it a brand Style guy like here's our colors here's our logos here's our like fonts and you know now make me a uh you know a podcast thumbnail right or like make me an email header for a newsletter or whatever that is and it just like I don't even need it to be perfect I just want it to be like good enough so that I can then be like oh I like this I'm going to throw it in figma and I'm basically going to recreate it something like that almost like a co-pilot in a way and it's insane to me that something like I haven't seen something that does this yet it'll just like all the ones I've seen it just goes off in on this tangent and you end up in no man's land from a design standpoint or it just looks like you know it was made in PowerPoints in 2009 so I don't know if you've seen anything like this but the other piece of this as a software like this is something that people are searching for they're isn't a good solution so if you just figure out like a small version of this this is a 100% like a sass that can be built out and I think you could sell it super easily like what's crazy is canva hasn't moved into this space already they like they I feel like they're positioned so well where you could just like prompt and it like creates the thing that you're kind of imagining and looking for based off of your brand sty like your brand style guide but again it just it just doesn't exist and so anyway I'm curious your thoughts on that I mean it doesn't exist yet I think they're going to be going I mean they're going in that direction canva recently did did you watch any of their they did like a massive event no I didn't see it no one on Tech Twitter no one on Tech Twitter was talking about it and like that's the event like forget WWDC you know the canva event actually had like so much that if you're trying to create profitable startups go go watch it go watch what they announced dude some of these titles are insane yeah yeah yeah it's wild so they're definitely going into AI territory and I could see them doing some of this but I I think that even if they do it it doesn't matter there's always going to be demand for hey I need this asset ASAP and I'm I'm worse than you know I I I'm worse even even even if I'm good at canva I'm not the best at canva so so I think there's if it was just like imagine like an AI align thing like you like throw all the content you want to be in there and then it just like basically because that's really what I think people are actually looking for is like how do I have it so it has the proper white space so it feels right how you know it's it's based off the like I'm just imagining like I I I put in the title the text that I want right I maybe I drop in like a background image and I'm like okay cool like turn this into 20 different Facebook ads based off of my brand style guys and it just likeets those out right like that's I think what we're we're talking about here it's not like and again to your point I think you made a really valid point of like it's it just has to be better than I am it doesn't have to be graphic designer level like if it's an 80% of a graphic designer but a like a hundred times faster than me you know putting in a a request to my graphic designer and then I have to wait on them and like the whole that whole thing like if I can just get something out super quickly like you have a market there if the if the pricing is right on it all this stuff you I think you again you could do super cheaply when it's augmented by these by AI do you know design pickle totally yeah I mean they're OG design OG been around for I don't know 10 15 years they probably do uh you know 30 million a year in in revenue and from what I've seen they generate a ton of customers from meta ads I'm constantly seeing their ads on Instagram and they charge about $4.99 I believe $499 a month so it's very very cheap to get in there I think that if you're going to go build this the way to do it is it's like $99 a month 99 and design pickle only allows you to have one thing in the queue at a time like if you had it where you could like multi-thread so you give it yeah or he even here's a list of prompts and then it's working on those simultaneously I I think that that is something that would be incredibly valuable to every company I mean I I know want it just like I was writing an email newsletter this morning I'm like [ __ ] I just want this header to be like in our style like I I can build it in figma but I don't like I just you know can we just have this exist in the next two seconds right and I just copy it over drop it in like that's the that's the and maybe that's what it's built on top of it's like it's built on top of CA and that's your distribution strategy it's built on top of figa and it's like just another subscription outside of it you kind of get platformed that way I mean it's it's hard to build you know really complex UI things but I don't know I just think that this like even if you it just gave back like variations of ideas like okay here's 20 of them or something I don't know there if we think about what's happening in the AI writing space where it's like hey we give it Source material and then we're having it right based off that Source material and it's making way better outputs right so when I'm writing from the general knowledge of the L like the llm it's super like it's not it's pretty average um but when I give it awesome Source material it's going to create really decent output is what we're seeing so it's just that same idea but it's applied in the graphic design space right like here's these brand style guides like I'm just giving you kind of like a box that you have to work in now go build within that box and like what I found is that by putting constraints on these AI to like just any of these AI things like you can but that those limitations allow for it to create way better outputs or the outputs that you're looking for more you know most of the time cool I like this one I think I do think that the pricing like undercutting design pickle like design pickle my guess is they have a ton of offshore Talent right so the reason they're able to charge so cheap is it's it's offshore but my guess is they're not going to create a $99 a month plan right so you can you know they rode the offshoring wave you can raid uh ride the AI wave and there's a business here 100% all right let's keep the pace going just got through the Double Espresso so I'm feeling energy now right this is another done for you service for Founders uh so every founder wants to have a newsletter none of them want to write it and so that same thing we were talking about where you sit down with them for an hour I mean this could probably be the same service it's like you know another offering that you have but you sit down for an hour you interview them and you take that transcript and you turn it into a newsletter and so how do you grow the newsletter a lot of the time what I would do is I'd go approach people that already have like a Twitter following a LinkedIn following something like that and I'd be like okay we're going to get all those people that already followed you on those platforms onto this newsletter and like basically be a sub sub to the newsletter so how do you actually do that so you can actually we just found this recently but you can go scrape uh people's emails from Twitter so like I've just been running this scraper scraping emails from uh like my Twitter followers and then using a validation tool to like okay are these real or not and like the data I'm getting back is like almost like 40 to 50% of them are valid emails which is is insane so the testing that we're running is just sequencing them into the newsletter and seeing what's happens right so you can do the same thing on LinkedIn use a tool called like sales ql I think is what it's called but you can again go and scrape all the connections of a person um and then from that same thing uh you can you basically sales QA extracts the emails you go and validate it sequence them into the newsletter and then uh at that point like you can probably get a list and again I would go after these people that already have these followings they want to do this but they just don't have the operations piece behind it so again another super simple business and that that would be really the whole thing just like set that up and then the other component of it is like build these automations for them use something like Phantom Buster where it's like every new person that tries to connect with the found with the per with your client automatically send them like a subscribe to my newsletter link uh with some type of like call to action or offer and then the same thing uh with Twitter anybody that follows you automated DM that goes out to them to follow and that's how you continue to grow this um but I I I think that uh and then again you just as they follow you you just every month you go and scrape them see slowly sequence them in like 200 a day to that list and then just you're basically writing the content off of the founders ideas and it could be even just like a Ride Along on their business of what they're doing right but I think this larger theme that we're starting to see is like these founder-led like founder Le companies are what's going to happen like there you're a Founder is basically turning into a media company themselves and I'm just imagining like what the Bei founder uh like Tyler's doing with his his newsletter that's just like updates on the company how do you do a version of that but for like every founder that's have some type of uh audience that they've already built on these other platforms and then just run that on the background for them and again on the when you interview them you have the language that they use you have the ideas that they use you're basically just translating their their you know raw data that they're providing you into a tone style and voice and you can prompt it like yo just take the here's an Insight from this episode here's the transcript you know write uh write a a whatever an two paragraph uh like section based off this transcript about this insight and the tone style and voice that this transcript has and you'll get it you know 95% of the way there from a voice standpoint human layer over the top of that but I think the grow the growing side of this super easy too you just go like DM these people and it's just like send them hey we grew this newsletter for XYZ person right show them the data for it and it's like all you have to do is you show up an hour hour a week you we record the session and that's it we handle everything else it's all handled on the backside and you get this own distribution channel that like creates deeper relationships with your with your followers and you know your customers Etc so yeah I like this idea for two for a few reasons one is Founders are going to look at this as row as they're going to be like okay I'm going to pay you $100,000 a year but the lifetime value of a customer to me is worth $25,000 so I just need four of these to work so I love that and I think that's like a new trend just like looking at audience as BR as return on audience spend so that's that's number one and number two everyone knows that being dependent on any of these one platforms is a bad idea so everyone's trying to get off these plat forms into email or text so this is just selling schmuck Insurance 100% you know what I mean this is selling schmuck Insurance don't be a schmuck have an email list is like the tagline so simple 100% The Branding could be super cool too like around that idea right yeah like just like somebody with like you know they got their hands in their hair like just like oh God I just got platformed on yeah oh no dude did you hear about Roger oh what happened to Roger oh Roger got Roger got thought it was a real exactly Roger Roger's gone dude it's insane anyway and it's like that is I think that's just an easy win and everybody's trying to do this and trying to figure out how to do [Laughter] this I like how I like how when I was like first of all are you even friends with a person named Roger do you even know any I know Roger I hate him I've never met a Roger I like I don't know about you yeah that's true actually I don't know what it is about Rogers but uh they're polarizing put it that way they're like olives they're like olives that's right Rogers are like olives but yeah I was like did you hear what happened to ro Roger and your I saw your heart drop dude immediately I was like wait who is it somebody we know and I saw your heart drop because you're basically not wearing a shirt right now so I can see your heart it's Peak it's Peak summer here in Denver right now and I am dying I'm just only in linen and shorts that are way too small but you have to I guess show some thigh otherwise I look like a dad I'm out here I'm just trying to wear car hearts and everybody's like you're not a painter right you work online you have soft hands you do have soft hands I mean just just because you do cold emailing doesn't mean your hands are uh got calluses on them 100% they're dirty but not callous exactly that's right all right I like that idea very straightforward idea number five what's idea number six okay six this one is we did a live stream and I I literally can't stop thinking about this idea but it's basically YouTube thumbnails it's really similar to the Cricut one that initially like you know everybody kind of got obsessed about but it's YouTube thumbnails just like a whole library of them as a subscription so YouTube is is owning the Creator space like why is that happening because monetization is built into the platform they have the best RPMs and so like you can just basically make decent money off of your content if you're good right that's the whole concept behind it um why does every tick tocker Instagram person you know anybody everybody ends up on YouTube in the long you know in the in the long run over a long enough time Horizon the reason for that is because the monetization is is so powerful and so with that said I think the opportunity is basically you build this whole library of these uh thumbnails that you can just it's like plug and playay uh you can go you know access any one of them you swap out assets like it's like you know your face gets swapped in and out that type of thing and then the go to market strategy here super straightforward you just go and scrape every YouTuber's email address you can do this like go to Fiverr search scrape YouTube url your scrape YouTube emails you give them like specifications of where you want it to be like I want over 10,000 Subs in the USA and uh you know whatever maybe a keyword category you want them in and then you go and you just like cold email them basically access to this tool like hey we built a library of thumbnails and maybe it's like some free offer initially it's like you know they get access to a 100 and it's like if you want access to 100,000 then it's a it's a paid tier you know or access to 10 initially or something like that um but that that would be my whole dis be my whole distribution strategy and I think there's a huge play here like especially like this younger generation like I am watching them print money on YouTube and then they use that as a subsidy to go build out these product highz services and build out these SAS companies and then you know they go on Money Twitter and they're like yo I've got negative CAC and every every old head is like looking down at them they're like you little [ __ ] like what like like how are you doing this basically right um so I think that's the opportunity or the larger wave that you can ride with this like I think YouTube is becoming the social media and they're owning it right they're owning long form they're owning podcasting they're owning short form they're owning monetization like all of the Tailwinds are there for this platform to kind of just be the winner and so I think that's where this goes long term so when I post to YouTube me and my producer come up with like a few title and thumbnail ideas and then we kind of just hope for we pray for the best that's basically it right so I think that there's an opportunity to first of all not just do only thumbnails combine it with titles because titles are equally as important and then putting putting data behind oh this title is yeah is and I knew you were I knew you were about to go there this this speaks you right this idea around okay there's a 75% probability that if you use this title uh it's going to generate 25% more traffic because the search volume the this the that and I can you can even like I use uh vid IQ yeah and vid IQ has a ton of really good data and this this may be something that you like pitch to vid IQ or work you I don't know if they have an API or anything but the data is available totally 100% I think if you put that to of like hey this video like here's the thumbnail title combo and it got this many Impressions this many views you know just pull that data out of YouTube and put that in the data set so like their whole library is that right um I mean you know create some filtering capabilities within it as well like also like a time thing because like what I found again people way smarter than me that tell me how all these platforms function what I found is that there's like just like there's Trends on social um like you know like Instagram Etc or Tik Tok like with with videos or ideas going viral it's the same idea with like YouTube thumbnail and title combinations so there's almost like a a shelf life to all of these where you have to you know you have to be cycling through this that if you just use the same kind of form format over people get uh there there's fatigue to it right it's just like ad fatigue it's the same idea they almost get they get blind to that and so the idea here is you could basically like it's this constant feed which creates a stickiness from a user standpoint as well right it's like hey we're doing all this data scraping for you we're pulling in all these variations and then you're basically providing these templates for them and I don't even know if you'd have to have it be templates to begin with like I just kind of want access to the YouTube thumbnail and titles like this guy this kid I'm working with that's like helping me on the YouTube side like this is literally that's actually what I'm paying him to do it's like cool like here's my product and I'm going to go find all these like YouTube thumbnail and title variations that are like could be remixed or like into what my product offering is right and that's re like he just has this pulse on how to do that but I think there's like a layer in there that you could add some type of software that would augment that that that ability to go and find those and then you just pass it on to your graphic designer um I mean you could have you know some AI version of this is like how you know what's the how would I uh how would I take this title and translate it into you know whatever for for the video that I'm about to post but I think really it's just like show them a library of ideas with the data attached and that is where all the value comes from like you know canva what's interesting you know we've been talking about a lot today but like they have all these templates that are there what I want to know is like do these templates actually work like especially if it's marketing related like what's the data like okay if I send this in an email is this going to be effective and that is a really interesting idea when you kind of scale that up like what are these other places that this can be applied in right um so I I think there's probably like tons of other businesses that are just this it's like aggregating like what is working and then what's the trend analysis on top of that for all of these marketing channels that people are investing in currently yeah I like this I also like you know it's just one of those things where more and more people just and you said it yourself they want to be creators they want to be YouTubers and it's interesting cuz now it's bleeding in bleeding into like the B2B space there's so many Founders I talk to now that are like secretly like yeah I want to be like bit of a YouTuber you know like I want 100,000 Subs on YouTube and I I'm like what 100% dude I everyone I'm talking to is doing this because it's like it's a clout thing which is weird but the the the stranger part and I think the layer like you know the higher level layer of this is it's yeah exactly like what does it say I can't see you to blurry right now so the last 30 days on my YouTube 263,000 views and that's like long form you know insane totally 31,000 hours of time what's the ad reg for that to give people perspective I'm gonna give it at the end I'm not I'm I'm not just GNA give it to to people how this works it's not how YouTube Works bro I thought you want to be a YouTuber and then I added 6,300 subscribers in the last 28 days and I made an estimated revenue of $3,000 totally which subsidizes a year totally subsidizes the cost of that that building that audience right dude I would pay $113,000 a month for the for the ability to have a YouTube channel th% because I'm attracting people you know interested in the same things I'm interested in and you know I could create products then I can sell them and services and stuff like that so it's I don't have to live in New York City or live in San Francisco it you know because I have a YouTube channel now and I have a podcast 100% you can get like deep trust in a one to many format and which just creates inbound for you but the bigger thing like to your point of like you no longer have to be there right like I think that that is again another reason like why I started building own media it's like I don't have any pedigree right like I'm from bum [ __ ] Idaho the sticks right in comparison to everybody else that's in this game and so this was like a way to get a leverage point right and so because of that like anybody globally can now do this if you have good ideas and you're sharing them regularly in at scale like this is this way to do that and oh by the way you can get paid for it as well and like totally why is YouTube G to win podcasting I mean we talk about this all the time offline right it's because of this right like you can have like in an hour and a half long video I can have what three to four mid roll ads occur I mean [ __ ] it's just a printer when you get to scale right and so you're making that simultaneously you know it goes all the you know down funnel into their companies and again it's just it's just this new way to do this B like business model which is so interesting to me I feel like it's it's changing the whole dynamic of how this even functions or works and it's almost like you're not even playing the game at the pro level unless you're doing this now like I look at the stand store guy like he's funded right like classic path but he's also doing this and I'm like you're playing at a caliber like at a level that is so much higher than like the average VC backf founder is now like the game you're playing like it's ch what they're doing traditionally is Child's Play In what in comparison to what you're doing right and I mean that's a that's a bonus business idea right there you make a list of all the VC firms and specifically I mean you start with Enterprise B2B ones and then you make the pitch that their Founders need to be media companies and their businesses need to be media companies and you try to sell it to them as a value add to their portfolio hey we come in and we'll we'll we'll create content we'll create videos we'll you know do thumbnails we'll do titles like all the stuff that we talked about on this pod but it's going to cost and your customer isn't the founder it's it's the people who raed fun 100% 100% also every VC you talk to wants to be famous every single one of they all get Envy on this [ __ ] like this is something we learned at Rupa I was just I killed me I thought it was so funny like we grew their Instagram from like zero to like 50,000 followers in like I think it was like sixish months and all I was doing was like we were basically repurposing quotes from the podcast into like those like quote tweets right that were like stylized in a brand format and we were just running Instagram only ads with like follow this account for more content like this to like all of Instagram basically but the the account just grew you know exponentially because it was interesting like the like it's Health it's interesting Health stuff and what that turned into is like VCS were then reaching out to the founder Tara and they were like yo how are you doing this what is going on and because they're all trying to accomplish this as well so I mean you could probably go sell this to them too where it's like yo well like it's like you know L interviews that make cool viral moments happen and like there's like a story arc that happens in it because I think that's a lot of what people don't know how to do is like how do I make this compelling story that is actually going to get reach on the platform right that's this whole other component of it so yeah I mean 100% I think there there's a whole business in there just like making these people famous and selling it Downstream to them through you know whoever just wrote a check into them I actually think the better idea is your idea like selling selling to them and because they they could easily write that off as an expense because it's it's deal flow right they're in the business of getting the best possible deals and they need attention and audience to to do that that's why th% people forget but in Tech in Tech Twitter in the beginning the people who had the most amount of followers weren't the entrepreneurs it was the VCS totally like the Fred Wilson's and you know all those guys use it as magnet content yep yes exactly and use it as magnet content to get inbound of the best Founders in the world right so if you do long form content for them and you basically create this you know basic you're making a fishnet to get the best people like the ideas that they're trying to convey out globally I mean then they create inbound you know the inbound volume and to your point like you probably the price you could charge a Founder you can probably charge 4X that to a VC if you actually can like ship on it and prove that you do this which is crazy to even think about but I think they're thinking about this like I mean every I feel like in the last six months I've seen every you know TI VC firms spin out some type of podcast and like all of them are getting like 30 views on YouTube right now you came in you're like yo I'm gonna like help you do this and I think you actually how you're doing it right now Greg is really interesting where you you mix in the long form uh like YouTube like or sorry um like almost podcast content with like the shorter form like 10-minute like it's like a V you know a classic YouTube video so that classic YouTube video is getting the growth to happen and it's kind of like a top of funnel entry into the channel which creates like a you know that initial initial touch point and then as they get further down the funnel and start to binge then they get into the long form content which creates this long-term deeper relationship which makes them more buyer ready for the product right and so I think that that model just take that same idea and then apply it like you know to the VC again another company that is probably easily a 10 million year dollar company if you can figure out how to execute on it I love it all right man what else you got for us or I think we're at idea number I mean I'm not even going to count those bonus ideas but I think we're at idea number seven right yeah I think we're at seven this one would be quick it's kind of it's more of a tool than anything but it's software so um canva doesn't have good video captions right now where it's like you basically imagine I upload a video into it and I just like want it to caption just like all you know whatever doe premere or any of these other tools um if you built an app and there's some apps in this space but again they're not super good but I think there's an opportunity to go and build this um and it's like based off a search volume that I'm seeing people are definitely searching for it canva is like one of the biggest tools it's one of the fastest growing video editors it's insane when you look at it it's actually nuts and all the all this is is you would basically like they put a video imagine you put a video into it there's like an app section that's in the bottom left hand corner they click it it's like caption this video it transcribes it just use like a large whisper model and then that gets added and you have like a you know you basically can tap into the font Styles that's already built into canva and then add some different variations with like karaoke Etc but I think I think this is like a you know a cool 20K a month type company that's using the distribution if not bigger that's using the distribution of canva um I know I have friends that have done this for like plugins for Adobe Premiere and uh like all of these other kind of like larger tools that more traditional uh uh like video editing softwares um but why is like V beating canva right now it's because it has stuff like this like go and just really you could probably just go build what V has had like V has built and if you clone that into canva and then just like offer that as like a suite like you would basically I mean there's probably an acquisition strategy there as well because it's like okay okay canva doesn't have to go build this they just basically just acquire it and you know they roll it out to their whole their whole group but anyway yeah just I I something we I stumbled upon and um through swell like just people were you know talking about it and I was like oh this is like a very interesting small little tool thing that is probably a great little company that could be run yeah so I was thinking the same thing you get to 20K a month and then what you do is then you you T you take like 20K of your profit and you spend it on PR and you and you just get into like Tech Crunch and and all these places and that's when you reach out to canva and you're and you're like tuck tuck tuck here's all these articles about us we're doing 20K a month you know we love what you're doing we want to be a part of the mission you know is there an opportunity to talk about m&a and then you sell it to them you know at some totally you know and that's what you do you and and and that's that's the playbook for that one so I like that idea uh it's one of those sneaky small ones that could be big totally yeah and the next one another sneaky small one um yeah so do you remember Scott cheap flights I remember when it first came out I was like you know and I was I was turning credit cards for points I you know I still do it to this day just because it's fun it's like more like a hobby type thing but I remember when it came out I was like this is so legit it's sick it's now going or something stupid and it's just evolved into this like just bohemuth that you know it's just it's lost all all flavor right um so I think that there's this opportunity to resurrect that business idea and I think there's a really low code version of this that you can do so Google flights you can now go select a city as like your home City and you can turn on alerts on Google flights to like every city in the world and what then happens is at any time in the future that a price between those cities that you've set up drops like dramatically you get an email from Google automatically it's like hey like you're trying to fly to Dublin like the price is 350 right now and like that's you just get like I you know I've done this where imagine like you get 10 different emails a day of like any place that you're trying to go to right so what I imagine this as a business could be is like you say okay cool I go on Facebook I Target people that have like a um frequent traveler interest on Facebook this is a category and interest group that you can Target you then run ads to those people that's like fine cheap flights from Denver to anywhere and you send them to a newsletter and then that newsletter is all it's doing is it's aggravating the Google flights that are coming in and it's just put putting those into uh uh like this larger newsletter and then you like monetization is charge of subscription you can probably get a kickback on those uh as well like I know kiwi has an affiliate program that you can do but then you know don't just do that for one city do that for like all the major metros in the US and this is this like super low code thing that you could do with probably just like a zapier setup that could honestly in my opinion like that again another easy like 20K a month company that you could build and at all those people that you get onto the email they'll they'll forward that email with all of the flights to their friends and that's how that list grows like organically as time goes on so get another just like small random one that if I was like 20 this is this is what I would go do because I think it would be fun I honestly wouldn't build this because I just think it would be super fun but here's what I would do in in in in this space because I think you're on to something you're right that uh Scotch cheap flights has no soul anymore in fact it was rebranded to going.com which come on that's like there's no soul to that name versus Scott she flights like I connect with that so I I was doing some a little bit of research and I found out that there's a Canadian version of Scott cheap flights what's called sh my screen real it's called so the the holding company is called I think why deals and so what they do which is really smart is they own for all the different Canadian cities they have so the the uh airport in Montreal is Yul so they own yld deals.com and Toronto is YYZ so they own YYZ deals.com super smart but if you look at the website like 1998 Vibes and the guy claims that there's millions of Canadians that are subscribed so this there's an opportunity to you know reach out to someone like this and be like how much cuz doesn't feel like he's I mean literally like there's images of like travel 2000 and just Toronto to Iceland like it it looks like a oh my god dude this amazing look has it totally has Craigslist Vibes it's Craigslist Vibes and whenever you see Craigslist Vibes you know they're printing money no you know it you know it they don't need to change anything they've got something that's working working and uh there's probably an opportunity there and if there isn't an opportunity to buy it I think you can just clone a similar version and just bring it into 2024 what's insane is they're not even ranking for like a ton of keywords so it must just be like they literally have a massive list that they're just every deal goes out through that people don't realize too like you get crazy kick kickbacks from these airline companies if you sell to them as well like why did Google spin up Google flights like that is the reason they're yeah basically an affiliate is what it's turned into right which is a huge item line if you actually look at their pnl it's super interesting but I again I think that it there's I love I love ideas where it's like it happened before and it's like now eroded to now where like its current version is just terrible and how do you just like do that same idea over and over again like and that's really what the internet feels like anymore it's like if you go through enough Cycles you just see the same [ __ ] happening like I'm dying right now watching this younger generation like go through the whole pickup artist and like how do I make money on the internet through an agency like how to build it you know they in these Discord channels like here's how to build a Twitter DM agency and make you know tens of thousands put a rly on your wrist from your parents basement like that type of thing and it's like man this just literally feels like what Tim Harris was Hawking like earlier on when we were all you know in that that beginning stage so anyway yeah like the the great thing about this too is it's already validated you know these you know that people want this and this can exist it's now just okay what's the execution piece but I think just like a simple newsletter like you just build this on top of beehive right yeah and all this turns into is like each location has a newsletter I mean the other side of it too is you probably I mean you could probably go sell the like that whole like if you had you know 50 of the top cities in the US and they all have a list and each list has 20,000 people on it like that is not a small number right and you could probably go and just flip that to like a larger media org um so I don't know just another another random thing espec on the tourism side which is like a huge play like everybody is you know anything travel related is typically a really high uh CPM that you can you can you can sell to that so absolutely and then you can you can you know if you have these lists 20,000 50,000 75,000 you can also do like okay now we're going to do a weekly here's what's happening in my city newsletter th you can create different newsletters off that foundational newsletter so it's like come come for the deals and stay for like local news so I think there's there's a lot of opportunity here I think it's it's a sneaky big idea too um and then yeah you you it's about getting the right domains like I don't know LGA LaGuardia you know LaGuardia deals.com or something like that um and also it even if those are taken in the US and Canada there's also other countries you know think think more globally and so there's a lot of opportunity in this one I like it a lot all right we promised people nine official ideas but you actually had eight on your list I'm going to give not that I feel bad by the way because we gave like a bonus like three or four but I'm gonna give one more uh I have a I have a notes file with all my ideas and I add I don't know two or three ideas per week that just come to me and I just I just pulled it up and I'm gonna I'm gonna bring up the latest idea and I'm curious you're your I'll just give it away screw it so did you see this Finn final Loop no what is it so finalo just raised $35 million in series a funding which I didn't even know like series a funding 35 million no that's like yeah you know a typical series a is like 5 to 10 million so it's it's a massive something is working um and basically what it is is uh e-commerce accounting software and service that never slows you down so it's realtime bookkeeping for D Toc multi Channel on wholesale so they've they've taken something which is basically QuickBooks which we've talked about in the past oh God and they've niched it down to uh DC and Ecom I love it and I think the old so we use a uh lay checkout uses a service called bench okay bench.co um this is the old way of of creating a startup it's kind of like we're you know Cloud bookkeeping and it's going to be like 300 bucks a month and we're gonna it's going to be great but it doesn't speak to anyone right it doesn't speak to SAS it doesn't speak to crypto startups it doesn't speak to too broad it's too broad so here's my idea my idea is what what could what what okay the idea is QuickBooks for X yeah now what are those different categories I don't know um they're probably something like QuickBooks for SAS QuickBooks for agencies real estate real estate you know what you could do is you could go to the QuickBooks extensions and just look what everybody's trying to intergrate with them and that will give you all the industries that are related to it and then just look at the biggest categories and from there you could assess okay cool this is going to be you know there's a huge category that people are trying to connect their Quickbooks data into I'm just thinking about the real estate one because like I know there's a platform that's like which is hilarious it's like a platform that's built for tax and account for Real Estate that people are trying to get into QuickBooks for their accountant um but I mean that that's probably how I'd go about this of assessing like which one of them is the biggest Market opportunity and then you just go and build build that out but would you focus only on internet businesses or would you try to go for like more traditional my my hunch is that for for internet businesses there's probably a lot of competition so I would probably go towards like non you know like I wouldn't go to I I wouldn't start with SAS I bet you there's something maybe a little bit similar nonprofits this is what you do 4,400 searches a month how I'd start this is i' would list out like I think your QuickBooks idea is really smart just like look at the extensions I think i' I would write in a list what what are all the different categories based on that and based and by prompting chat gbt and then I would say and then I would go look for competition I would say like what what is the competition I'd put that in my Google sheet and i' and then I'd say I I'm not going after something with a lot of competition I'm just not interested at this stage of my life I'm just not interested in going after you know companies that have raised hundreds or if not billions of dollars so totally and then I'd pick I'd pick one based on you know is it a growing trend is it you know does it have low competition well like I think an to give a concrete examp example of this it would be like QuickBooks for like Airbnb entrepreneurs or whatever like something like that where it's like you know it's a larger wave that's happening and there's businesses that are being built on top of it I would just look at these platforms because like really D Toc is kind of that right like they're all kind of built on top of Shopify so it's like find that version of that in these other spaces like what's a bigger thing that's happening and then just like build a custom that's super interesting um this is happening in the EHR space like in the health world where it's like you used to have like this Mass massive you know single EHR that everybody would use you know I think one of them is epic.com I think is the name of it or epic is the biggest one they Lobby so much it's insane do not build an EHR just full stop do not build this like if you're listening right now never even think about this idea never approach it there's no way you can win you're fighting the government um so the I think the bigger thing here though is that people basically spun out like ehrs that were specific for all of these different practitioner types and you could basically it's that same idea of like okay how do I take this like larger thing and then just the Craigslist untangling in a different space right but do it for accounting it's all the same ideas just remixed in different places so but yeah man I I think that's super interesting of just like you know even the nonprofits thing all all those people are super easy to contact as well like like final loop as an example like what they're probably doing for growth is they're just cold emailing every Shopify owner and being like yo we we built a custom you know uh taxes integration for for it just plugs into your Shopify and it runs on the back end or whatever your your you know the system is that they're using for uh there's like skew management and all that P all that but I don't know I think uh I think the bit the the play here is always just like going back to like where what is a bigger platform that people are doing or like using or a B some type of business category that you can then go and build that custom solution for so that's it man that's it that's plus a bunch of bonus ideas Cody Schneider how you feeling about this episode dude I feel good I think the first one had the energy you know like people are going to get tired of me real quick and so that is uh we're trying to bring trying to bring the sauce every time I think the the bigger thing here that I'm like always I I want to talk more the next time we do this on like what like here's the actual tactical components of this of how to go mark because I can say like go email every Shopify person but like what I'm really saying is like go to Apollo and you scrape every person that's using Shopify out of Apollo and you go and you validate those emails with zero bounce and then you set up a smart lead campaign and you basically are cold emailing every one of them that like yo we do this this this type of service this software right so like the actual tactical components of that I think that that's like a piece of this as well because like the idea is fine but unless you got the distribution part of it and I think that's why the Cricut one was such a bit like a banger thing so anyways I'm going to hold myself to that on the next one is like with everything we talk about it's like what's the what's the TA itical distribution that we're going on and go really deep and heavy on those pieces but yeah cool so on YouTube comment if if you want to see that from Cody I know you want to see it and uh don't forget to subscribe on YouTube and also to follow what if you're listening on Spotify or you're listening on Apple podcast don't forget to follow because then then you'll know when Cody comes back on so appreciate it Cody thank you so much uh people can find you on Twitter yeah Twitter and Linkedin are my most active and then the company I'm building right now is swell AI we're doing basically content repurposing powered by ai go take a look and be stoked to have you so thanks again J always so fun man I live for these things they're awesome yeah I love when you get just so excited about an idea like halfway through and I just see your brain just like it's like you're a kid getting really exciting totally you love it I love it I love it it's a compulsion like it's 100% like can't not think it's just for some reason it's like the puzzle piece I just get the dopamine hit right when it's like yo we like here's this thing and like here's you know these people that want that thing like what's the bridge that we can build to do that like I that that is the thing I live for is like that whole that bridge building piece right um it's funny like because I'm not a long term I don't I I don't want to do ops right like I want to figure out the puzzles and hand them off to people that are you know can ship on them and just do that over and over again run that process I love building the process and that whole piece you know it's kind of that Orchestra conversation that we were talking about but uh when we do this it's just like you know it's junk food for me right because it's it's like here's this idea how would you how would you actually grow it and then it's like boom here's all these tools in the tool belt that we can tactically you know go to deploy and it's the same playbooks over and over again I think that's the thing that like a lot of people don't realize with this stuff is like everything is exactly the same from a growth standpoint it's just different tweaks that are happening and you know it's only 10% that we're changing to the core you know distribution idea so totally yeah I think you know it's it's like a few Frameworks it's like okay this idea Works how do we bring it to another G Geography okay this is a trend here that's underserved it's just and that's that's why I love going through a bunch of ideas is because you're hearing okay you're you're you're starting it's starting to get into you okay this is how I would approach the problem it's not this specific idea that I want to take it's just in general this is how I could if I come up with an idea this is how and Cody would come you know would actually create create something like this 100% 100% it also is again like this at bats thing like it gets me more at bats like when I can hear from your perspective of how you would approach like okay how do I grow this company and that just creates this like I don't know you connect all these thoughts and ideas together right that you otherwise like that synthesis happens when you think through these from like other people's perspectives and then you can go and like apply that to the you know whatever it is that you're building currently so that's this whole other mechanism I mean it's what's is like I know you and I probably have I don't know 10 of these conversations a week or five of these conversations a week only one of them is recorded right like this episode but like I I have founder friends that I talk to like on a weekly basis where it's like yo I'm seeing this what are you seeing this is working this isn't that type of thing right and all I'm trying to do is just more at bats more looks at pitches so that when I come up to the plate it's like I have you know more knowledge of what how the pitcher's throwing Etc right or whatever and you know to that that is really the the value of this all we're doing is just taking those conversations and putting them in public and that that same idea can be applied in any industry this is what kills me right it's like this is every industry that you're trying to like build a company in you can just literally just have these conversations that you're already having put them out in public and you will get followership through that and build reputation and build knowledge and like also just build leverage through that that piece of media that you build and it could be super small like something that's like super Niche like I have a friend that all he talks about is like digital out of home advertising right but has like one of the biggest podcasts in this space and like he gets invited to these like events like with media buyers and he just talks about the trends he's seeing based off the conversations that he's having and like again that looks like nothing from the outside but he makes a great living doing that right so anyway just another another way to think about it totally and you don't need that many followers for it to be super impactful like I know guys girls whatever who have five 10,000 followers are making millions of dollars a year from that uh from that group it's just the right amount of followers with it's it's not the right amount of followers it's it's the right followers it's about attracting the right people and it opens doors um you know the way we met is kind of funny which is you probably had like five or 10 thousand followers on Twitter and I was following you because you were you were a real one you were actually putting out this is how I'd grow this thing and I was like oh man in a world where where where Twitter is just like so sterile and manufactured it felt so amazing to see what you were putting out there and I would basically feature you in my newsletter with like has you know 75,000 Subs every single week so funny right and I think the first thing I said to you is like my grandma put me back in the whe because you put me in your newsletter or something like that that was the cold open yeah it was and I was like I like this guy I like this guy but that is the bigger Trend right like an easy way for people to think about this is like look at a physician or a doctor like traditionally all of that knowledge used to be trapped behind them then the internet came and like now it's all in public and so the authority that they had The Gatekeepers ship that they had was eliminated through that process with that said though then these people saw this and they're like actually all this knowledge is pretty terrible and that's why you see like the huberman and you know the Peter Tia and all all these people in the health categories come out and own these categories that are talking about these things that aren't in kind of the general knowledge that exists online right it it's that same concept here like if you just like UNG gatekeep what used to be gatekeep like you will get people that are interested in that same thing to just start reaching out to you and that's just the natural effect that happens when you do that and it's it's it's not complicated it's just like but a lot of the times like again I'm anti-c course because I I just won't do it like I think that teaching is like a public service right like I'm on here because this is St you know State mandated by my parole officer like I have to be talking to you right now because they require me to share this information no but in all reality like this is just a way to talk about this stuff in a public setting that I had mentorship that you know there's no way I I shouldn't be where I'm at unless I had you know I wouldn't be where I'm at unless I had that I was I worked for this dude that just basically taught me like how to do all this stuff right and and you feel this almost as obligation to but what happens the knock on effect is when you put all this out there in public then suddenly you just start to get inbounded like you reaching out to me or you know stuff like that where it's like it wouldn't it otherwise wouldn't happen right and and that bigger media play is that game here that's the whole the whole strategy behind this and like really that's just another business like pick pick a category you're in like I was just talk another friend that's in the Supply Chain management uh space she SP up a podcast like now one of the leading voices in it this was like two years ago she did this and dude she's making a great living and again like all she's doing is it's super niched down there's maybe 10,000 people that listen to it that's the whole audience but they have so much buying power and it's so under service like we're talking about this LinkedIn thing with like you know there's like video content there's a it's blue ocean there well look for all these spaces that are like unsexy and where blue ocean exists and if you just build media there you can build companies on top of that and like whatever that is whether it's consulting or service businesses Etc and honestly that's all these podcasts are turning into more and more is like it's just a sales tool it's just sales and disguise right like Greg and I have a trench code on like he's sitting on my shoulders and we're just like using this platform to basically talk about this stuff that like we know is junk food that we know majority of people won't go and actually do but in reality like what's going to happen from this is like it's going to create all this inbound you know volume that will go down into the things and the companies that we're building and that's what you know the the byproduct of doing this in a public setting does I mean also you know I think a bunch of people listen to this podcast and just it's entertainment for them it's like watching Shark Tank so totally I think there's that but I also think that there's a sub there is a group of people who listen to this podcast like the SVG Collective guy or collections guy who are like wow I never thought of that I'm gonna go and do this thing and it's going to be a success and when it's a success he's going to reach I mean he reached out to us already but he's going to reach out to us and he's going to be like thank you Cody like you changed my life and and I won't forget that and then he's going to start his own podcast and he's going to you know pay it back and so it does you know that's that's also just a cool part about doing this totally 100% And it's like I think that thing way I think about it more and more is like I'm just trying to create as much surface area as possible to create like greater Serendipity it's like one of the best quotes and like the easiest way to do that is build media and just be everywhere and it just from that you just create yeah I talk about this all the time but it's like I'm trying to create digital gravity right like for Brands and for self and for all of this it's just as much digital Mass on the internet as possible to create as much D digital gravity as you can as possible and this is another vehicle for that so and and one one thing that I've learned is be yourself you know when I when I first started podcasting I wasn't myself really and it was only recently where I was like you know I'm just going to how has that changed just I'll give you an example people you know people say that uh I talk slowly or I have a calm voice so what I would do is I'd counteract that and I would be like I try to put my Gary V hat on you know and try to get super and it's just it's not me they're like oh [ __ ] this guy have you seen that Meme and it's like Gary ve showing up to your yard sale it's like they're like oh [ __ ] not him again and he's just like bartering with them on like [ __ ] Hot Wheels and they're like God damn it just get out of here like I love that so much so good yeah I was someone who you know I really wasn't and the reason I did that is because I was like oh these are best practices therefore I need to do it as soon as I started being myself and also another part of that is talking about what I want to talk about which is startup ideas even though the best people in the world told me that's too Niche the best podcasters when I when I pitch this idea originally they they're like to Niche and as soon as they said that I was like I'm on I I'm G to be on to something and and you know what there there's people who are listening to this who are going to be like I wish you would talk faster I wish you did have more energy I wish you did these and it's like okay well you're you know you're listening to me you're listening to Cody cuz you like us presumably and you find you're that person hate listening this deep into this I'm so proud of you I want that energy yeah it's like what are you doing it's an hour plus deep and it's like why are you listening to us th% you don't like us that's when you know you actually made it though I love this quote it was from this uh this Runner I can't remember her name but she's like she's like if somebody doesn't hate you like you aren't even in the game it's like I think that that's so true like if you don't like if you're not even playing you're not at the at the highest level unless there's like a subset of people that just despise Your Existence so um and you know what's exhausting being someone who you're not is exhausting th% man it's just a character at that point like you know being Tucker Carlson you have to play that dude I don't think he believes any of that [ __ ] the zins piece that's he's for sure he's on I I think he's aligned on the zins but everything else it's like you know this is this character you're playing but man I think it's interesting though like you also have to think about about it like you want to bring these differing uh like it's like different tempos like that's actually what good writing is is it's like the you know it's it's that uh I think they call it perplexity and burstiness and it's like you're like short sentence long one you know short short long one it's like creating this kind of like variety and that's like one language like oration when you look at it like that's the how it's like the composition of it and why it sounds good and it moves us Etc it's like music right it's like it actually is music and I think when you have this variety of people on you create like it's like different you know almost rhythms that are happening and different pacing you're the Baseline that's just constantly going and like for you I feel like from the you know outside looking in it's like okay how do I bring these like ridiculous almost like again manic like people onto the show that are like they're going to play the solos or whatever on this top level and then I just get the Baseline this whole time which is like it creates this really interesting composition right so anyway yeah I just I makes sense also the the kills me that people told you that and I probably know who these people are that said that this was a bad idea but I'm over here and I'm like this is the best business move that's happened in 2023 2024 thousand like zero doubt like people live for this this there's a vacuum in this space right now all the people that were in this space have leveled up and they're now like we want to talk to billionaires and that [ __ ] and that's like this not accessible right it's like Kanye talking about like you know private jets after he does uh like 808 and heartre or heart or heartbreaks right he it'ss like oh like you're talking about like just getting a whip so that women's like you and then now you're talking about Jets like I that that leap I can't even make I can't even like fathom or think and I think that this thing that you're doing it's like you're you're riding that common de nominator of like you know the 200 million people that want to start a company but there's only whatever it is it's like 10 million that actually have right like you get to service that whole group of people so again I me we could talk about this all day from a strategy and a standpoint but I just think it's just like a no-brainer from the outside looking in it looks ridiculous so um all right we got to run we got to run this has been great Cody thanks again for coming on uh also you need to sh you also need to shave we're doing a live stream man what was it so we're gonna get we're gonna give you a mullet is that what's happening yeah I'm gonna the next live stream we I'll get a mullet and I'll shave my beard mustache only is kind of what I'm thinking and uh we'll just do it live we'll like while while we're talking to Founders and giving them advice uh just have that going on in the background just like this haircut thing so I'm I'm in we're there we can Pro probably needs to be this weekend if we do it but I don't know when the next next time I know you're traveling right now so we'll figure it out oh I'll do anything for for Cody Schneider mullet so we'll figure it out we got it all right dude C you later later G thanks for having me [Music] baby

here's where I think service-based businesses are going to go when you build a service-based business think of like a design agency or um an SEO shop or something like that number one you start with humans doing the work and then number two you transition from humans doing 100% of the work to AI assisted human work and then step three you transition to agents do all the work once you get to step three the margins are going to 3 four 5x instead of making 20% IA you might be able to make 60% IA 80% IA and the reason why is because you're paying tokens and you're getting agents to do the work and and this might be in five years and this might be in seven years or three years but the point is if they can get there and you've built up all the systems and processes and client base then you're going to be in a really really good place so that [Music] and we're back another solo pod just me I'm going to give away some ideas some Trends I did one of these last week and and you all loved it so I figured I'd do another one let's get right into it so I want to start off with the trend and I'll give you some ideas for this trend so recently I got married and my wedding was different than most people's wedding most a lot of people have weddings and they've got a hundred of their closest friends and families there uh I had a wedding and there was 14 people there and and that was including me and my wife so weddings are changing you know people don't want to spend thousands of dollars on weddings they want to do something small they want to do something intimate and that leads me to my my trend of the week which is micro weddings so what is is a micro wedding I think we need to just Define it so it basically means a wedding with less than 50 people it's just way more intimate and uh it's especially big in places like New York La Miami where the cost per wedding guest could be more than $1,000 per guest so it's absolutely out of control this is obviously due to inflation and over the LA you know over the last few years it's just it just gotten out of hand so okay so this is the trend I think a lot of you are probably you know nodding your head and being like of course this makes a lot of sense how can I create a business on top of this trend so idea number one is just leaden so uh there's a bunch of small venues that haven't uh they're not really set up for micro weddings and the biggest challenge of that is you know these these small venues are uh don't have the the visibility they have smaller marketing budgets um and then they probably just don't know that this trend is happening so you could go and just bridge the gap so um you know I just Googled here micro wedding Los Angeles um and I saw that there was actually a sponsored link called intimat Mountain weddings.com so great domain good SEO um and as the search volume starts to increase if people become aware that micro wedding is a thing uh traffic's going to go you know go up so how can you operate this idea as a service so you know step one is you just got to form the Partnerships agreement so you go to these wedding venues uh and you basically say hey I'm going to send you a bunch of leads for for for your micro wedding and then would you know would you be willing to give me 10% 5% 20% of a booking that's made through your platform so it's like a win-win situation uh for for the small venue a lot of these venues they're hanging on by a thread they want they want more Revenue uh then you're going to step two is just to implement SEO and and advertising so you're going to generate uh traffic mostly by um mostly by search so the the BET here is that uh you know more and more people are going to search it you're going to show up uh and then you could obviously uh do a little bit of AD Arbitrage what is AD Arbitrage that just basically means when you know you're spending $2 a click but the average click gives you $3 you create this vending machine where you put $2 in $3 comes out so uh that's that's where you're going to mainly focus of course you can do content and building an audience around it and and just showcase these venues and showcase other weddings uh that's definitely a given so I would say Implement SEO advertising and and build an audience uh and then step three is uh specialize in promote so you know I would say become the micro wedding Market gal or guy um you know once you uh once you position yourself as that person I and I think that's ripe for the taking um you're you're going to earn more trust and you know the hard part about uh something like this is it is a new market and whenever you have a new market you have to educate people why this should exist everyone knows oh just got engaged I need to go and create a wedding but they don't know about the concept of a micro wedding what that is why it's better why it's going to save you money and why if you forget all the money it's just going to be a more intimate experience for the people that you love um so you know I think that there's tons of opportunity to to own that uh to own that category and uh I I you know this is just like like one of those lowrisk ideas so idea number two in the micro wedding space um is just uh helping helping plan so um you know offering comprehensive all-inclusive micro wedding packages that streamline the entire planning process so uh I found this Reddit post so here's the here's the the post micro wedding in Southern California LA County 13 guests 23,000 and they basically just go into this this is a long one for those interested in the numbers um they talk about how the original uh wedding was supposed to take place in June 2020 uh but obviously because of covid they couldn't do it they talk about how much they paid in their Deposit they talked about the C you know the ceremon the basically the budget breakdown so ceremony venue $22,000 dinner venue 3500 partial uh partial planner 1500 uh I guess it's a party planner but only partial which is kind of an interesting that's a whole other Niche to own uh like another idea right there is you know like a fractional you know partial party planner photographer 3100 videographer ,000 string Trio $800 florals $1,500 anyways you get the idea bottom line is it's $3,386 which obviously is a lot of money but isn't $100,000 um or isn't you know some people spend a million dollars um so they just go into this and you can see you know they talk about everything about and they break this all down this is an incredible content piece I would love to see um you know you could create a whole audience around breaking down different micro weddings and then if you look in the comment section on Reddit people are just so engaged they're so appreciative of of it hey everyone if you're anything like me you've got a ton of design work that you need websites landing pages emails social assets you name it but you don't just want beautiful landing pages or beautiful websites you want the stuff that's going to convert you want the stuff that's going to actually drive value that's where design scientist.com comes in it's an agency that for one monthly price will do all your design work all your copy work all your engineering and do stuff that actually Tails your Revenue you don't need a designer you need a design scientist let's go design scientist.com I liked it so much I invested in the business I use I like to use Reddit and see posts that you know go viral in particular communities as a way to validate uh a particular business idea so I see this and I'm like okay there's something here in the micro wedding space because they put it in the uh wedding planning uh subreddit which has 829 th000 members um and it and it went viral within that community so you know one thing you could do is you can create the subreddit for micro wedings you can be that moderator so that's just an idea for you okay let's get back to uh the idea so so the idea is basically to create an agency a wedding planning agency but only focus on micro weddings and there's Oney that I was able to find that's doing it and it's called Uh our little wedding and I found it via that Reddit post they're based in San Francisco uh you you can tell uh you know there's basically a coming soon version of their website so it's not exactly optimized but you get the idea uh there's these all-inclusive micro weddings that they sell and it's you know between 5 and $6,100 $5,000 $6,100 so uh here's one the Bay Area redwoods elopment so it's an all-inclusive uh package $5,000 you get a mil Valley Amphitheater private ceremony 1 hour photography personal floral florals you get a dinner a luxury reception dinner celebration uh cake and cake florals and you get add up to six guests so you get this beautiful background super picturesque uh Instagram friendly and it's beautiful it's intimate and it's $5,000 so this is the type of thing that you can go and create idea number two is you just go and uh organize these packages build Brands around it and capitalize on the micro wedding uh Trend so that's my trend of the week micro weddings uh I I love it for a lot of reasons like I mentioned the red you know validated on red offshoot of a particular sub of a particular subreddit uh you're starting to see little businesses pop up you can there's so many validated business models you don't need to reinvent the wheel you can do things like a like an agency and then people are willing to spend on their weddings so when you're creating a business you obviously want to prioritize businesses where people are willing to take out their wallet and this is something where people feel like they're saving money you know if they're spending $5,000 on a wedding and they thought that they were going to spend $50,000 uh they're going to be pretty pretty darn happy so um I I love this I love this concept for a lot of reasons and I also think that you know as someone who had a micro wedding I didn't even know it was called a micro wedding but as someone who had a micro wedding it it was just an incredible experience and special in its own way um I feel like you know I'm 35 now and a lot of my friends have gotten un married and it just sort of feels like by by the end of like the last weddings of my friend group it almost felt like all these weddings were the same and they were beautiful weddings and great places and beautiful hotels um but they all had the 100 200 300 people they all had the same band they all had the same sort of food and I think this idea around micro weddings that are just also just unique experience like imagine getting married in in the Sequoia North of San Francisco all these trees that they're hundreds of years old and they're they're as tall as skyscrapers like how cool is that so love this trend and uh wanted to give it to you the other thing that I wanted to talk about is just a Insight I had around building businesses that are powered by human beings and when I'm talking about building businesses I'm talking about service-based businesses here's where I think service-based businesses are going to go so when you build a service based business think of like a design agency or um an SEO shop or something like that you start with number one you start with humans doing the work and then number two it's you transition from humans doing 100% of the work to AI assisted human work and then step three you transition to agents do all the work and I think this is just an interesting framework and something I'm just thinking about and I wanted to share it with you around what are businesses that are going to translate into that framework because I think that once you get to step three the margins are going to 3 four 5x instead of making 20% IA you might be able to make 60% IA 80% iita and the reason why is because you're paying tokens and you're getting agents to do the work and people are expensive there are certain industries where this probably won't happen you know we run an innovation design agency called LCA and you know we work with the Nikes and the dropboxes and the Shopify of the world and these large companies with the you know with their executive team and they don't want AI to do all the work and they also need someone to talk to and they need someone to brainstorm with and they need someone to jam with so are certain spaces where where it doesn't make sense um but there are certain spaces where it does make sense and I think that's sort of my homework for you and something to think about is what are what are service-based businesses that are most likely going to hit that number three get basically get agents on board and and this might be in 5 years and this might be in seven years or three years but the point is if they can get there and you you've built up all the systems and processes and client base you know in five years then you're going to be in a really really good place so that's something that I've been thinking about and the last thing I want to talk about today is I've been doing these live streams where I've been bringing people on stage who have startup ideas who want Fe my feedback and it's been really really fun uh and also people who just have a business and they're past the idea stage like they've got something live and they want my feedback so I'm going to share with you a couple couple of the ideas that were shared to me that I wasn't able to bring people on stage and I'm going to give I'm going to give live feedback and my hope my hope here is it's going to get your creative juices flowing it's going to help you help you get a bunch of startup ideas and uh so let let's let's let's get right into it so Peter gray messaged me and says here's the idea it's called more than Academy it's an athlete tailored entrepreneurial education startup there will be online community networking Master Class Type videos more formal LinkedIn type online courses for certificates and badges and an in-person Workshop primary series targeting at high school athletes with aspirations of being an athlete aimed at empowering student athletes well it's a lot of athletes with the skills and mindset needed for both athletic and entrepreneurial success the person worksh shops lead genen for the online community and online education our business would then lead genen potential clients for all the nil agencies or organizations like athletes. org okay so uh I'm I'm not going to give you specific feedback on do athletes or aspiring athletes need this I think they probably do but I'm not one myself so you would know better than me but I'll give you feedback and give everyone feedback on a really big opportunity which is credential isation we're living in a world where the value of a Harvard degree and a Standford degree and is going down of course you know it's valuable I'm not I'm not going to say it's not but in our world our world of like Twitter podcast YouTube um what people really care about is what have you done you know have your has your content gone viral in your Niche and and that's basically it and and are you an interesting cool person that I want to work with that's what people care about that being said getting in the front door is is difficult today it's probably even more difficult today than it was 10 years ago and I think the good part of having a Stanford degree or Harvard degree is it gets you in the front door I think that there's tons of opportunity to build online programs and IRL programs that credential lies so and what do I mean by credential credential IES I mean you get a certificate and people will pay for that certificate so I saw this really good tweet by Peter levels uh on Twitter and he goes if you're looking for a remote job go Learn Python and apply for jobs in AI python is the fastest growing and highest paid for remote jobs right now the median salary is $880,000 a year for remote but with massive outliers into $300,000 a year and higher if you go non- remote usually in office in San Francisco so then he's put this this chart of basically the fastest growing and highest paying jobs in 2024 python marketing node backend typescript sales Ruby react non non-tech JavaScript customer support I would basically use chap GPT to to build this list um or you can even grab this list we can put it in the show notes um but I would basically create a list and then I would be like how do I credential eyesee for python how do I you know credential eyesee for not marketing because marketing is too it's too big but what about you know growth marketing um so how how you'd actually go and build out this idea is you know you you take out a piece of paper you you'd write in the middle Hub and spoke The Hub would be marketing and what are the spokes growth marketing PPC um you know audience development uh video content what are all the ways that people Market in 2024 and then I'd look at credentialing and the other way you can create this business uh is you can actually go to existing course creators and be like hey I'm going to manage the credential isation of your program I'm going to manage uh the graduation of your program uh and I'm going to you know send uh I'm just going to make this experience incredible and I think that's another business that uh is would definitely cash flow um you know $10,000 to $100,000 a month so I I I I'm not you know to answer your you know to get to give you feedback Peter I don't know enough about uh athletes but I think uh what you inspired me to think about is credential isation is something that's a huge huge huge idea so I like it a lot and then Jose cillo says I recently started building trip.com it's an analy analytic platform for ux teams I'd love some feedback okay so let's bring up trip.com and give and give him some feedback okay so I pulled it up says analytics for ux teams that tracks user task duration and helps you fix user sticking points for smoother task completion discover the true efficiency of your app with realtime insights into task completion times identify and streamline complex workflow to enhance user satisfaction and productivity okay and then there's an image here and then how do they charge so they charge $9.90 $9.99 a month uh and you get five different tasks configure to record uh or 1999 it's they call a business plan uh where you get 10 different tasks so this is one of those ideas that you've built something really smart but the way you're talking about it and way it's positioned could be optimized so it's not just about quote unquote smoother task completion because what does that mean it means if you get people to complete their tasks uh we actually did some research if you get someone to complete uh compete their task their primary task of going onto a mobile app or going onto a website they're actually 67% more likely to buy a product or service from you so if you can tell me that you're going to help me sell more stuff or you're going to help me uh get more people to subscribe or you're going to help me uh get more followers or you're going to help me drive word of mouth all these things like that's what this is about it's not about task completion so the biggest thing that you need here is to reposition around what is what is unpack task completion um and the other thing is you want to when you're writing copy write like you talk you know you would never say in a conversation discover the true efficiency of your app with real-time insights into task completion times so you just need to rewrite your website as if you're talking to an eighth grader and that's something that's a prompt that you can actually put within chat jpt you can say uh you can put in all your copy and then put into chat GPT and you say I really want this to be written in plain English uh can you make this really really clear and catchy for an eighth grader and then you ask it to rewrite it and you're going to get some some some good stuff the other thing is where's the video you know I'm on your website and it's just an image I think that so many people are using images and just text on on web pages I'm really really bullish right now on your you know having above the fold a video and that's going to help increase conversion rates no question show show me what you're doing people are used to Instagram stories they're used to YouTube shorts uh they're watching video everywhere they should be watching video on your website and the beauty is video is one of the best I think if not the best way to because you've got audio you got V uh visual you've got sound so you feel more connected to a product uh via video if it's just an image and last thing is I don't know about your your business model 999 to 1999 like that feels quite arbitrary you know and it feels like if you're actually helping that much with task completion it's worth a lot more than 1999 so that's my feedback and uh hope that was helping all right so that's the Pod if you if you enjoyed it please please go to YouTube subscribe and comment on the YouTube video and I read every comment I respond to most of the comments especially if they're nice and uh I'll see you on the next one hope this got your creative juices flowing later everyone [Music] baby

yeah I mean four or five years ago maybe a little bit longer now gosh was probably is longer now there was a Coachella where Tupac was on stage as a hologram yeah rapping along sides alongside Snoop Dogg and and some other folks um and that was a huge unlock SL wow moment for a lot of people they're like they brought someone back from the dead for a performance it's kind of crazy right A lot has happened since then and now we have you know AI voice models that can be trained on like five words and create like pretty accurate you know voice voices that are that are basically you could take just the five words that I say and then train on my voice and and spit out full paragraphs of of of copy that sound exactly like me and it even gets better if you just train for a few minutes of with data right so there is very much a world where if I'm in my studio here I can put up a green screen for my guest I can um you know create my guest and i' I've seen it even working now where you can actually take and you can lip sync uh or so you can lip I guess it is lip sync you're syncing their lips to what they're saying um they do this for different languages so right now I could be speaking Spanish to you or Japanese and my lips would look like I'm speaking Japanese if you just run it through this post-processing um uh production that's out there uh what I would do is I would say okay let's just take a great flosser like Allan Wat um if you go to Alan watts. org his website you can download 500 hours of his talks right like that an MP3 format again with the training you could go and take all that data and say okay I'm taking that entire Corpus I want to understand who alen wats is his philosophies feed in some of his books as well and all of a sudden you have a pretty interesting you know compelling AI model that will speak and act and talk and think like Alan Watts now I can sit down and in real time have a conversation and interview people that have passed away I could do this with Einstein you could do this with a whole slew of different people and actually you know have fullon conversations and yes the AI is kind of filling in some of the gaps and trying to come up with his best Assumption of how they would answer certain things but if you have enough data I'd imagine you get pretty close I think it would be a fun experiment I don't know there's this is not a business this is just more like a thought experiment like what if we went and tried this to see what would happen I mean you could do this with all different types of leaders both good and bad that have passed away um you know you can imagine some pretty extreme examples of previous leaders that were pretty evil that you could bring in you know their data and thinking and it just um yeah it would just be fascinating to see how this unfolds and I have to imagine it's coming soon what about taking it to the next level with speaking to people in our lives that have passed away oh 100% yeah yeah that that would be the problem there is like just do you have enough data like I have my my dad's passed away you know uh 13 years ago now something like that and I think about what I have of him and I have a few recordings of him saying a few things bunch of emails but they were you know just little two three sentence things here and there so I don't know that I have the data required for that but we certainly will like my kids will be able to do that with me for sure that's for sure yeah that's for sure and I was thinking about this the other day because my dad my dad was like cleaning out a closet and he had found a bunch of DVDs um like old family videos and he sent me he sent me a bunch and I hadn't seen these people like you know as you know my late my late grandfather my other late grandfather I haven't seen them videos moving pictures of them in such a long time um and there's just something about watching someone in video that like you really it hits different than a photo yeah I just it's funny you say that I just got done sending my entire box of old videos uh mostly VHS honestly and getting them converted by company and they sent him to me and I hadn't seen my grandma in you know since she was alive like like almost 30 years ago or something I was a little kid you know I saw her last and just to see her there was in talking was such a trip such a trip and I mean the MVP of this like even if you don't have enough video footage of your grandmother but you knew a few things that she used to say and you have maybe some of her voice like just like good morning Kevin like hope you have a great day um yeah yeah it's it's really it's funny that we were just talking about Alan Watson I saw somebody hacked a Raspberry Pi to be their voice assistant and they used alen watt's training data and it was like totally alen watt saying good morning like you know enjoy your day today you have three meetings or whatever and I was like what the hell like it's so such a trip such a trip and I I just think that I know I personally would pay tons of money for something like that um yeah so I think there's a huge business around that it's sing time baby

I think it's probably a $30 million a year company that just based off of the search volume based off of how many users of Quick Books there are and based off of how many people aren't building these Integrations for this category there's 4,000 keywords for XYZ QuickBooks Integrations this is insane what this is basically is people are trying to get data from other tools into QuickBooks let's just talk through like the biology of this business because I think it's like Madness QuickBooks huge company so you can eat you know their scraps and still make a massive business here they have an app store but there's not a ton of developer developer activity within that App Store so there's a ton of Arbitrage that you can capitalize on now when you look at the actual software that you're going to be building you're just doing a handshake it's an API call from one place into another place you don't even have to store that data you're just moving it back and forth between these platforms when it goes about the marketing strategy basically you could just do SEO and sem and that would be the entire growth strategy for this

a DM on Instagram with your startup idea again could be super Half Baked Jason I'm bringing you I just sent you the link and it's crazy because people have been uh there's been people have taken these live stream ideas and are like building businesses like straight up businesses like the someone is going to listen to this live stream today and take one of these ideas um and and and maybe if they don't take the exact IDE it'll Inspire them to uh to do something and and you know maybe take that idea but build it for a new Niche Cody will probably be coming on later Cody Schneider will be probably coming on all right boom we got our first guest uh first guest of the day Mason are you ready to come on stage I see you there boom Oh I'm ready oh yeah beer me are you kidding me yeah it's it's the wave okay so should I just should I kind of explain what it is get into it what's on your mind okay so me and my buddy we're creating a hoodie right now we have 200 hoodies our first bull quarters on the way but it's essentially a hoodie it says Beery period embroidered on the chest and then right here has a cup holder that convenient conveniently places your beer so then if you're at a party if you're at a bar there's two things one is you can put it there so then you can keep your hands free play games talk with people and it doesn't get moved or or bumped with but also there's kind of a safety aspect of it as well for specifically women they can keep the drink on their chest so there's no risk of it getting uh spiked or anything because it's right there with you um me and my co-founders so far we've gotten 60 pre-orders we've gotten funding from our school for the business um and we're really just looking out ways to kind of make it a reality now uh do you have a website uh no we're actually this week and he's driving up to SF I'm here for an internship and we're going to build it today uh but we have an Instagram shop. beerme um it's got some funny little Instagram reels we're kind of trying to take the we're kind of taking inspiration from liquid death for an unserious just funny marketing that tries to get people to laugh um because that's kind of what the product is in itself um but yeah building the building the website this weekend okay wait I'm gonna sh I'm G to share my screen real quick just give people a little visual of shop. beer me so walk me through what should I what should I press over here uh press the one with the old [Music] guy still [ __ ] got it that was so good I think we got to watch that again [Music] still [ __ ] got it who is that by the way that's uh my co-founder's grandpa okay I just I I just wanted to make sure that no grandpas were hurt no Grandpa's were hurt I love it so good okay so um you want feedback on your idea yeah absolutely okay so I don't know if you know how this works here basically we do these live streams and uh people either sip the idea which means they like it or they spit the idea which means yeah like it so much so on YouTube in the comment section I just want to hear from you do you guys sip or spit this idea just write in the comments on YouTube sip or spit this idea before I give my feedback on is this a viable business do I think this you know could go somewhere shouldn't Mason you know be putting his his his brain somewhere else or do we think this is a viable business and while while people comment on YouTube either SI sip or spit like what's your goal with this yeah it's a good question I think the main goal um is we really want to sell it we think this could be something you could sell to like a bar stool Sports um something like that really scale it so our our main strategy that we're we're taking is we're I go to the University of Oregon in Eugene so the the hoodie that the the grand Pol was wearing was in our ducks colorway we really just want to focus on college students um as well as like dads so release the campus collection colorways for every school if we could get a hoodie um in every major school that's kind of where we're going um and yeah I think the long-term plan is to try to sell it um to to a more established company for a payout and then kind of take that to go into something that's a little bit more long term so get a quad basically is your goal you want you want you know Dave por to be knocking on your door and handing you a $10 million check for something like this pretty much so when I was earlier in my career 18 19 20 21 22 it was all about how do I build something and sell something Acquired and what I realized is there's typically only seven companies and three people at those companies that matter in order for you to sell the company so what are they so you know the three people are generally CEO Chief product officer sometimes it's like a head of product or product manager so your job Mason if you do this idea or not is to get to know that I call it the law of 21 seven time three who are the seven companies make a list this weekend you'll make a list bar stool ex you know all those people times three people CEO Chief product officer maybe product manager and your job is to get to know these 21 people it's to like fly out get to know them be in their inbox become their friends so that when you're ready to sell your business you just send them a text and it's like Dave you know I've been doing this for three years you know we've done some affiliate deals together how do we uh how do we actually sell this thing so that's just that's for anyone listening if you if you're building something to sell do that law of 21 but I think I I got to be real with you this is a spit idea for me okay and and it's a spit idea because there it it you know it's a physical product and I think there's just so much opportunity right now in digital products right now that you know you're making your life harder I think that it's one of those ideas that could go viral but I don't know like you know you you know what is the life cycle of that product and how and how do you sell multiple products you're going to need multiple SKS to make this like a multi-million dollar a year business um so if I were you I would you know I wouldn't be doing this I'm thinking more of like how do I create a cash flow business and maybe do this on the side like maybe this is like kind of a side thing that you can do that is kind of like a slow burner that you know eventually you sell but I think that if I'm you you know I'm thinking about how am I creating cash flowing internet startups you're young you're probably good with a video camera I'm creating video you know it seems like you are and like you get how to make things go viral but it's you know are you you know should you be spending your time on something else okay I appreciate that can I kind of give you some some perspective uh yeah because I know I know you're you're all about the the AI and the digital um the digital space so my kind of thought process as well is yes as the world moves more and more digital there's going to be a lot more products digitalized and a lot of experiences digitalized but at the end of the day us as humans are still in this physical world and so I feel like a lot of physical products and a lot of physical experiences are going to be kind of overlooked and then that there's going to be a period of time where people kind of need something to bring them back you know take off the Apple Vision Pro and put on the beer me hoodie and go drink some beer with their friends um so that's kind of like because I I totally agree with you it's going digital and then as far as the repeat purchases that's something we've been thinking about a lot um and I agree with you it's probably going to have to be multiple products like a trucker hat or something like that but that's also where we want to you know we want someone to buy it for themselves with like their school colorway but then also oh I want to buy one for my dad for Father's Day um I want to buy one for my grandpa because gramp still got it um and that can kind of be the way to try to get repeat uh purchases from One customer so I I want to be clear so I spit the idea in its current form yeah but I sip the idea if it's multiple products multiple SKS maybe and maybe some you know IRL Community event stuff right like in order to access you know this party you need the beer beer me hoodie right and I think that you're right like the TR what are the trends the trends are people want more IRL experiences they want more Community I also like how you're doing I called an anti-trend so the trend right now is getting sober but the fact that you're just like no no this is called beer me it's like the complete opposite yeah I feel like every trend has an equal anti-trend so writing that anti-trend I think is really big I just think that what gets me from spit to to sitp what gets me from not liking this idea to liking this idea is having a multiple product approach holding company approach um and doing things that are a bit less uh harder on the logistics side merchandising side marketing side and doing things that are just yeah a bit easier and cash flowing so that's my that's my feedback to you Mason okay give it up give it up for uh for Mason appreciate and Gramps yeah then uh I love I love a Guinness so I'm a little jealous of you right now so enjoy that well you'll have to get something what's in your fridge actually nothing right now I'm still recovering from last night so uh going to go get bottom list M mosta soon so as expected Mason you know as expected all right later dude all right thank you Mason we are going to bring on our next person uh for those of you are new are coming on here if you want to get on stage you're gonna have to DM me on Instagram with your pitch and the best pitches I will bring up you can bring on a startup idea or you can just tell me what business you're you're you're working on and I'll give you some feedback all right next we're going to bring up S how's it going you are on mute hold on Greg can You See Me Now Greg oh yeah absolutely you made my weekend already it's uh I'm happy to to be live where are you calling in from I'm in nji Tennessee oh beautiful all right have you been to nji before I haven't but I've been to Knoxville before Oh okay it's uh three hours away exactly what uh what idea do you have to share with 1558 of our closest friends in total okay so uh the idea is called rant on me like r a n t o n m e more like um it's more like a listening service or it's what I'm envisioning is like a platform for you know to support people who wants to like freely Express their thoughts and emotion you know basically we connect assuming I want to rant is more like rage room do you know rage room no I'm going to pull it up actually right now so people could see so it's called rage room rage room yeah rage room is where you just want to like you just reg rooms are it's one of those new ideas that came during uh covid you know people just want to Splash things they just want to smash things you know so we are we have specialized rooms where people we go in and uh you know they will just smash things Americans are using room amazing feeling of release ever but is actually doing it a healthy way to get rid of anger for 50 bucks the owner of Houston's Tantrums will give folks 15 minutes to release their inner demons surprisingly the biggest users teachers and stay-at-home moms like Joy bone who's a regular so more like rage room but it's going to be uh online you know assuming you want to you are very angry you don't you are very upset with someone you can you can like uh sign up for our service I'll just listen to you you just rage you you just rant on me and I'll just list in I might not say anything some people just want people that will just rant they just want to rant you know um it's uh it's not like we are not going to be like uh therapists uh we are non- therap we offer non- therapeutic uh support you know you can just go on our website and you know uh book a time and somebody you just start ranting on on someone that is just the idea I've not started just thinking about it cool so basically here's the idea PE people especially Americans are angry and they're it's been validated by uh the fact that these rage rooms are popping up and I think also road rage has gotten worse and worse over the last few years yes so your idea is okay this thing is being validated already uh in the physical world how can I build something in the digital world where someone basically is you you envisioning like a phone call like hey you know Sam let me tell you about how sad I am that my girlfriend left me or whatever yes exactly okay and I just listen and not say anything well not saying anything um I could it depends on what you want some people just want some they just want to talk and you just want someone to listen to them why some they just want you to to talk and you know just encourage them but I don't know how to like expand the idea and how would you charge for it so uh the pricing model I'm Enis envisioning is you pay EG $50 I won't be the only listener like I'll just so on the on what I'm envisioning is on the website there will be or if you want to be a you can you can sign up and we just match a listener and a runer so I I actually surprisingly love this idea like I surprisingly sip this idea I think that there would need to be some interaction between the listener and the angry person yes because if it's just silence I here's what I think I'd call it I'd call it you're totally right.com you are totally right.com okay I'll pin it and I'll get it it's like you call them and it's like oh my God you're not going to believe you know not going to believe what my wife did yesterday and I'm so upset and I can't believe she did that and then on the other end you're here you're totally right you know I there's so many examples of you know tell me more about how how your wife that you know is is is is annoying you know uh we have a rule here by the way we have a rule here that we don't take the domains of the people when we give domain ideas we don't take we don't we don't take those domains yesterday we gave like two or three really great domain ideas and it was like up by someone else in in in one sec oh so so this is Sam's idea this is Sam's idea um thank you yeah the house rules Sam gets 24 hours to purchase but yeah the idea here is I mean obviously you start with human beings on on the end and then you can eventually use agents AI agents to uh answer answer these people um I think that you know this is kind of similar to in some ways beer me the the previous person because you know beer me is one of those things like you know could go viral on Tik Tok um and I could see this with the right domain the right positioning is going to go viral and I think that you know you're trying to make the world a better place right Sam you're trying to you're trying to let you're trying to let the raage out in a more sustainable way exactly exactly so I think this is a this is a big idea this is a sip for me in the comments if you're on YouTube is this a sip do you like this idea or is this a spit do you not like this idea I think this is really smart I also like ideas that start with human beings a as fulfillment and then you can move to AI assisted human beings okay number two and then number three eventually agents so you got number one human number two AI assisted humans number three agent so um I think this is a great idea to get you know could go viral the name needs to be right you're getting a lot of sips in the comments on YouTube so uh for some reasons I'm not I cannot see those sips in the comment I can't see uh are you on YouTube yes I'm on YouTube I don't know I'm seeing it I'm seeing sip sip sip MJ Allen Christopher Strang Cass oh J mix uh you're getting you're getting nothing but sips so oh okay so congrats and uh Brian lry so what if we do this if uh I'm I'm I'm a big follower of yours just so you know what if Greg is going to be our first customer or client well if you know anything about me I'm a very calm chill human being you know oh sure a lot of people listen to my podcast the startup ideas podcast on 1.5 sometimes 2x people have told me hey speak faster speak faster speak with more energy speak with more energy I'm just this is who I am you know I'm literally in the mountains in the middle of C you know Northern Quebec here there's not anyone from from 95 acres in this you know in this area so I'm I'm happy I'm chill um and so I'm not the the the the person but I do think that I do I do know a few people who are kind of or are those angry people who who who do get frustrated really quickly and I'll be the first person to take that and I think what you what you can do and make to make it viral is you can gift an angry session to someone oh okay right it's like oh you need a you you know you know people say like you need a chill pill like what's your version of a chill pill like that's what this should be the name should be like oh I need to take a XYZ and that's your prompt for this weekend that's what you need to come up with um you come up with like a verb for this okay okay I'll do that I I'll work on that I appreciate you I just pinned you're totally right.com thank you so much amazing all right Sam appreciate you coming up yeah you're wa all right I'm going to bring up uh a next guy and I could see people uh like backstage and I don't know if they know I could see them but I think this guy was just like smoking cigarettes just backstage he was and I I think that we're just gonna we're gonna bring up the guy who's in his room smoking cigarettes I don't know if it'll be good I don't know if it'll be a sip or a spit but we're gonna we're going to give him a shot um and he's here Jason the founder of really good you're on mute you just G have to unmute yourself yeah I didn't realize you could see but I was smoking a cigarette before well I'm glad you were just smoking a cigarette not doing anything weird so you know yeah it's better that way I guess exactly so what's on your mind today thanks for coming up um so I've been building this company for about four months now it's called really good and it comes from I was uh I was in tech for like 10 years working at early stage startups and I got tired of it um working for other people primarily um and so I left didn't have a plan started and the first way to get out of it was service providing because I was I'd already done that so it was the easiest way to start um you know being My Own Boss and over the course of about a year and a half I started noticing other people that wanted to do the same thing so I started helping them do that and then I kind of started serving my thought at first was actually to build some sort of you know just like you have a talent agency for musicians or um artists to do that same thing for professionals and just to help them build themselves up uh for a lot of reasons that wasn't the best strategy to go about with because I I think taking the percentage from uh normal people just it was weird to them and so I it ended up shifting into this where I realized basically okay if I want to help them I have to help the companies that are looking for service providers this is like purely Professional Services not you know don't think like plumbers or and don't think SAS software um but the idea is to help is basically that so if you're going to help these people you really have to help companies find the right person for them and thought is that the way to do that is data is this live it's live yeah I mean when I say it's live there's a landing page where you can sign up and make a request that goes to email like it's all what's it very early I use the product right now let's put it like that no one uses the product except for me what's what's a URL uh really good. proo we're gon I'll share my screen so people can see it cool so yeah so basically what we do is we collect data on different service providers agencies can I say something I was like when you were pitching it I did not think it was going to look this nice I don't know if other people in the comments feel the same way apprciate that but I'm like now I'm I I went from really unimpressed to impress really quickly and I'm like wow this is actually looks really cool what was okay so I'm curious what made you go from unimpress what was the unimpressed in the beginning I felt like you were saying a lot of words but not enough I felt like it was a lot of words we had someone came on yesterday and he was like we're like what's your idea he goes it's med school in a weekend we teach you med school in a weekend and that was like it yeah I could see why that's more powerful yeah um what's your version of that my version of that is I mean that's a good question getting you the best service prider provider on the planet for your needs using data I think that this is going to work this becomes a sip if you don't use the word if you unpack what service provider is yeah we put that little thing on top we bu for that exact reason we find the best agency or freelancer but we don't want to do just agencies and we don't want to do just Freelancers because ultimately the right solution for people might be for some sometimes it's an agency and sometimes it's a freelancer it really depends on your needs it depends on your budget it depends on what you're looking for you know sometimes it might be best to work with by the way actually we have one of your um one of your holding company uh like I think you have a brand one that just pivoted the name design scientist yeah so yes oh so it was brand something right it was brand kitchen or something that's one of ours too so something one of them design one I I don't remember which signed up also um I don't know how that happened but so we have about a thousand service providers that have signed up and the way it works is that we get 15% of the first six months which we thought was like a good mix of being fair while still making money off of uh recommendations and unlike a Fiverr or an upwork where you're one you have to do a lot of work two finding people is really hard and three you're stuck with the talent that they have you know Fiverr Talent isn't that great it's not the best um upwork Talent there might there's amazing people by the way in all these places but it's really hard to find them talk talk to me more about the data like what is it you know when I read this I'm like okay Power by data but what does that act yeah if you scroll down you can actually see the three parameters we look at so it's quality fit and trust trust to be honest we don't do a really good job of yet we started that was the first starting point was basically to say hey Greg you know Bob Bob worked with this branding agency and liked them you should probably check them out obviously if you make a branding request um Quality is reviews feedback retained clients so we look at that as also a strong sign of someone who has kept a client for a long time and um the last is trust is fit fit is the one we're best at right now which is basically have they worked in your industry with companies similar to you with your budget your specific needs location etc etc cool so we're going to do like a live landing page roast over here and I think I think this is first of all I love this idea around you're just matchmaking all you have to do is uh what do you have to do you have to figure out uh high quality recommendations around agencies we'll start with oh agencies and Freelancers and then you just have to I mean it's going to be easy to to to sign up some of these folks why because everyone's looking for more business like hey if I can get you for 20% more business would you sign up like probably so and then you need to find growth channels how do you how do you so that's the hardest part right now I mean that's actually my background so that's what I'm good at I haven't I've been actually working too much on the product because I'm doing it right now primarily by myself and so building building a data product is just really hard even with the AI tools they have today you know you can build your own like I can build my own scrapers today something I couldn't have done two years ago and I can start indexing the web by myself but it's not I'm not good at it right and so and that's actually really important because if you think about how we make money there's requests number of requests but more important than that honestly is the number of those recommendations that we make that actually get taken and yes there's a way you know there you're going to convert a percentage even by just making you know solid recommendations but when you have good signals that make them see oh wow this is perfect for me you're going to convert more and you're GNA get customers to come back which I think is really important you're going to get them to recommend it because they had a good experience so like if you think about how the buiness business works it's like requests then percentage of conversion to actually starting but almost more important than that percentage is the percentage later of clients that are happy with who they work with how many lead magnets have you built so this is only up this site is up for less than a month um zero I've been doing it for four months so it's so not none um right now we get all of our leads from friends of mine who work in different companies and from communities and from a couple of Partnerships primarily with like VCS so like you know if VC platform teams like the value creation teams they have like a bunch of portfolio companies that come to them for certain requests for like provider recommendations we just do that for them since we know more than they do here's how I grow this thing and I I do really I think this is a huge idea my friend Julian Shapiro also has a a similar product have you seen it I think it's called pineapple pineapple list yeah yeah I wanted to get the so the way I look at companies like that we've started to onboard Talent networks and agency networks as well and we just drive growth for them like we would never so basically if we would work with pineapple is the way would work is any agency that hasn't signed up with them we would basically use them to Source Supply and if we we would never be able to poach we would have we have a contract that doesn't let lets us makes it impossible for us to poach companies so if we don't have a relationship with that agency already any agency who's in their Network we would it would always be theirs and if ever we drove a lead to them they would get paid for it so you can see both screens right next to each other yeah so I want people on the on the YouTube chat to tell me which one which which value proposition is more clear on the left or the right and I can't see what you're saying but while people are are putting that left or right I think that when I look at something like this it's just so clear what they do pineapple tells you who the best agencies are no one has the data we do we've interviewed thousands of Founders to learn which agency to rely on we match you with the best in growth design and content and then they have a great quote obviously from Ryan Hoover who's super credible oh there's me on it that's funny um so I think that there's a there's room for multiple pineapple lists and there's there's there's a whole there's a hundred matching startups oh Cody Cody's coming in we hold on Cody Schneider I'm gonna I'm gonna bring you on give me one second boom all right we're gonna bring Cody on it's gonna get fun so um I just think that the opportunity is niching pineapple list even more down it's like we're the best matching for SAS businesses like you were kind of afraid about agencies and Freelancers those words you're like well we're not really you know you know we're not just agencies we're also agencies and Freelancers it's okay to start with agencies and then move from there right your goal is how do I get a million AR to start you know and then from there you can you can adjust so I would start thinking about how do I create pineapple list for SAS businesses you know crypto companies AI companies um e-commerce all that stuff and create different landing pages for those particular you have a lot of right now these days there are probably there's probably a talent Network for every Niche so there there's three for e-commerce there's two for healthcare there's it's endless you know if you think about website building you know webflow has a Marketplace framer has a Marketplace Wix has a Marketplace they all have this um for us I think it's actually it's less about the meth well they have it but you have to trust Wix and you have to trust you know yeah but I think for us I think it's more about the growth channels than it is about the product marketing um I mean obviously the product marketing has to improve it's like a month in but it's really about where you get the recommendation from and who ends up getting recommended that gives it the trust like we get plenty of requests the problem isn't getting the request it's converting it um why is that I don't know so you're you're you're getting tons of requests you're getting tons of not tons not tons but you know it's at the point it's it's like we're we're solid in that and there's a lot of ways to continue honestly this month has been slow because it's starting to be summer and I think businesses are starting to slow down a little bit but um that's what I'm feeling but uh sourcing request isn't as much as a challenge Cody what's good 2412 of our closest friends no [ __ ] live right now live dude what in the actual hell okay help sweet I got I have like 30 minutes I gotta leave but by the way if you're on Twitter get off Twitter and go on to YouTube because that's where the comments are so it's like I don't think there's are there comments on Twitter I don't think so on live oh you're streaming Twitter right now okay dude I'm I'm I'm catching up here we go yeah yeah slowing my RO if you're on Twitter get off Twitter go to youtube.com Greg Eisenberg you'll see the live stream and that way you can comment so like if I don't know I'll just continue if that's cool so like what we've been starting to do is basically trying to figure out I mean the biggest problem with the business is honestly cash flow because we our cash flow is delayed basically if you think about it like it takes so much time to complete a request then they meet the company then they actually it takes time for them to start working with them to negotiate with them and close and start and then by the time that company's getting paid we still have net 30 afterwards so we're getting it we're getting paid we have to wait like we only started getting paid last month for a request made like the first request we had made which was in February so it like takes a while and so I don't know if you know the company vendor VR um but they do some they do this for SAS kind of so one of our thoughts was to start basically uh what they do differently is they charge b a b like b n b ndr v like vendor just with no o um and what they do what they said is basically we're not going to become Affiliates which is kind of what we are for agencies or Talent networks that's what we serve as they Ser they basically say to companies we're just going to save you money we're going to do the negotiations on contract and pricing for you with SAS companies because we have tons of data and you don't want to do the work anyway so one of our thoughts is to start offering take a rake off of the money that they save you is that their business model um I don't know how they charge anymore they used to charge like a SAS fee of like 10K a month by the way like a lot totally because they they can save you right if you're going to Enterprise they can save you on stripe alone they can save you enough Toody you know when you go on a website and you're like wow this company has raised Venture Capital Yep this is the vibe I'm getting from this so what's actually cool about them is they started as a business and then they were already profitable and went into y combinator then and then it just blew up 150 million series B Greg yeah I know it just it oozes a16z th% they all just use the same agency what's your company it's really good I think I saw it on the stream but yeah cool great high level what is it so we connect we match companies to the best service providers for that forign accounting to what's producing 80% of your Revenue right now those what type of deal yeah um it's so varied pick a job title who's the who's the who's the one like I love toy but we started off with our partners being BCS and they have their portfolio companies have random requests yeah one time it'll be recruiting and another and we're not going to be able to work with VCS for example if we only focus on one area is the logistic of that the challenge scaling that because it's too variable um no it's actually not so hard I know it sounds ridiculous like every time we do a new domain it's a little bit hard that first time but then it's already set for the next time so like for example we had one company come in that was an e-commerce company that needed SEO help then another eCommerce company needed SEO help and we had already done that work for them and it was really yeah yeah yeah but I'm saying like you know there's enough Ecom companies where you could go make this a ton million ER our business right in like 12 months so I guess it's like what is the inbound that you're getting like from I gu I'm coming in late so the grow side I'm I'm I I I I didn't get the context before so I'm I'm going blind so I apologize yeah so the hard part for me about about like going Niche with it is one that it's it's you're going like right now we're kind of going into a blue ocean without being Niche and with all of the niches there are already there's no shortage of talent networks our concept is to sort of be on top of those as an aggregator like I don't want to be the expert in figuring out the best supply for each of these areas I want to partner with pineapple list I want to partner with the talent networks in e-commerce and I want to onboard their Supply and service a growth channel for them get that totally I I guess where where I'm at is like deal with fivr for example um they have a normal affiliate deal we just adjusted it a little bit so we get 20% of anyone we recommend on Fiverr so if I if I recommend someone on Fiverr I get 20% off theoretically by the way I could go to companies tomorrow and say just work just use do your fivr through us and we'll get your discount yeah what you know what do you what would you do if you were the CMO of of this business I mean it sounds like VC's already have this so I'd go find every company that's written a check for e-commerce as an example and I'd cold email every VC and be like cool this is how we like turn this company from zero to you know whatever the revenues are and they raised the check 12 months later right and just like just send them case studies and what you know whatever that that product offering is um it's great blue ocean right we can always do everything but like if cash flow is the challenge which is always the problem with early stage uh like agency work it's like building some type of it's a it's way easier to communicate hey like we specialize in this and then what's going to happen is then you're going to get referrals on the backside right but like trying to communicate we do everything yeah is is is basically saying like we do nothing right it's very hard with with limited resources to do that communication like from a positioning standpoint so I always try to okay we do this specific thing and then there can always be upsells and you know cross sells on the back side of that or like referrals come in and we do you know you just say yes to anything that comes on the on the on the uh you know the inbound side but I mean again this just from my experience that's that's the way that I see this you know if you're trying to figure out the cash flow mechanism of this like it's gonna be way easier to be like cool any company that's ra hard part about I'll give you an example so like one of our Partnerships that we're talking to is is actually YouTube so I live in Israel in Tel Aviv yeah and there's a YouTube Israel like well YouTube in general they'll pay companies they'll pay for companies videos so that they can start advertising on YouTube because create like the hardest thing for them is to get companies to create a good enough video that can go on YouTube and work on YouTube yep so they'll pay for that so that companies will start spending more on YouTube so we've actually been talking to them about basically they don't they have a spread sheet that they to to like that they never update and that's how they pick the agencies for different companies like they they don't even use that they just kind of think okay maybe this guy maybe that guy and yeah I mean list I with all this it's like I mean it sounds like you have a ton of options it's it's so like I guess what where's the disconnect on the cash flow side is what I'm trying to figure out um yes so the disconnect on cash flow is just that it comes late because of the referrals it's just such a late process I need right now I don't not worried about it but like I'd like to make for money up front like I'd like to charge someone right I want to make money today not in three months in general yeah I I totally I mean that's why I'm saying like a product SI service where it's like yo we zero to one like e-commerce sites right and we do this in a 90day Sprint and like you only focus on Venture back companies and the cost of that whatever we'll say it's 50 Grand you get 25k upfront day one second half of that happens after the Sprint ends like that's how you're going to get cash flows immediately when it's that product high you're saying basically tell them you tell them you buy credit with us for working with any agency yeah like I mean so I own I own a product I service like business right it's like we build newsletters for podcasts that's like the thing you know the offering that we do um and like so we grow like our promise is like yo we grow list by 5,000 Subs a month right like that's that's like our our what we what we what we bring they pay me up front for that like I just have a money back guarantee right it's like yo if we don't do this and like it's not success we'll just we'll give you the cash back at the end of that period right at the end of the 30-day period um but like I'm I'm you know I'm getting that payment up front and then just showing the case studies with this and I can do that because it's like a very specific thing I'm offering right when you're doing agency work in my experience where it's like you're billing On The Backs side of it that's when it's like okay cool like we just did 30 days of work my bill went out you know on the first of that next month and then I have like net 60 to get that cash in like you know it's 90 days before I see a check so in the in the early days what I always try to do is like how what's a product High service that I can offer that will create a cash flow engine so that I can then have that like you know the the flexibility for that when you know if I'm getting net 60 payments later on because again I can to go like all these clients we could go sell them any type of podcasting service after that right but I we abstracted away the most valuable thing and I don't know what that is for you but again using the e-commerce example maybe it's like you know we do e-commerce SEO at scale we we'll build like 10,000 you know uh like programmatic SE landing pages so it's worth noting we don't do any of the work yeah yeah we know that he's saying okay yeah just to make yeah yeah you might not want to actually do any of the work and maybe you find a small shop that actually does the work and then you split the revenue with them right so you you have an offering that you sell some Sprint for some amount of you know or some work for some amount of some for some cost and maybe you don't get 100% of the revenue you get 40% of the revenue but what Cody is suggesting is that you do that because that helps your cash issue and then you're making money on the back end eventually right um and I want to say agencies start like this too right like it's like it's like you know we do Google ads oh can you do Facebook ads yes oh can you do you know and it's just like it keeps going deeper and deeper with this but like having that Flagship product offering is what you get like that's that's way easier to find a foothold within you know the business Community I ask you a question on that do you think that's something where I that the main site has to do that or like you could create really good do Google ads you know gooogle ads and focus on that and have that focus on that and do 100% 100% I mean I think Greg's like or like compy you he owns boring right which is like this whole kind of I don't even know what you call it it's a hold Co now but it's all in the same brand it's like boring SEO like boring ads like Bor like you know different front doors right think about different front doors like boring marketing so we we built an ads team an a an AI assisted tool for ads and then we built an AI assisted tool for SEO and then we built agencies around it but it was really one company that we just changed the front doors to so if you go to boring ads.com and you want to sign up for an ad agency great it kind of just goes into the same slack as the boring marketing one you know what I mean so it's it's one big family I think for you you can just think about different front doors and uh I'm gonna have to we're gonna have to bring someone else on Harve you're GNA be next but I want to say one thing for people building agencies because you you brought up a really good point which is seems like VCS are you know a good channel for you and I'll share I I'll share one of our growth channels that is working and how we do it with and how we sell to VCS and it's related to what you do Jason so we have a business um which is a design and copy agency called um design scientist.com and the majority of the the majority of the clients actually come from VC so how do we do it we cold email VCS and we say hey if you get a few of your portfolio companies together would you be would you know would you be down if we basically did a roast slash give feedback to all their different homepages and basically dissect their funnel and they're all like yeah it's great because then the head of platform at these VC fund is like giving value to their portfolio CEOs so then we have them in a room we do a work shop with them and then we try to sell them afterwards now we have their email we have permission once we do that and we get one of them then we send everyone else in the portfolio say hey we work with this company it's a part of the andri and Horwitz portfolio as an example and then they're more likely to convert and then your cold email strategy just you know gets a lot more effective so I think you're on to something by V you know focusing on VC back businesses and in general I don't like building VC back businesses but I like selling to them thanks so much take care Jason ni to meet you man good luck that guy you know he's he's passionate about not the energy it's just the the fraction like again and I've done the same thing right where you try to do everything to everyone and that's the worst thing you can [ __ ] do when you're being an agency like you want to do the absolute opposite of that you want to say no more than you say yes both to the clients that you pick and also to the things that you like the the jobs you're saying yes to yeah I mean that's what I was trying to explain to him I was like what you're what You' built is cool but it would be way cooler if it was really good for e-commerce or really good for SAS or really good for you know insert Niche here and then his response to me was well I don't really have issues getting customers it's just the cash conversion cycle isn't good I yeah I mean that's the biology of the business then though right like dissect that so if you need cash now then you set up the business so it functions so it gets cash now like that's I don't know again agency everybody wants to do agency like it's an you know what's an agency right is it like him or is it like [ __ ] 10 people or is it a hundred people like there's different everybody measures that differently um so I yeah it people are like oh I started an agency it's like you it's just you doing 20 grand a month Consulting like that's not an right like that's like you doing random jobs or services so yeah uh before we bring on Harvey who's been patiently waiting thank you Harvey um what are you drinking are you drinking anything yeah I was I finished it already I had a I got this this Italian soda it was like a grapefruit Italian soda from Trader Joe D Trader Joe's is the cheapest groceries right now I don't know how that happened it's like the most like you know well-kept secret I I'm paying less there than I am at Safeway like what's going on toally insane man I love it any I must say I I said that if we got a thousand people watching this thing and now we have 3,200 that I would drink some M juice again you better you better dude I want I'll go get stuff for next time we'll do Caesars how about that yeah that's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna do a Caesar I'm gonna go grab uh I'm gonna go grab a Caesar I'm gonna be true to my word let's bring on Harvey to the stage I'm listening Harvey welcome to the stage uh I'm just having a Caesar Harvey how's it going oh looks like you're muted my man oh looks like you're muted sorry Harvey okay good now perfect yeah okay great okay so this is nothing to do with agency um we've moved across God okay okay um okay clamada okay you're in the Canada I'm I'm in UK I'm in London UK oh okay about the business right so um then the dementia manifesto. comom so the website just went up uh this week and what it is it's targeting uh carers of people with dementias so in the states There's 7 million in the UK there's 1 million 54 million worldwide okay and growing by the day what's the website Harvey just so we can drop popping in the chat the dementia manifo.com cool awesome so what I've done that is that I have uh created two reports one for the UK market and one for the US market so people go on and if it's the UK they go on I get their email address and then they get the uh uh the uh report and so what I'm trying to do um and it's it shows basically that government uh dementia hasn't been funded properly it's still not funded by the government if you compare it to cancer or diabetes or whatever um that there's and people it's the carers and the families who are paying for it and it's a scandal and no one's doing anything about it so the idea so I'm I'm using that to uh going to use that to create interest and and to build up a list so it's following your model Greg about creating an audience first and so and then a and then also I've just also created through your community of which I'm a member to um school school uh uh Community forums so when they download the report I'm also asking them to go on and to the uh School again for the UK and the US and so then through that as well as the email I'm going to build up uh email list and then I can build nurture relationship in terms of both the politics but also more importantly strates resources and help for uh basically carers and then the idea would be um in terms of monetizing eventually would be um three or fourfold one is these people are already spending money every day on products to help their loved ones deal with dementia whether it you know whether it's uh games or clocks or or just all sorts of products that are yesterday was just about to go there hary I'm about to drop this in the chat but there's like hundreds of thousands of keywords for like dementia related products like coloring books exact all that stuff yesterday I was in London I was at a a dementia exhibitors conference so I'm sure there is in the states so so there's so one is to uh recommend and get affiliate through that that's one idea the second idea is that um so there are various universities one of them being in London University College London that have produced different resources and packs with people with not late stage but early stage to try and um stimulate activities and stuff like that and my idea is to once I've got a list and some credibility is to approach the university the university to try and license that product so um so and then sell that product give them a one flat fee or a percentage or however however it would work and so that's and there'll be other universities and other dementia centers in the states that also offer or do these type of things so that's another area the other area is um two other areas for uh monetizing would be through the free school Community upsell them into one where there's more resources Q&A bring on speakers bring on different conferences and so you can do that and then the third the fourth thing the final thing is once you've got the list is no one no one is doing if you're in pain which these people are they're in guilt they're in pain they're dealing with very difficult complex uh problems and here in the UK and also in the states and you you need access to Psycho grians and and people who specialize in this and there's very few of these people so the idea would be with those you know the usual 5% at the top who have money the idea would be to introduce them to a panel of experts and then they could I for you know on a monthly basis they would pay on a group call or even on a onetoone call they could then and not giving medical advant medical medications but I can give we or I can facilitate a group of experts who will um uh in terms of whether it's to do with behaviors or what wandering or sexual deviance or whatever it is doesn't really matter whatever their specific their individual specific painful so there are four or five different areas on the back end where there may be the opportunity to uh monetize this business super interesting um so my always go-to question is how do you make money off of this in the next 24 hours um because otherwise the business doesn't have legs like it's like from day one you figure out a monetization strategy um it sounds like so this this the I'm just looking at the website the the so what you built right now is it just like a downloadable PDF is that what yeah just to start to you've got to find a way to get their email I I could go in and create a product or whatever but but you've got to find a way to get their find out the people who are in pain build a relationships and then I I don't today need that money I just as context texting his background I um have for 30 years 20 years 30 years I run what you in the U in the UK we call them care homes in the States they're called memory centers so i' I run these and have owned these centers for donkey for 30 years most of my working life yeah so I I'm not a doctor but I'm a business guy and so but I've been dealing with people who you know and so that's kind of the context so although I'm adopter there I can credential eyesee myself create Authority because I'm dealing with these people and have done for years yeah Greg what's your thoughts um I'm I'm also by the way I think that question around how do you make money in 24 hours is it's not it's it's such a good question and it's it's really just a good prompt you know what I mean and and I more asked that because it's like you know whenever I'm building anything I'm trying to figure out what's the path to sustainability as fast as possible I don't care about the money right it's like that the the organization has a longer uh life expectancy um like you know you're just on average going to do better if the faster you can get cash flow coming in for it um the I mean it sounds like with the memory Center side you already have some like credibility within this space I mean I wonder if this is just like a PR play where you go on every Health podcast in the UK and the US and talk about this I've I've okay that's yeah so I have I've got a list of 3 or 400 podcasts and influencers and Charities and all sorts of people in the UK and in the state in in the states and I my plan is to over the next um over the next month get this report out and go on and like you say as a PR play to get the word out and build up and try and do piggyback on their list because I no list or anything but P piggyback on this this and that's also the reason for for doing the report it kind of credential eyeses there's a scandle going on yep so I mean I I think it's probably PR is going to be the the initial path to build that list and then you inbound them into the site um so there's a database it's called Raonic I just dropped it in the YouTube chat uh but it's a podcast contact database I think it's like two they just raised prices like 249 a month I've just gone in and SC you can go and scrape every email out of there if you want um and uh that will give you the T typically they find you whoever uh the production manager is of the podcast or the show and that is just a way to like go and do this at scale email every one of them that I've published in the last 30 days um you can actually pull this data from podcast index it's a uh like for which shows are actually active and which have like posted them the mo the most uh episodes but I think there's an angle there and then um yeah man I like if you get a little bit of traction I mean as you know this you're going to be picked up in in larger news associations there's uh Greg what's that company that does digital PR that's out of the UK I can't think of the name of it um let me see if I can find it but they they specialize in basically like they Bank Bas basically they make uh like posts for your website that are all around data and then they go and they pitch news agencies that they know will like eat this because it's a story right um so like they would basically like write this article for you with all this research they like put it into this digestible format for a journalist and then they handle like uh like at scale Outreach the journalists to get this story to show up and then what happens is like as soon as a Forbes PS picks it up then everybody picks it up right and so then it creates that flywheel what the name of that yeah yeah I gotta find them hold on give me one second and Cody while while you're finding that can you walk through a little bit okay so let's say Harvey goes on 20 podcasts and he's got 15 hours of content how does he repurpose that content what does that look like because I think he wants to build his own audience th% so how does he do yes so like what we see is the most effective way to do this right now is basically go you go on these shows and then uh get the recordings do get the video recordings and you basically take those video recordings and you turn them into Clips in the blog post if you have like a newsletter you can do that as well I'm like this is actually the company that I'm building it's called swell Ai and it's like content repurposing powered by AI so you upload a video it makes Clips blog posts like white papers whatever it is that you're trying LinkedIn post Etc um but that is then you basically take that you schedule it out to social media again company I'm building I'm totally plugging this right now but we uh so it's like it'll make clips and then it you can schedule those out to all the social channels that you're trying to do distribution through so this is a way to kind of build this like engine so it's like cool I go on these podcasts I make pillar content I then get the the recordings from the p the shows that I go on I plug that into like a you know software tool like this you could also do all that manually outside of uh you know what we've built but then you take that and then it's like okay I'm just basically telling the same story over and over again in bite-size formats and in all the formats that are uh that of like all the channels that I'm trying to be present on which again is like for you it's probably going to be social like I would look at Instagram Tik Tok YouTube shorts that's where you're GNA and maybe even Twitter you can get some traction there um I feel like I mean anything that Facebook owns because they traditionally have a uh uh an older population that's on the platform that's what your is probably going to be your focus so I would probably all of my investment would be in like Facebook and Instagram uh Facebook is really pushing uh for you page content right now which is like what Instagram reels are it's basically their version of that um and I think that you could probably get in front of that audience with this but uh yeah and let me find that PR agency Greg Take the Wheel I miss that all that camot juice made me need to go to the bathroom you know I just talking about uh do you think that though that once the list has been built up that people will pay I it really depends on I think it's like what are you selling right um in my mind like the probably the angle here because it sounds again like you don't like the cash flow piece is less important in the the beginning I if I was in your shoes I'd probably like do this report and then I would release a book a year later or like have a book to drop six months after this um and then from that you could probably go and then the long-term strategy you sell products like like physical products like some type of e-commerce play because again I'm just looking at the keywords that are that are uh like related to dementia products and it's like bras for elderly Elderly with de uh Dem dementia anti-strip clothing dementia um what is this uh door lock for dementia dementia patients um yeah there's a lot of also technology about tracking people going wandering 100% I mean maybe it's a wearable right and it's likea totally then that's a subscription service that's built on top of this totally that's actually probably the better business right is like but but what about the idea though of the two other IDE that I the Affiliates and all that I understand but then what about the idea about because they're in pain either the getting of the licenses from the places that are already doing the research in in dementia and be also the panel of experts giving them access weekly monthly whatever to uh qualified people yeah it could be that I think that it's just I mean you you know service businesses function right like you're doing this in a physical sense is a logistic it's it's brick some like 24 hours a day brck some M totally totally and like I mean if I you know if I was in your shoes I would look at something that is more of a repeatable thing that scales without you know like a lot of human Talent like a lot of these e-commerce companies anymore they use right so the expert the experts thing I agree is it it goes to your point about issues around d d du but the idea though of C maybe them persuading the universities to get have licenses and then I'm just selling the licenses and that involves no it involves no I'm not involveed I'm not relying on myself or anyone else for that matter because if you can sell if if you can sell those licenses of activity packs um and also create a continuity program within that so you're updating that all the time and sell those licenses for th either 500 or $1,000 plus the continuity of $100 a month for new content then that's you know a thousand people thousand that's that's that's a million that's that's that's a million quid straight away without continuity I don't know if that's I don't know if I'm just going wishful thinking rather than the affiliate route I don't know I'm not sure the short answer to your question is you know is there you know do do you think people are are willing to pay for this The Good the good news is you're building in a space that people have disposable income and they want to they want to spend the money so that's why I think that if you could become have the ability correct and I think that if you could build a trusted Source I think that that's step one for me it's like how do I build and earn as much trust via building content and internet audiences going on these podcasts doing like reaction videos to people like Peter artia Andrew huberman with a context of dementia like stitching together videos and repurposing that just being like the dementia personer that that there's no because really I've been in this space a long time and watch it even in the states there's no one doing that kind of stuff totally probably just answer the questions that are like most commonly asked on social media that's right so there's aund questions I've been on like answer the public you know if you're a son or daughter do you get dementia and what is there's a hundred questions that people the taboo questions that no one will ask but really people really want to know like here's one like how to get a POA for a parent with dementia right like 30 search volume right um I mean there's 39,000 keywords I'm seeing right now you could probably write you could probably oneshot articles write these with perplexity a AI Pro right now um I'll drop this in the chat so it's it's public but perplexity AI Pro uses Opus currently and it pulls all the information from whatever's ranking currently so it'll go and like if a journal is ranking it'll pull that into the context window and then write based off of that for the article and like for medical content we're seeing these articles that we're do writing be like really really well written to oneshot it but this could be a way to like zero to one It kind of quickly um yeah Greg what's your thoughts on that K uh Kyle you know has a very Cody response I don't know if you saw this lead magnet push to Facebook 55 yeah 100% And with the wearable like that 100% I mean you could probably do it with the I mean just the yeah I mean it would be to the kids right who who's the decision maker typically the decision maker the there's two decision makers there's the either the spouse who's in her 70s or 80s or it's the son and daughter who's in their 50s and 60s right those are those are the those are the decision makers super interesting um yeah I I mean I would just look at the demog graphic data like what they were just suggesting like whatever the average age for dementia is or the bell curve shows yeah and Target that that subset it's just going to be Facebook ads lead magnet exact I mean it could be Facebook ads to your website that has the lead magnet which is your report and then that just turns into like okay cool then it's the wearable that's a I mean that's a super easy funnel to build and then on the I mean the SEO play there then is go answer every question related to dementia and then the pr play is uh we just we dropped it in the CH I found that company's name and I think somebody else uh dropped it as well but it's called search intelligence they're UK based and basically what they do is like they could take the report that you have they'll translate it into like a digital version and then they go and they'll pitch you know basically every every large news agency on this data and like again with a top something like this they're 100% going to pick it up like anything health related they always like jump on um so I I think that those those three channels would be an easy way and then that product that you're selling on the back in would be an easy way to build this so this is awesome I really love what you're building and I think there's something here it's it's I mean there's no question there's something here and and it's figuring out it's well I think it's figuring I think it's figuring out what is the right product at the right price and the right roll out but I do think that the the audience piece and the content piece everything else once you've figured once that's been figured out and you've built that system and process to go and build that everything else like figuring out what the product is like We can brainstorm five six ideas yeah so thank you for coming on and and I also it's been great fun thank you very much indeed I love what you're doing my my grandma's early onet so like yeah anyway it's we all know someone we all know someone exactly one and two of us know it's insane thank you yeah thank you man all right we have one last one last person let's do it and uh let's see let's see what he's like you never know right you never know what could be I kind of love it man it feels like Chat Roulette but like yeah exactly well we we don't know you know Alex let's see hi how you guys doing Cody what's up man yeah I'm doing the this my girl just got home from a night shift so I gotta I gotta help out man I gotta be love it brother I love it yeah we were we were at the park the other day with our dogs and I saw the episode of Cody talking about him being out at the park and stuff and I thought that is just like me um love it man checking in from San Diego again today I have this I have this thought in my mind um some numbers that kind of blew me away about our city San Diego California there are 30 million unique visitors every uh tourist uh to the city every single year um and I know that a bunch of local people are looking for things to do in the city but there's not really an authority that you can go there's a bunch of influencers if you just scroll like you said I've noticed Facebook pushing on Instagram uh more local things in the in the reals and in the carousels and stuff like that and if you just go there's a bunch of influencer posting content about things to do but there's nobody that prepackages that for you and ships it out to you in an email and says yeah and things that are going on in real life I mean we have the weather um you know we have some of the best like know events going on U the beaches and stuff like that 30 million people visit every year and I I verified it and semrush the the traffic and the search results for um uh things to do in San Diego and things to do in California things like this and there's at least 40 50 100,000 searches for that alone there's hundreds of thousands of searches for hotels to stay in um from the 30 million people coming in every single year uh last year we had our large this year and I think it brought in like 38 billion or million billion dollars of of Tourism money but I I just what's a good way to monetize on all this traffic and I I think it's just been about information about packaging that information um and shipping it to the right people who are interested in doing this whether that's via a newsletter a Blog How would you guys go about you know capitalizing on all this volume of Tourism and local people who are looking to do stuff in the city oh this is so hard um so I I did uh Consulting for a tourism Association at one point and like you it is like one of the most Cutthroat Industries because it's just like so many people are competing in it like ranking for things to do in XYZ city is gonna be one of the hardest things that you've ever done the thing that immediately came to my mind so that there's that trend of what you said 35 million 11 billion spent in San Diego in 2019 on tourism related activities um but the the other thing that you could attach that to is the majority of people are starting their searches on social now rather than going to um a uh like Google or like someplace like that to to find what to do um so there's probably an angle Greg and I actually talked about this on another pod I believe or another episode where it was basically like you become uh The Authority for like you know there's kind of two different plays here it's like you individually are this like you you go answer like things to do in San Diego in February like I'm just looking at the list here like uh things to do alone in San Diego things to do Solo in San Diego and you basically make content for every one of those keywords and put it across social because people are searching those things um the other side of it is you go like the B2B route you go to you go to you know companies basically and you're like yo I I'll make these videos or include you in them or you know there's some type of payment structure around that but Greg I'm curious your thoughts I think the so social here is where the Arbitrage exists currently you competing with the website is going to be like I mean I've been doing this 15 plus years like that makes me nervous thinking about that right right yeah it's a big city too yeah totally so so I gotta be honest I don't love these types of businesses um it's I get pitched on it a lot and I've actually invested in several businesses that were trying to create apps that were supposed to be like I just landed in San Diego what are like the coolest right place to go to and they all end up pivoting to some B2B version of it because right monetization is so hard yeah I were you other side of this go ahead Greg sorry I have another idea if I were you I would I would pick something else to do as your main thing and as your side thing you know if Tik Tok is the new review just create a channel where you review things and you build an audience just very organically and you drive them to a newsletter and just let let it just be local Tik Tok meets newsletter and Mon and it's just like a monthly email where it's like a recap and you can probably automate a lot of that with AI anyways and then sell ad space to the San Diego tourism Association right so right you can actually Target tourists that are visiting an visiting an area on Facebook ads this is something that at least you I haven't done this in probably 18 months but you can for sure used to be able to do this quote don't quote me on it but um you so basically you can be like anybody that is doesn't live in that area that's currently in that area you can Target them right so actively you could Target Taurus right so the other way that you could go about this is like you make an agency that's for these tourism like you know type businesses like so for example say somebody does like paddle boarding in the sound or some [ __ ] like that right you go to them and you're like yo we'll run Facebook ads and do Le gen for you to the two tours that are visiting this area or the other side of it like is later on you have the organic social side that we're talking about and you do the paid social make an ebook and it's like 20 things to do in San Diego when you're visiting right something super dumb and simple and run Facebook ads to that to the tourists that are there like you're probably going to get like super cheap conversions that turns into an email newsletter and then go to the tourism Association that's in that in San Diego um like they have state you know they have state budget and funding that they have to allocate on a yearly basis and you're like yo we know that all of like I have this list email list of all these people exactly that have either traveled here or you know whatever that ends up being um or they here currently it's probably you know coming back but then you can probably do some type of like yearly deal with them where you like if we're going to do 12 issues or 24 issues you're going to sponsor that and then that turns I mean it's probably a good little like side business the scale version of this is then you go to every city in the US and you you make this exact playbook for you know every like you do it for every every major Metro right um and that's that's the $10 million version of this but this the smaller version that I'm talking about is probably start AR social organic yeah to totally initially is what is what I thought yeah and I I wanted to com comment on the last person who was on Harvey and just um if I could give my thoughts I I worked in healthc care with people with dementia for like 10 years and there is so much demand for these kind of products um the for the and we all know somebody who has dementia or Alzheimer's and people are looking for workbooks coloring books and and things like digital products that people in dementia would absolutely buy like my mom right now has a brother who's dealing with it and she buys coloring books at the 99 cent store and just looks at things for for him to do that will help him and there's people who are getting to that age group who are looking for things to help themselves with um who are usually retired have more disposable income and things like that and I just thought Harvey had such a nice idea but um thanks for having me on guys you guys are always aesome love it man tourism is super hard it's again it's I I think it's the building the media version of that and selling it to a state that is terrible at allocating budget like again I've seen deals where it's like they have I saw this blogger have like 20,000 Subs on a newsletter and was getting paid 150 Grand a year to like just write a newsletter a week like just dumb dumb [ __ ] right and but the state was funding it and they don't know the value of any of this and so anyways that's just something there for you yeah yeah now I hear you I'm taking it all in I'm a sponge thank you guys for having me on man good luck yeah yeah have a good one take care so I think that Alex gets the nicest guy on the planet award for this live stream and Harvey gets probably the big the highest impact award you know and he's just like lowkey owns like a bunch of these homes like Legend the subtext of that conversation too was like I don't give a [ __ ] about the money I'm trying to make like social impact with this I'm I already I already secured the bag [ __ ] yeah like I've been doing this for 20 to 30 years 100% I got and so that was really cool I mean a lot of it goes on diagnosed too which is like a huge you know a huge piece of this um so I yeah I don't know I dude I I love the the local stuff it's like I feel like that is the same as like somebody pitching local news and I'm like yeah it's a great idea everybody wants it there's not enough local news like there's just like not enough things happening for you to even make like a Channel about this so yeah it's like you always he the same ideas where it's like uh recommendations uh local news an app to find your friends totally totally but there's always like something in that though right like there's like a layer down of that like again like if you went and you're like hey uh you know I if I was them I'd go find like every company that's on Airbnb uh what is it called like their events thing experiences yeah I'd find every company there and be like yo we do Facebook ads to tourism for you like yeah you know we know how to Target tourists that are in the area that are looking for things to do like give us some type of offer and we'll just run it on the background get them the idea dude the product service offer for Airbnb experiences 100% 100% I mean that that and then that's replicable I mean you go and you get you know charge 2K a month for the small business or or you know whatever that number is that will make sense for them it's probably going to be closer to that 10,000 range just because that's what I've seen them spend in the past but um I mean go get a 100 clients offshore Talent they're running the ads for it uh like use the same types of creative over and over again pick the big cities that people travel to Nashville Austin San Diego you know any of these places where they drop in um they're trying to see what to do uh and then you probably could like section it down where it's like oh parents with kids we know like the you know the zoo or whatever right um so you can actually like again you can be like oh they're a tourist and they have kids under the age of 12 like you know you can Target those people and basically run ads to them right um so something else that could could happen that's interesting you used to be able to Target on Facebook ads people who entered an area in the last 24 hours and don't live in that area AKA tourist it's insane let me uh let me go see if you can still do this targeting uh it's been a minute since I've ran it but I'll do it live while you're we're in the background are we done we calling it or what's your what's your we're calling it we're calling it you've been grinding man how you been how long you been here two hours I know an hour and a half it's easy plus the camat juice that keeps you going you know yeah it's a revitalizing you know totally Cody you have anything to plug before we head out no man nothing to plug uh I think this is like startup School in a new way and it's like very interesting because it's like just lives thinking also with this type of stuff you get you get so many at bats for business like businesses um and that to me is like I the thing I'm obsessed over right now is like how do I get more looks at the plate so like in baseball it's like you know you're trying to see as many pitches as possible like read Moneyball and it's like you hit better if you see more pitches right and that that idea I'm trying to apply that like more and more into my life uh so I feel like this is doing a service to that right it's like I get I get at bats at the plate like where I'm seeing other people's pitches but I don't have any of the the downside of like I strike out right and so anyways that that's the only thing I'd leave with people to think about as they go forward with this but I think what you're doing here with this Qui is so sick cool I appreciate it um yeah man no real plug for me either except that if you do like this you probably just want to subscribe and put notifications on on YouTube because Twitter's suppressing links right now so go to YouTube at Greg Eisenberg and then totally click subscribe and uh oh the other the only other thing that is sorry this is just like news so I'm I'm dropping it because it's [ __ ] insane I just tweeted about this like last night but so my friend reached out to me he's like IG T Tik Tok uh and YouTube shorts famous started porting his content over to LinkedIn and he did 400,000 views he just texted me this morning it's at 500,000 now but he did 400,000 views in the last seven days on LinkedIn with only 2700 followers on his account so why is this happening LinkedIn is ju just starting to roll out a for you page content uh just like every other channel so there's going to be a tab that shows up on everybody's LinkedIn mobile and it's going to be just like infinite scroll type content and if you make good business content on any of those other platforms you just Port it to LinkedIn like there's a huge opport it's is blue ocean right now so that would be the only other thing i' throw out for people just that I've seen on the front lines 100% I'm I I already got a few post scheduled for next week just to try it out I love it and it's all about repurposing right so totally that's why I like long form is like you can do something like this for an hour and a half chop it up into like five or six clips you totally that's my company right so like SW that's what we're doing there's the plug make pillar content turn it in we just actually figured out how to make it so it'll write like so I I take an episode I'm like list 20 longtail keyword phrases related to this transcript writes like perfect titles and then you match those against like are there is there keyword volume for it and then within the app it'll just like Yeet out [ __ ] 20 different articles and you can publish them right to your website I'm like this it's about to get so crazy with all this I mean you you already know this but it's it's there's there's so much like the amount of content a company's going to be able to create with like one good marketer is is it's going to function like a hundred people are working on the team like that's where we're headed with this or we'll just automate it entirely away like with an agent that's just like running a Playbook so I don't know we'll see what happens but have you uh have you seen Mr beasts views.com no so Mr Beast launched a kind of like competitive analysis software for YouTube no way vs.com is that what he is that what he owns he owns that and it's really smart why why what's your take on it talk to me about it well I think it's just here's here's my take I think that Mr Beast tried Beast Berger tried Beast BS and he's like wow that's a lot harder than I thought it was gonna be put together prodct physical product put together like a crack team of like seven engineers and he Knows YouTube so you know it's it's you know founder product Market fit and now he's just like you I haven't used the tool and and I should use it I mean but basically it allows you to just like check more information about different YouTube channels dude are you seeing the traffic to this thing a a month into this holy what is it what what do you check for that I'm just looking at sem rush just because I had it open um let me share my screen real quick yeah uh can we see that yeah cool I mean this is what launched in I'm guessing Mark's probably soft yeah I it's just going vertical right um I that's going to be huge I mean honestly what that functions has too for an influencer is that's almost like a Media Kit like here's all the data you want like this is CPM here's what proves it right um totally I'm curious to see what pages are doing the best let me look I also I also think it it it puts him at like the center of and not that he needed it but he's still like you know he's gonna have the top YouTube creators using it and then he could be like oh hey uh NE boys like we should totally collab on this video yep yep yeah I mean I assume I assume that their tenko on YouTube says social blade clone like it it is kind of like a social blade clone they're not there yet but has anyone have you seen social blade yes like forever ago yeah that's what I thought that's why never really used it yeah um I mean there's probably an opportunity then to disrupt that right and then what social blade went like all they went to Twitch as well if I remember I mean there's probably you go to every place yeah YouTube twitch Twitter in stagram analytics and then this is as a subscription service for I mean this all this turns into is an influencer marketing tool that you're going and selling agenes access for right and like marketing associations you know 20 grand a year do unlimited searches to find all the influencers in your category that are getting views that's you know whatever the the the filters are that you're trying to do um dude that's gonna be a huge company this GNA be a huge company holy holy [ __ ] look at this look at Social blade yeah then you could let's see like just the UI is just so brutal by look look at this yeah can't even filter down on it well the thing you could do too with YouTube um so just like I was talking about ronic earlier where you basically like they've created this database of access all those people you can do that same thing you can actually scrape YouTubers email addresses from the their channels and then just like that's how we do reach out for like influencers that we're working with so hypothetically you know he goes and he scrapes all the emails of all these influencers or whoever their teams are right and then sells access to those that's the pay wall gated that goes that that ends up uh ends up happening but have you heard of this stream charts no I haven't me neither I'm gonna let me share my screen stream charts is that the oh this is not okay stream chart this for live streaming yeah looks like on ke and [ __ ] I don't know it's not letting me get to it interesting but I I believe you yeah I'm just seeing it right now uh looking like twitch YouTube ke just every place that they're streaming occurring and like who the tops are that's interesting yeah I don't know what what do you like why do you feel like so you think he's just doing it for like clout or like what's the angle here because it feels I mean the game play for me for him is like it feels obvious right like especially with his demographic of his audience like if you look at the average age it's like a 15 if I remember right from what I read so it's just like you know go sell Candy Crush clones and you'll print probably a hundred million in the next 18 months I think he's dipping his toe into software and this just makes the most sense my guess is is doing a a a software holding company and he can build like a bunch of tools for creators yep that's my guess I mean or I mean if something you could probably sell so easily is do a course clone so like go clone podia or teachable again another that's another billion dollar company that he could spin off of this and then just use his audience on YouTube to basically sell that totally my God this is the future though right it's like own distribution you put whatever you want on those rails and then like overnight you just zero to one this company and it's sustainable and then it just like hired the team to basically run it you move on to the next one like that is you know this is the Greg Playbook I didn't realize that he made a game like if I'm him I'm acquiring like a mobile app Studio totally just it's already built already built y then you just like pump traffic to it 100% yeah 100% make like I like what go find whatever the top iPads apps are like do Acquisitions for all of them and then I mean again overnight you you would make the money back in probably 30 days after the deal closed 50 bucks to cut your hair are you doing it hell yeah dude I'll get a I'll get a mullet on the next call I'm dead serious I'm over it it's hot we'll just go full gr Brooks for 50 bucks I'll do it for free four whiskies in hell yeah you're like Harvey you're like I don't need the money why there's point it yeah all right time next next time we'll get you uh to do a live live shave are you gonna who's gonna cut it yourself no I'll uh I'll just have my girlfriend she'll just stand in the back faceless faceless faceless just right here and she'll just just cut it while we're live that's so good so we'll have her like roll a joint you know while we're on stream as well that'll be so funny all right I need to bounce all right H yeah brother we'll talk you soon later later all right so there you have it another Saturday brainstorm that was fun thanks everyone who came on again go to YouTube subscribe hit that notification Bell so you know the next one's coming up if it was if this was fun share this with your friends uh the live stream will be available it takes like a few minutes to upload so people can watch us later and uh have a great day have a creative day later everyone

the mem coins are a good argument is just that um marketing is harder than ever in today's world finding attention on the Internet is nearly impossible today and what you're about to see are a lot of meme coins actually turn into real businesses like the way I think about meme coins right now is there's like the meme coins that you can just kind of speculate on whatever and then there's going to be the meme coins where like they basically see that as a customer acquisition strategy just like some nft Brands did like the most successful upand cominging exchange today is an exchange called backpack they launched on the back of an nft Community called madlads right so their user acquisition strategy was let's go get 10,000 people to buy our nfts and then boom we'll launch a crypto exchange and now they're the fastest growing crypto exchanges right now because they had this baked in audience of people who own the nfts so there will be some successful companies built on the back of these meme coins most of them will end in tears

I don't even know what this means a med school in a weekend like oh that's sick I'm so down you know that's the thing the pitches that work like you know because now I I'm getting like 100 DM you know

Half Bake ideas Half Baked ideas okay so yeah I'm a finding a medical student so so the the idea is like right now A lot of people are hyped about hubman optimization running clubs peptides stem cells everything all the good things so but not everyone like understands like the basic like physiology and Anatomy about all the things so the IDE year is to create like a course called med school in a weekend where I just go through the whole med school curriculum very basic very simple so people can like get an idea what everyone is talking about like so you understand what hman is actually saying in three and a half hours oh super interesting yeah this is a lock for me it's a lock dude yeah this is start cing all usally look up [ __ ] in the background you don't see our screens right now but we're all doing research no yeah this is a lock this is a lock and a half so so the thing is the I I have to think about how to get like traffic to the site so essentially I thinking in the beginning I need some like probably need some testimonials for like some Ral people in the beginning maybe the codies the Gregs a social play so this is a social clip play of like you have some hook and use huberman I would just you literally show huberman like hubman said this on the last podcast right and it's like some [ __ ] art you know esoteric [ __ ] that nobody knows what it is and exactly exactly and then you're like you're like let me know like like uh like let me let me explain to you in plain English what this is and then it's like boom you just go into it or like I would probably you need to probably add some social proof there so it' be like I'm a fifth year med student let me explain to you what this means boom and then it drops right into that and then that's top of funnel and then you just lead them into you know it's the classic you know Community to you know whatever whatever Greg's Playbook is now to like get drip them down into to uh to this thing I mean you probably just send them right to the course and then run remarketing and that type of thing but what your guys thoughts yeah I think uh yeah audience Community product right it's simple short form top um I think that the name itself is VI is just viral like it it it it creates curiosity and Intrigue so somehow the domain's available so get it because someone I said a domain that was available before and someone took it I think so get it like right now I don't know why you're listening to us right now like I have my brother oh you literally by the domain like right now some [ __ ] will go do it it's there's too many people on this it's probably happening right now I know I know I was like love don't do this yeah rules exactly yeah I think uh what what are you gonna charge for something like this yeah that's the question my my now I'm just ripping right now so I'm thinking we know you're ripping we've known you for two minutes you have you have nothing but a domain now let's go so so I'm thinking like you can begin like lower in the market start with like Twitter Instagram Etc then you can take that as a lowest TI course I don't know like $49 or something then you can buy up some traction more way more 54.99 at least 497 start with that you know how much med school cost B one I live I live in Denmark it's free no what do you mean no no you live in New York City now and med school cost $400,000 yeah okay and that's on the website you put med school for you know Columbia University $400,000 with a bar chart and then you say Med school9 99 yeah but but the year start with like yeah maybe go higher in price and then um you can use be more trust sorry this is a psychological thing the higher the price the course is hell yeah I love carlburg you got green can right now let's go um yeah the higher the price is the more trust is built into it so if you actually go lower it's going to negatively affect the sales that you get like every course I've ever helped people sell I don't sell courses because it's a rule um but every course that I've ever helped people sell uh it we've increased price and only seen conversion increase over time so it's it's you can start with a course maybe higher price and then when you build up some traction you can do another course a bit more advanced and you consider to like people who are Premed nurses Pas people who want to med school or nursing school and then you can build up some traction there get some testimonials and then Tres to roll out to high schools maybe I did Consulting for this company forever ago um they did like certifications like career certifications um dude they printed money and it was literally just an online course business like they had to get actual CER you know CER like certified at a government level um but a lot of the times if you're a practitioner you can go and get that super easily like that that we're going to teach this course and this is a cuu or whatever but like it was a requirement to get into nursing school right and then all they did it was just a Content play for like top a funnel down into this like you're this company you know the first version is you sell through this hubman thing we're talking about but it probably evolves into that where it's like oh this is a career certification for the medical industry type of company right um yeah I mean that's that that there is like a 50 million to100 million a year business when you get get out of here get out of here you you've got want want in I can I can send it to the first version Oh I would love to see it we love we love when people actually ship on this stuff half the time nobody does anything so don't don't be an idea guy be a product guy entrepreneur even though I have one in my name but entrepreneur all right man get out of here go build get you and your assistant get your who is this guy it's his brother my brother yeah we have the same name almost amazing you guys are you in mid school too I go to law school even better weekend I mean what are we doing franchise dude Law School in a weekend is so such a good idea pay for business law school in a weekend totally all of us entrepreneur literally have a business law book that's sitting in my library and like I haven't touched it in 3 years and like it's the [ __ ] most dense [ __ ] ever just tell me the [ __ ] exploits I can use in business like that's all I want yeah let's go thank you guys later yeah good luck man nice to meet you guys [Music]

that's that's where we're at that's where we're at right now that's where we're at beautiful so um as people are trickling in I was thinking there's a few options of sips something to sip on that I could be sipping on and I need everyone to tell me what I should be sipping on before we get to the startup ideas I I need to know so we have three options option one Budweiser zero non-alcoholic uh non-alcoholic beer 50 calories zero grams of sugar you know what you see is what you're going to get so that's option one budweis or zero option two is your classic carlburg Danish pner the light beer you you know it's a nice nice uh nice can by appointment to the Royal Danish court and it's got the sort of bonus effect that my last name is Eisenberg and carlburg kind of sound similar cousins cousins we're basically cousins and last but not least we have our I'm not g to try to chatar we got our chatar which is uh our original Czech logger owned by the Czech Republic so you know that the government of the Czech Republic's getting a few cents from this never had this could be interesting it's only brewed in the Czech Republic kind of interesting so a bit more interesting than carlburg so what's it going to be I need everyone to go in the chat tell me what to be drinking start with the carlburg carlburg pilsner let's get dizzy oh okay no votes for the Budweiser zero I need to try Bud zero I'm I'm big into it it's this is this is crazy because everyone's telling me that you know alcohol is out but now I have the Sip the Sip Community telling me that alcohol is in you got to trust the market there's literally not one person has said Budweiser yet yeah but zero afternoon Nath you're only saying that because you're last name looks like zero lit literally zero start with the bud then go to Denmark and then check okay so a little flight a little tour startup story Little flight I have this Topo Chico but it's cooked so I might need to step away and get my own array yeah get your own array for sure my own flight bringing child to trauma back my bad my my bad we won't won't mention it again we won't mention it again no zero for you it's 11:00 p.m. here okay so what's

fights your sh with a Michelob I don't have so you know but yes Michelob then carlsburg then the unusual drink check all right what do you think Jordan what do you think people want I like the I like startup stories flight but we'll put the butt at the end and we're going Denmark then Czech then Bud Denmark then Czech then bud so without further Ado boom we are gonna get this started so if this is your first time here let me explain how this goes down you are going to come with your startup ideas or you can come with a business that you have already created you send me a Instagram dm with like a oneliner two liner a thre liner just outlining what the idea is or what you want reviewed like hey I'm working on this business but like I need help and my Instagram is Greg Eisenberg you're going to DM me and then the the most interesting DMS I'm going to send you a link you're going to come up on stage and we are going to jam live in front of everyone uh and we will we'll give you feedback so that's how it works but I will say one thing so if you come up here you have to be prepared for what we call a sip or spit now if you come up with a good idea here what people are going to do is they're going to they're going to sip that idea that means that's a good idea exactly but if it's a not good idea people will say spit so that just means it's not that great of idea you got to go back to the drawing board so that's how the startup idea brainstorm works and without further Ado cheers it's Friday delicious very light basically tastes like a bud zero honestly and while that's uh while that's happening I'm going to put these two back in the fridge and uh Jordan should we just um pin a message um on YouTube for new folks coming in so that they know to DM me on Instagram at Greg Eisenberg yep M PR Pride absolutely absolutely all right so I'm pulling up my Instagram let's see if the requests are coming in yep they just started and I am going to be sending the link can't um I said I can't pin it on on here but everyone knows everyone knows the drill uh you can pin it on YouTube so I'll do that yeah let's [Music] see pin message it has been pinned boom and I got a couple requests some sending the link right now via Instagram and be ready you know we've had people you know take the calls from buses we've had people on walks you know Escape their families you you know don't worry you don't have to look your greatest we understand no someone had PJs on too or or totally yeah they were like about to go to bed and then they came on stream absolutely you know what inspired me to drink beer on this is I was watching a roaring a roaring Kitty live stream from like back in the day and he's always drinking beer on his live streams then you got to do it I mean if it's good enough a roaring Kitty and we almost have a hundred people we almost have a hundred people this is this is what we're talking about 10 two baby we just did it and uh and the requests are coming in and Leo Leo we are going to add you to the stage but we don't see you we do not see you Leo so let's get this view going oh we can hear you all right um my camera seems to be on I'm not sure what needs to be done on my end camera off camera on again my God come on now I've been waiting for this moment for weeks well what can I do here settings we're going to put you we're going to put you back behind stage and you figure it out behind stage and you'll come back this is you know we'll get you Leo we're not going to forget about Leo come on Boom hello guys how do I pronounce pronounce your name Eder Eder yeah yeah yeah it's our name from B country from where weird where is it from B country oh cool well welcome to the stage thank you thank you guys what do you got for us well uh I'm actually uh the kind of testing uh developing an MVP uh which is a web app right now but it's uh meant to be yeah I don't think it makes sense for it to be an app just a web app I think it's fine uh it could be something like um well uh the idea consist on let me put it in words because it's right now it's just an idea and I'm not used to to pitch it but I'm going to try um let's say you want to contact some expert in something that has an Instagram account or it is an influencer or something and uh these people usually have a lot of uh different um contacts a lot of people trying to contact them and of course uh they cannot attend every uh message they send them or they cannot even uh speak with their users right so uh this is an idea that will allow people to contact influencers UM by paying them I mean you can you as an influencer could for example create a a profile on this web app and then set some pricings for video call for a normal call for chat and then uh put put this link on your video on on your social accounts and then people can contact you can request a contact and when you accept it and you contact with them you get paid the amount that you that you set and which influencer like you know any influencers or are you specific to a type of influencer yeah I think mostly influencer that uh are not too big because uh most of the times these influencers have their like agencies and and stuff and this Co comp the the the scener because um well uh they they also want to get paid uh because uh all that happens with that influencer they want to get paid because of it so mostly like small or medium influencers that are experts in some topic maybe marketing influencers maybe you know influencers that don't have agencies behind them and they have a business model besides the the visualizations and the and all of these apps and stuff they they do on their social media yeah so we I asked people if they sip or spit this idea and you're getting a ton of sips you're getting tons of sips people are people are obsessed with this idea and great my my personal opinion is it's a spit and it's a spit because it's really hard to do what you want to do so what you're trying to do is very similar here let me share my screen uh so it's very similar to essentially intro um sorry can you repeat can you see my screen yeah. it's called intro so you have people who you know you can buy sessions these are these are influencers and experts that you can buy sessions with them and there's a bunch of different Cate Wellness career Style Beauty astrology so these are Venture backed this a venture backed company um doing Millions a year in revenue and what they're doing is just it's so hard if you know anyone who wants to create a Marketplace anyone who's listening to this like think about how hard it is you have to like get all these people to say yes and these are all like really busy people so that's one side of the marketplace and then you have to build the traffic to to get people to book because you're not going to get you know Alexis oan the co-founder of Reddit to keep that Lincoln bio unless he's seeing bookings so the hard part about this is the market that you're trying to Target here is really busy people who like don't really need the money and then you're competing against people who you know look at look at some of their you know Kevin Hart is an investor so I don't think this is a particularly a good idea but here's what I would do uh I think that the core of your idea which is there are influencers that are smaller that could use new ways to monetize like that's the core of what you're saying it's like you know you're not talking about Kim Kardashian you're talking about Nano and micro influencers yeah there's an opportunity to build an service business an agency that is specifically focused on that market so it's like we don't touch influencers over 100,000 followers once you get 100,000 followers or 500,000 followers whatever the number is go to CAA go to UTA go to these big talent agencies that'll manage you um and you know let them have it but there's probably a you know 10K to 100K a month business uh that is just Consulting working with some of these influencers and help and just and and just building an agency around it now that doesn't mean you can't create the marketplace in two years from now it just means that step one is to build relationship with the nanom micro influencers through a service business way easier than building a Marketplace and then step two eventually don't forget your big vision but you know step two is basically once once you've built that credibility and you're the you know the guy who is the Nano influencer guy or the micro influencer guy then you can you you can think about building the marketplace so that's that's my take on your idea okay kind of kind of like it so nice to have your your opinion on this and thank you to your community seems like they are love it like but of course uh um having the same place uh influencers and users of course users are more open to this than influencers so I understand that that this is the the the most difficult part of the of this business of course so thank you Greg and thank you thank you so much thank you for coming up here you're a legend have something to to to say or yeah I agree with Greg and you could even start very small with like a newsletter as the the MVP where maybe you get people to subscribe Nano influencers subscribe go get go win a couple brand deals or whatever and send them opportunities that could be like the lowest hanging fruit where you could start this today even so um I agree with okay thank you guys yeah good have a good later meet you Leo uh no we don't hear you but we see you now which is positive we switched inputs last time we couldn't see him now we can't hear him Amy to the stage welcome Hi how are you guys good are you excited to be here I am I am a new follower um but already a huge fan and I um I've had a ton of ideas lately and so something like this is just awesome I love what doing well we're we're lucky that you'll share it with this with this community what's what's on your mind all right so uh my background is in uh fintech proptech and uh one thing that U I had an idea around is there's not currently to my knowledge a service or a tool that is aimed at home sellers that uh helps them offer seller financing as an option to to to sell their home a lot of the seller financing like resources that you see online are mainly aimed at at buyers and so the idea here would be that uh a service that that basically serves Sellers and helps them with everything from you know Soup To Nuts as it relates to seller financing so getting contracts um you know Finding uh a potential buyers um qualifying those buyers underwriting those buyers um and then all the way through like closing and collecting payments um and really uh the idea would be aimed at those older sellers who um don't need uh you know the cash upfront but would rather have the steady stream of income um and and really be able to serve them from start to finish so how would that exactly work so and and maybe you can explain seller financing while you're while you're explaining it for folks who don't know what that is because I mean I'm interested in this I my apartment is listed for sale um I've locked in a 2.875% 30-year mortgage yep um and uh yeah how how would you work with someone like me how would that work yeah um so you uh you have your home listed on the market um so I I actually got this idea from my own situation where I have a rental property that I want to offload in the next year or so I love my tenants um they they're great tenants they pay on time they've really settled into the home so I would want to sell it to them but they have really shitty credit and so the idea would be that um I I would be able to go to this service that I'm thinking of and say hey I I happen to already have a buyer in mind but maybe I don't need to um what are the what are the steps that I need to take to be able to close on a seller finance deal so I obvious as a seller I need a promiser note and I need to record a lean on title and I need to figure out a way to collect payments and I need a way to structure the deal so um you know how much do I get down from or how much do I ask for uh as a down payment what are the monthly payments how much do I charge in interest those are all things that I think um there needs to be a resource uh available for these sellers who really don't know anything about the mortgage process like yourself um but um uh but like want to be able to take advantage and I I think also as the market right now obviously it's it's more of a sellers Market but as the market turns and becomes a buyer's market I think it also becomes an advantage for a seller to be able to offer um financing uh and not have your buyer have to go through a bank this is a major this is like such a sip idea yeah it's like it's a gulp it's it's it's one of those ideas you hear it and you're like why doesn't this exist yeah which is a media green light media green light how would you how would you what's the business model of this of this business so I think you can easily monetize it with an upfront fee um I don't I haven't thought like specific numbers yet but um an upfront fee plus a um a percentage of the payments that you're actually collecting on the back end so like a a loan servicer for example you know collects 25 bips on every payment that they collect on average U so it' be something similar to to that your credibility also just went through the roof when you said bips bips baby and it rhymes with SIP so I'm kind of like you know where do I wire the money this is I'm so glad you like it because I had a hard time validating this idea because I don't know very many people in the same shoes but um encouraging how do you actually go and start this thing like what do you need to do to actually start this thing honestly I think uh it's something that you can start small I think the biggest thing is getting those like legal uh resources to be able to draft contracts that's not my area of expertise but um like I I think there's an easy way to Market this to homes that have been on the market for a period of time and haven't sold and sellers who maybe are having trouble selling um also targeting again uh like uh Boomers who are ready to downsize their home and again want that that steady stream of income um but but I think you start really simple with you know a basic landing page some legal resources um there may be some licensing uh involved as well that you'd have to get licensed as a a mortgage you know um servicer but um I I think that would be pretty minimal so yeah so I think there's there's like the startup cost of the legal side right and then there's the startup cost of like the landing page the name um and then there's the cost of customer acquisition which you know to me is a lot of um you know if if property has been on the market for you know 120 days or more then send messages so there's a huge cold there's a cold email cold DM campaign um that you can do and then there's obviously the whole social audience building content thing where it's like so many people have heard of seller financing but they just don't know how to do it or they might not know what it is let me show you a graph I'm going to show you this graph and it's one of those graphs where when I when I when I see it it's just it's beautiful so I'm going to share my screen whenever I I I find an idea I always um check Google Trends so I check Google trends for seller financing the interest over time and it's just it's really just going up and up and up um it's it's something that is you know more and more top of mine look at that from you know November it's beautiful you know you don't get you don't see this this is a gift you have a gift um yeah that's right around the time that interest rates went up and so um it this makes total sense to me so you can focus on different regions that are looking at it the most it looks like Utah Arizona Hawaii Florida not surprisingly uh Florida um you know I know there's a lot of selling over there right now um so that's something I would do is think about how do you target the the geographies that want this the most um and then building content around these queries right so like Niche content SEO um this is something that you know it'll it'll get your customer acquisition on autopilot you just build these Niche Pages you do some cold DMS content around it this is like a great idea yeah and and you know what I like about this so much versus like my my sip versus spit of the other one the other the other last idea was like there's so many things that need to go right for this to work you know it's a marketplace right you need a demand and Supply you need liquidity but with this you don't need that much to go right um it's quite validated we've checked on Google Trends this is a good idea and I hope you do it awesome well thank you so much I really appreciate the feedback of course thanks for coming up send it when it's live we're ready to absolutely we'll [Music] do you know we're going to add to the stage right now it's time you know you know what time it is it's Leo time it's Leo time no it's not Leo time no we no it's cool it's and I'm I'm excited to talk to Leo because I've actually chatted with Leo on Instagram and and so it it's it's tough it's tough but it's not listen sometimes sometimes it's not Leo time and sometimes it's Leo time and right now because you're in here twice Leo and right now it's it's not Leo time I mean we could add Let's see we added double Leo Leo chat say something oh yeah you can hear me problem we got audio Leo and buy myself a Lut ticket I apologize apologize to you and the audience I did everything I could I downloaded the app but for some reason but I'm so thankful to be speaking with you both uh Greg you're a true inspiration I'm a huge fan of yours and thank you so much again for giving me this time of course so hard to pitch after the previous uh uh bu startup idea which was brilliant I'm I'm mine is nothing compared to ours no come on come on first of all Leo tell people who you are yeah the people need to know uh um my first name is agil my middle name is Leo my last name is abim I grew up in Montreal uh so I am a keca and um I practice law and I'm also a musician I'm a professional touring musician amazing and what's your idea um so it's been a while I've been thinking I've been looking for a way to stop exchanging my time for money and um to a large part thanks to you Greg like I said you've inspired me so much so I've been thinking I've come up with this it's not a a new uh I'm sure it's it's not a new idea it's been there um subscription based legal slm marketing SL Media Services cater to creators you know given the growth of the Creator economy and the fact that legal services are not accessible to everyone because because mainly uh of the cost um I thought you know I would create a subscription-based business where I would provide value in educational material to creators to artists I mean it could be it could be niched down and focused on for example musicians or creators in general YouTubers influencers and provide with them because many of these creators um don't have the the knowledge uh when it comes to intellectual property and the fact that these are assets and then these assets are capable of creating long-term income recurring income and so basically making them aware of of this opportunity I think it's valuable and you would you know price you would also include like educational material on taxes business formation um branding I mean you could focus on one thing or you could just offer a number of services and you know to to provide Great Value you would even throw in you know a 50% off uh trademark application for a 12 month with a 12- month subscription to the service then you would have access to all these online classes weekly um legal information sessions weekly business uh coaching group coaching so this is a not in a nutshel d idea J Mi you want to give your opinion I I'm curious you gotta Niche it gotta Niche down all the way no marketing none of that what what's your what's like your superpower in law so I'm I practice entertainment law more specifically music law sweet I also have my firm also does have a a an immigration practice tailored towards entrepreneurs and artists so I loved the uh trademark SL patent that offering for a subscription service I think is really unique I I like that a lot um because that's a very daunting activity to for Crea and someone who you know they want to feel protected but it's a great way to retain um a client and yeah I would just like hyperfocus on a the law Niche and B offering like I'm a big fan of this like help desk type model right now for like membership communities um where it's like four 500 a month or whatever you get access to a Leo chat bot plus Leo in uh like Community or membership model so I think that could work here but I would say Niche down on Law plus um your superpower so thank you legal practices still it's crazy to say this but in 2024 still don't understand the world we live in in terms of customer acquisition product I Services niching down uh like what what every Creator does just from like a funnel perspective um workshops uh you know all these things they don't do so I think that there's tons of opportunity to build a a a new legal practice or a legal practice that has that does what we do in mind um I agree that like there needs to be a niche and it you know I think for you I think what it could end up being is you have like multiple front doors so you have your like immigration front door you have your uh entertainment front door you have your creator front door I think for you I would think about who's G to pay the most and who's most willing to put the money out you know musicians for example maybe lesso creators maybe medium but immigration is more of like a immigration and trademarks and IP is more of a need to have so I would probably start with like from a prompt perspective think about who who needs this the most and then what can I borrow from just people in our world in the Creator spaces like the Shan pories the mes the S pars the you know all these people and build funnels um because there's so much you can do in terms of customer acquisition that you'll be able to you know acquire customers like I actually was talking to um a big firm the other day and they wanted to a top firm I don't want to name them but they you know I was shocked to hear how big of a budget they have for travel and entertainment and events and although that's you know and sponsorships actually just like sponsoring you know local hockey teams and basketball and stuff like that so you're going to do so much better by audience building content organic YouTube AI assisted content uh cold DM cold email um and on then you know the icing on the cake is positioning that's actually going to resonate with creators or with your audience because when I go to insert Law Firm name here it all looks the same it all looks like a WordPress like old website with a lot of jargon on it so I think that's your opportunity and I think there's tremendous I have tremendous interest in in where law goes and how legal practice practices evolve um and I think there's there's you know this is like a multi1 million opportunity for for for someone who gets it right there was um Justin Khan I don't know if you remember Justin KH he's the co-founder of twitch twitch which sold to to Amazon for a billion he worked on something called Atrium and he was trying to reinvent the law firm but raised like 40 or $ 50 million seed round doing it um he had a lot of good thinking but I think there's an opportunity to do it Leo like producti service don't raise money um so anyways all that to say this is sip for me I love what you're doing Niche down and uh I think it'll be great thank you so much it means so much again I apologize for the technical issues of you don't have to thank you so much it was such a such a pleasure speaking with you both pleasure was ours pleasure was ours both both your video and your audio thank you post we could have just kept his uh audio here for this for what a legend measure um how you feeling how you feeling about these ideas before we get to the next person feeling pretty good got got mod yeah just special delivery uh from Courtney my wife so shout out Courtney for the model yeah absolutely that's awesome that was that treating you it's pretty yeah it's a special as they say oh wow it is Friday so why not all right so we're gonna we're going to get to it um we're going to bring uh on to the stage welcome welcome hello um yeah I don't think you're going to pick me so bit shock and then and then we picked you and then you know that's the way the world works yeah it's great thanks so much for having me this is really cool um our pleasure what's on your mind so um so my idea is kind of based on two experiences I had in previous jobs I worked in um so I worked in software engineering for a couple of years and then I decided to try working in operations so like just total internal business stuff um and I worked at a charity as well in operations and uh they had like basically nothing was automated that they did um like everything from like expenses to annual leave claiming Etc was just people passing emails around and [ __ ] like that um and I built something while I was there which was essentially all within Google workspace um and it was a annual leave management tool that basically like allowed you to just have buttons to click approve and stuff via email and it would just fill in a spreadsheet with like this calendar effect um on the spreadsheet um and the idea is like a lot of small companies like they don't want want to leave the stuff they know and there was nothing about this that was outside of what they already knew which was Google workspace um yeah so the idea being like a suite of HR tools where everything is just in Google workspace like yeah it's kind of like on the idea that people say like every sass is a spreadsheet but then if every sass is a spreadsheet then just keep it in the spreadsheet and maybe some people will like that um yeah what do you guys think jmx I'm trying to V I'm trying to visualize it uh yeah so like imagine like a Google form where uh people can put in like the dates they're going to they want to take off and like the code like the reason um as soon as they hit send they get a Gmail saying like their line manager gets a Gmail saying like do you want to approve this request they can press a approv button in the email and then in a in a Google sheet there's like there's like a each cell is like a date and it looks like a calendar and it will like fill in the right places uh based on like what they've selected basic yeah does that make more like visual sense yeah makes yeah it makes sense um and it's just for like PTO like vacations is it for specific industry I think that's that's the thing in my mind I don't really know like annual leave doesn't seem to be something that has a niche in my mind like every like maybe based on like company size or something but I have that thing of like how how do I find a niche for this and like a legitimate Niche not just saying I'm just going to pick something and gonna you know just say put the name on it what's your thoughts JX then I'll go next yeah I want to hear hear your thoughts I'm I'm having a hard time find and like that the application or like the like why I would want to look at a spreadsheet on of leave versus just like a calendar um and like what the value for me would be as like if I was the business owner so um yeah I'm confused could you could you can you convince him um so the value is like so what these companies are doing before is they're simply just like emailing each other saying please can you like please can I take these dates off the person has to kind of go to spreadsheet fill it all in somewhere where they're storing this information but this is all just connected now like it's all just kind of buttons that people can press and forms that people can fill in but they it's not like an external application where they have to train their staff on that new application yeah we've got like a shared calendar that we that we use and it works uh it works pretty well because people like put the like request date on there and then everyone can see that calendar and then it just like overlaps exactly with our with our calendar um so Jordan's out he's I'm SP for sure spting so here's here's what I gather from the idea when it comes to pto's and figuring out when someone's on and someone's off we've all had issues where oh my God I didn't realize that Jordan's going to be off next week and it completely derails our entire week and lot you know there's material impact to people who have PTO now Google Calendar or calendar Microsoft Outlook you know the Assumption there is that I'm looking in a calendar and the assumption is I'm seeing it I think that there's an opportunity to build an app that and when I say app I mean like web app I think there's an opportunity that just focuses on on solving the problem of we will inform your team like we are the best platform for letting you know when people are on and off so I think that for example you could do something like you know it's a slackbot that basically says Hey reminder uh uh you know Jordan's going to be off next week and it post to a public Channel like that in itself is super valuable because now it's being socialized that that person you know and no one likes to do that no one likes to be like oh hey reminder I'm gonna be off you know it's kind of like annoying so I think there's an opportunity to build like the PTO app just like that there was an opportunity to build um you know I'll show I'll show this business real quick um give me a second I'll share my screen so this business Lis this is for performance reviews this is like a multi-billion dollar company and it's just software around performance reviews comp cycle management Integrations there's some like AI stuff obviously team analytics like wouldn't it be cool to see analytics on like PTO and and who's taking it oh hey you're not taking PTO maybe you need a break you know I feel like that there's an opportunity to build like the lattice for PTO that's my sip idea for you based on what I heard so that's what I would love for you to think about uh over the weekend and you could integrate it with like slack like you said Greg or notion so it's like when you're planning projects and I go to tag Greg or Colin or whoever like it's like go that that's going to be pushed because he he's going to be out or whatever I think that that would be that would be super useful and you know oq in the chat wrote is PTO a small enough Niche it's a small it is a small enough Niche I don't I'm not sure that this like my here's my name for it for you pto.com nice and I think that there's an opportunity just to drive traffic to something called PTO pal by the way someone in the chat don't take it that's not the rules you can't do that you know we can't have that here this is a POS period startups are hard enough as it is we don't want that yeah so a little lock up period Aman gets 24 hours to uh to buy it if she wants and um but yeah I think that there's that's where the opportunity and uh thanks for coming up and uh I'll see you online thanks guys later thank you all right we're gonna bring up Alex and then Yer you are on dck hi how's it going Greg can you guys hear me Greg Jordan yeah I'm a big fan of the show so thank you guys very much I'm a fourth year university student uh from California I'm an undergrad in chemistry and I had this idea of starting a newsletter where we just share insights about just chemistry Science and Technology kind of related things um what I've been learning you know just through you know this is kind of my second career I worked in healthcare for like 10 years and then you know now I'm in chemistry so I'm about to graduate I'm finding out that um you know chemistry information is very it's like it's just a small small niche people who don't really share that with anybody else and I found that you know when I tell somebody else something some kind of insight that I have you know in regards to the toxicity of a product whether that be like a shampoo uh just any cleaning product or anything like that people are shocked as to how many carcinogens are out there um and just these kind of thing medicines how how they work and you know how they harm you or what not and so I thought about just a newsletter where you can share uh stuff like this right like you know scientific papers journals we talked about this on the show the other day and I've been thinking about this idea for at least I'd say a few months to a year and I I'm a college student right so don't know really how to structure a business or or even think about scaling or starting so I just kind of want to come on here and share my idea and see if you guys would roast it for me uh pushing me down the right track and as a non-technical person uh stuck in the very extreme of Sciences you know I just want to come on here and see if you guys can give me your advice and your thoughts J X beautiful I love super technical people that are diving in to to this world uh there's not enough and we we love to see it I think there's a yeah there's a huge opportunity have you seen live Oasis no live- oasis.com it's like a basically like a water toxin microplastic directory and I think there there could be an angle thank you Greg um there could be an angle here with like everyday everyday uh products and I just learned about like a Teflon coating I forget what what it was called yeah it's really bad for you yeah so like the paint like you could have a whole Niche around just like cooking pans I think uh right cutting boards and like maybe start yeah hyper niche in the kitchen right uh I could see that I could see that kitchen cancer I don't know that's a bad these kind of videos on social media that I I've seen I've come across on Tik Tok Instagram whatever they tend to get a lot of traffic and a lot of views a lot of Engagement because people are shocked at these kind of things and so when I talk to any of my other friends whether they're in law or you know other Industries they really have no idea you know as to what products in their day-to-day lives are carcinogens or affecting them or whatnot medicines or whatever maybe we talk about uh people are shocked every single time so I just thought there's so much value in information especially as Niche Niche down as I am in like chemistry biochemistry it gets really complicated so it's really nice to stand out and be one of those scientists who can communicate those things well because typically in science there's really not that good of communication right or entrepreneurship and you know we go to far length to study this kind of thing and we just don't share with anybody we publish papers and it just stays there you know sometimes we do research for 10 years on one medicine and then just move on you know what I mean and and there's so much value for other people to be had from sharing this kind of stuff that I just thought free newsletter you know just post about it somewhere on on the social media platform hopefully you know uh get people interested and you know just start sharing information and monetization I have no idea maybe Partnerships you know sponsorships and you know ad rep Revenue through it through um I don't know it could be medicin medicine companies healthcare companies biotech companies anything like that but anyways that's my idea um you know let me know what you guys think so in the kitchen agreed I think you you do short form and it's really you're kind of selling fear in a lot of ways it's like did you know that there's 1.2 billion you know particles of plastic on and then you like show it and you're actually really good on camera like I feel like this is a Tik Tok right now like I feel you know like I see tons of them every day and I just feel like you know the more far down you are into the science the more kind of nerdy you are and the worse you are at posting content but that's why I thought writing would be a little bit easier for me to get into because as scientist you're not really a content creator you know and as as much as you can do it I think riding would be the Le the least passive resistance you know what I mean but I I hear you but I think that with writing in a newsletter for example you're not going to like you need top of the funnel and the top of the funnel is going to come from short form I think they need a lot I think you need a lean into I'm a scientist and let me tell you something like lean into I'm smarter than you and uh milky nky TV in the comment section wrote uh like Bobby approv approved and so Bobby approved right I don't know if you know him but know yeah yeah and so my sorry go ahead Greg his uh you know for for f folks who don't know who he is he's I think his Tik Tok handle is flave City flave and he goes around to Costco and Publix and Florida and ALDI and all these grocery chains and he picks up regular products and he says it's like you think that this is a good product and let me tell you why it's not a good product or right and here's something else that you know you buy cornflakes you shouldn't buy cornflakes because there's processed sugar and there's this and there's that and there's orange 12 which is banned in the US let me tell you you know you should be buying um this and Aldi's own brand of corn flakes actually has three ingredients and then what he's done is he's created a directory called Bobby approved this is Bobby approved and the guy is making millions of dollars a year right I had a friend come to me exactly like this and he asked me the same exact thing he was a retired attorney and he told me like like Alex give me your opinion on this and he shows me the video of Bobby and I'm like this guy is incredible he's really niched down and he got you know all these you know people who are maybe retired stay at home moms or this kind of crowd that really follows him and goes to Costco and looks at these products I thought that was amazing and so I think the the more credibility you can apply to that the better and I think I I was just thinking about you know my leverage as a scientist to be able to really really get down into the science of things and really explain things really well and from my experience in healthcare people want to know you know how how those medicines are toxic right like you if you take something today you want to know what what potential you know harm that can do or you know little things like this but I I totally agree that social media should be top of the funnel and so uh given the circumstances we have now with Tik Tok and Instagram and the kind of it might be going on off the you know it might be shutting down what do you think where to start you know I me now beauty is vertical video you know so it doesn't matter if Tik Tok shuts down because what you create for short form you know you can put on Instagram reals you can put on YouTube shorts and you can put on Tik Tok if Tik Tok no longer exists then it doesn't matter like you just put on you'll be putting on reals and shorts so I think that if I'm you I'm spending the next four months and be and or four or six months and be like how do I become the best possible um Authority in the niche in this in this and and and learn about how to be amazing at short form video and just watching a bunch of short form video taking notes um I do think that there's a bigger like the macro trend is really Bobby approv for X so for people listening who you know Alex has a specific Bobby approv for ex that he's working on but there's probably like aund ideas where you could go up and basically have taste and have curation and have technical analysis create a point of view and then send them to to a directory like that's the idea but for you specifically I think in you know in in the kitchen Nob brainer this is an idea that's GNA work I look forward to seeing what happens it's got some built-in virality I think we got to do the first one this weekend I want the lab Cod I want you to print out the peer review paper it's so boring you're gonna hold it up rip it in half be like I read this so you don't have to and then exactly much right into it and this is what I do fun anyway on my free time let's see it exactly all right thank you guys so much for having me on you guys have to start a community more like this all the time I would totally a th% join um I watch all your videos so I I appreciate you guys coming on here and helping us out well we do have a a community it's called Community empire.com uh for those interested that's right right and uh we do do jams like this we had one yesterday where we were just jamming on ideas so um check it out um and there's also a free you could just sign up to the free course as well so it's there's a free five day email course thanks a lot Alex doe thanks you guys so much all righty you know what time it is what is it the gajer time let's go let's go he's been in the queue too he's been in the queue but his his video wasn't showing so it wasn't yeah I I was keeping my video off but hi Greg hi Jordan how are you guys great good nice to see you here thank you uh and uh it really means a lot for me to be here as well because it's 2:30 a.m. in India yes so I've already I've already I've already so I've already come across your post link post of having these kind of chats and I found them super useful but then I always looked at the Times Z the EST I'm like oh no not going to happen but uh I was awake today and another post I think perfect back on so let me just quickly introduce myself right so I'm from India I just like Leo I have also started law so I'm a business in law graduate I've graduated this year I'm 23 years old and I am building a startup which basically uh makes learning fun so just to give you a bit of background in India so all the education which I have been through I have personally found it very boring and found it very monotonous because in India at least the high schools focus on Dr learning so what I've decided that I'll be focusing on 21st century skills with games so for an example I've created this game which is a board game just like Monopoly so it's a two to two to four player board game it's called startup high and uh what it is based on is the fundamentals of an entrepreneurial mindset so now what what I want to do eventually is I want to take this game and many many more games like this into schools tell them that okay uh I I I I don't think books are useful anymore anymore any longer take this board game give an experiential give a game based give a peer-to-peer learning opportunity and access to students so that they can actually learn 21st century skills which is much needed I think in today's world and then uh lead on irrespec of whether you want to be an entrepreneural respective whatever they want to be I think being problem solving being opportunistic being risk- taking are important things which everyone needs to learn so yes looking for your opinion your ideas everything right it JX that's really cool I love that we got to see though we gotta do you have a website up for it uh the website is under construction but I think uh what do you want to see I can redirect you different fures for that oh yeah just like would love to see the game the pieces it's cool that you've already got a physical game made um thank you so love that I I do I do have a YouTube channel where which I put on the trailer and a couple of more things regarding the video uh I would I would also recommend you to check the trailer out if you are uh if you like cinematic pieces I've tried my best to make a cinematic trailer of this uh should I just uh tell you the YouTube channel yeah sure yeah or'll drop it in the chat after sure I'll do that cool um yeah I really like it I mean my mind immediately goes like how do you get this digitized as soon as possible um yeah what is the digital version of it just from a so a shareability perspective correct so but I think so there are two pins there are two thought processes of M regarding digital version so one is so the industry which I'm targeting is actually edutainment which is basically Education Plus entertainment right why I'm not bullish on digital three reasons one I'm not a tech person the uh I find edtech or education technology has actually you know done more harm than good for sure it has uh democratized education but I think people actually need to get back to peer-to-peer learning get back to off screen learning for some time in in the in the curriculum and then go ahead but of course I do realize technology I think is a great distributor uh and uh it democratizes a lot of information so I think uh I am working on a tech version but I think it will slightly take much more longer time than expected so for for the next three four months at least focusing only on the offline version offline based learning yeah I love that um I love the the mission behind that I think I would think about how to design in yo I would think about how to design in uh like the IRL URL uh Bridge basically like how do you get peer-to-peer learning your time in you can earn points digitally and almost like tamagachi throwing back the Nostalgia like little kids had to keep these like digital Pets Alive or like the Farmville craze I think there's a big opportunity to actually like create a secondary world around startups entrepreneurship you know a lot of people want to entrepreneurship so I don't recommend it but if you want to play it would be cool to be able to to to play and build up like Equity or you know coins or whatever I don't know what you guys think about that I think I think you know the what excites me about what you're doing is there's a huge percentage of parents that want their kids to be entrepreneurs and there's no good ways for them to like there's no there's not enough structure there's not enough product structures for them to go and become entrepreneurs so I think there's like a big holding company opportunity to basically you know you're starting with a board game but I think having a suite of products that inspire people to become business owners if you can make that there's tons of search volume for entrepreneur game for XYZ too actually um it looks like Amazon ranks what I would do is build like launch on Amazon and then you could do build links to the Amazon URL because an Amazon URL already ranks you can probably uh dislodge that and replace yourself with it um is what I've seen occur in the past um and then uh you can Target parents that are business owners that have uh kids under the age of 18 on Facebook with Facebook ads and then it's just a creative game of like you know how do you how do you get but that targeting is super easy to do you can also buy those email addresses of people too you you probably C email people this of like like make your kid into an entrepreneur um but you can buy parent email addresses lead lists like and then it's just like you know C I think it would probably make more sense on social like I feel like social is going to be the way that I would do this and go and find like Mommy influencers uh like um uh and like kind of that whole category and then do like Partnerships with them of uh you know like here's this game that teaches your kid the skill sets and what I would try to do is like tap into another uh like game that people know to it's like you know mon Monopoly was actually created to like teach people how land like yeah exactly capitalism right like like how landlords exist um but what I would say is be like hey we're the Monopoly for the 20 you know for the 20 for 2020 for the 21st century or whatever right um so it's like basically taking this old idea that people already have a connection with or what I would actually position it as is like were the Monopoly for the internet age something like that and then basically the game teaches them how to like you know whatever like build internet-based companies in this whole new paradigm um yeah I mean that there's your your whole go to market strategy is pro probably somewhere in that but interesting I think uh lots of interesting points here uh by the way Jordan if you want to look at the website you can still I don't think it's complete but it's startup high.in so you can just check that out I think you'll find the trailer there cool well we'll check it out but I think that's like that's the big idea look at look at search volume build multiple products I think you'll have physical ones digital ones and I I I I see you know it's validated right so we love to build things where it's validated that's a validated thing so we'll keep an eye out for it thanks for coming up perfect thank you so much guys what are you sipping on Cody dude I've been drinking coffee all day I'm about to go get a gen and tonic though if you if if we uh should we do that you guys you guys you guys on I'll I'll go get a get okayed what you're fine you're you're crushing it okay cool I thought it was a little delayed I didn't know if it was streamyard I'll be right back whatever what is everyone uh what is everyone in the in the Stream sipping on what are people sipping on I mean what are people sipping on something surely something if if Cody Schneider's getting a g&t you certainly should get something um I think that what we'll do for the rest of the stream is um I think I'm just gonna I'm gonna jam with Cody for a bit and then we're gonna head out dope um and and I just want to see what's on Cody's mind right now um but while while we're waiting let's bring uh meat is that your real name you're on you're on mute meet just a sec yes sir yes I was uh my name is meat it's meat Shukla oh beautiful yes welcome to the stage do you have an idea for us uh so it's not an idea I W I'm currently working on a product which I think is dying down I am probably going to switch or pivot it a bit but uh so the thing is that I'm basically a software developer right now in otwa very near to you Greg yeah uh and so I'm trying to I just graduated from master's degree right now and so trying to build this product night and like on nights and weekends so this is my first prod like first try at building a product from scratch so it's called clip. it's basically a tool for creators to sell digital downloads and also sell their time so as in like a calendly alternative within the product itself I know it's I was just building it for like learning and stuff but tried to convert it into product so it thought it was a huge Market that's why I converted into a product and I just wanted to know if you guys have some growth tactics or what things I could do in to get few of the initial users or it's how do I spell that K Li i p p. I well that's your first problem the the double P the K and the double p and you know I think uh it's hard to spell but let's see what we can do all right so I've got it live here best fit for modern creators and entrepreneurs launch your digital store in five minutes so digital products schedule meetings offer coaching solidate links in your link and bio store interesting so who do you compete against so yeah we are competing against Str store and that's why they're doing 20 million ARR and they're a VC baged company so we thought that we can maybe take a cut of the pie but uh that's not really happening I tried to DM like about, people on Tik Tok and Instagram but they're really very much Affiliated like they're not even earning money the creators who are using Str store and then also they're trying to they're like wannab be wnab be creators and so they're only following the creators who are already bigger than them and all of them are using stren store so I'm not sure if I can get those creators but they don't have a lot of users on Twitter and Linkedin EXT store themselves so I was maybe thinking to Target soloers and like Sol side of Twitter and Linkedin okay and let's check out Stan store like from a features perspective are you like very similar would you say I think I I have about 70% of the feature watch 10 store has But but so like why would someone ask actually use you versus stand store if you have 7 that you right like you're right on that part like I am also not able to answer that question to be are you honest so that's why you know what it is don't compete in these markets like yeah why do people do this to themselves you know it's like you're didn't Stan raise like [ __ ] 20 million in their last round too yeah um [ __ ] h yeah yeah it's too much work for you dud like you should focus this energy somewhere else what's the most valuable part of this how can you abstract that out into like another place um is it like the the payment process I again I don't know I sorry I'm coming in late I was like trying to find my cabinet so to be very honest it didn't took a lot of development effort like because I've been a developer since like last three four years so it just took me two months to develop so it's not too much of developing effort but and I was very new to like next St and stuff so like that's why it took a little bit of time but otherwise it would take only a month to bit so not core value too much in development but it's like I thought like doing all of the parts of digital products and scheding which a lot of creators use newsletter a lot of creators use Ken Le for their scheding part sell digital products so merging all of them inside one two what's a niche you can go after that they're not going after that's a great that was my next question so like convert kit as an example like they were competing against mail champ how' they win is because they went after bloggers and they were underserved and they built products that were specific for them it's like that same idea like basically at you know picking a subset that's under ser and this is the hardest part of this what you're doing right is like and with like a stand store the problem too is like you're competing against like they're just going to go hire influencers to promote the tool and then other influencers are going to see the tool and then it's just like it's going to create this like so the thing is I talked to one of the creators who is on stand store and they are paying like $500 a month to those creators yeah just to put videos on I can't compete against that yeah I can't compete against that yeah um so that's why I thought that maybe I can go on Twitter and lingon and solo preneur on that thing on on whole that Niche because I don't think a lot of people on Twitter also knows of St store itself totally um hold on I gotta find this company I have an idea for you um and I think you could go after coaches doing this uh practi have you seen practice no I haven't seen so sorry I'm in some like LinkedIn growth pod [ __ ] with this person so I gotta go find whatever it is here it is okay I invested in this business a16 zbed like it's just you don't really want to compete against these types of businesses you know so hard yeah um coach boox doai here I'll drop it in the YouTube I got it I'll share my screen coach boxit AI yeah and they build if I understand correctly I still them confused like their [ __ ] positioning on their website is very confusing but um what I believe they do is they make like a digital chatbot for like coaches and creators for their think character AI but like for a business like coach right or like a you know mental health coach or a fitness coach or whatever um they basically like take all of that person's knowledge and then they build like a digital version of them that people can pay to access um I think that there's something probably in here with like what you've built and then also this um and then your you know your go to market is just like go sell coaches on making a digital version of them because that what you're doing is you're creating a new Revenue stream for them right and then you take a rake off of the subscription service is like how I believe it structured so it's like you're I mean she's paying like 99 but I I mean probably how I would do it is I would go and like train a model like make like a what is it called like Lenny bot have you seen this grg yeah I think exactly make like a lenot um is it Lenny bot.com or doco yeah.com here I'll drop it in the chat too um and I would do basically like that but for coaches or creators with all their knowledge and then they get to charge Their audience for access to them or if they're just like already a coaching because like when you think about coaches right like what do they do they build all this top of funnel and then there's you know probably 90% of the people don't actually buy from them they're just like consuming their free content and then 10% turn into actual paying you know it's probably even less like we should have a coach on at some point to talk about this Greg have a coach on at some point to talk about their unit economics that would be super interesting um but the uh the that whole other set like what the the the product offering or how you could go to market with it to get the positioning right is like you have this whole group of people that you're not you you will never actively coach they will never pay for coaching but you could still monetize them with a tool like this um that's at a way cheaper price point so they get like you know we'll say 70% of the effectiveness of the coaching or 50% of the effectiveness of the coaching um but it's just uh like you know at a way cheaper cost you know a tenth of the cost of what the coaching is and like I think that that's an upsell this this idea is the same idea as the uh uh the AI like voice chat Bots that people are starting to like employ out for like car dealerships and [ __ ] their angle of how they're getting into car dealerships is like yo when your team is offline like it's like you know 9 pm at night and somebody calls you instead of going to voicemail we're gonna answer this and it doesn't have to be as good as the person that is in the daytime right it just has to be good enough of what's currently happening which is no one so it's of course it's G to be good enough so even if it you know increases Revenue just a small percentage it's that same idea so it's like you can basically you make a new Revenue stream for them that uh they otherwise couldn't have off of the audience they already have it's just like they deploy it so anyway just a thought but and then and then you can charge monthly yearly for it or even do a REV share so you can give people the option yeah free tier with a REV share and then like a teachable has great pricing like this where it's like yes yeah it's like I think it's 10% transaction fee if you're on that free and then Bas you know bump up so sorry Greg didn't mean to cut you yeah no no teachable is like they crush it here yeah they're so good at this um yeah so what is that $1 and 10% Like think about that like that's insane right so it's like of course I'm GNA buy the 39 or go up all all the way to the 199 yeah you know and if they're a legit coach like I'm just thinking about some of these like marketing coaches like like a [ __ ] Amy Porterfield or something like that um that's charging whatever I don't even know her number anymore it's like, 1500 an hour or something like insane um like if they can go and right and somebody can subscribe to her thing for $29 think about a hundred thou I mean she's got a top whatever you know top one marketing podcast in the US right like I mean she's going to sell 100,000 of those and of course she'll pay you you know whatever 99 a month to be able to have that chatot live that people can interact with I think it's gonna be the weird part is going to be figuring out how do you get them to like coach you know it's like hey this is a you know and and it's based off of the source material so you build this whole Corpus of information of their knowledge you know C and then and then that's like transferred into the chatbot and like acts like them talks like them uses the vocabulary like them so it sounds like them it feels like them but I mean again I I I know a little bit about the space just with the typee of product I own and and I I think that there's a huge opportunity for this so okay yeah it was great thank you thank you so much guys hell yeah brother good luck man good luck go get him I removed myself hell yeah honestly I I felt you know I felt you feel bad for that you know people like that right like they spend a bunch of time I know he just says two months but it's just like the energy into something and then you realize like you're competing against behemoths but here's the thing you can still it's still like not wasted time right because if he just niches it you know sort of pivots and niches down he's got something totally totally also the St store founder is like a [ __ ] gangster like I wouldn't want to compete against him like zero% chance have you seen his YouTube it's absolutely popping off yeah yeah didn't he come from a Wall Street too yeah I think he was IB before this um which is like I mean they just know how to crush content they're used crazy hours right yeah exactly it's like 100 hours minimum 100% it's like dude this is nothing I'm doing 70 hour nothing yeah exactly that's a that's a chill work week for me exactly that's a long weekend work week for me yeah and Bob's not breathing down my neck at midnight I don't have Stacy texting me at 2 am and expecting a response in 15 minutes dude I had a roommate like that it's like it was like you had a 15minute rule like you had to respond in 15 minutes if a superior reached out yeah they'll just dip out like we're at dinner just they're gone 100% And what's terrible is like I feel like they just did it to like Lord power over people you know it was like it was like oh like he let's see if he's up at 1:00 a.m. like they're like out with their boys getting a [ __ ] drink and they're just gonna like hit up hit up Jack and be like oh you up like you got to do this perspectives right now PowerPoint better be loaded exactly man I I invited a couple more people before we head out one I just I just had to I don't even know what this means med school in a weekend like oh that's sick I'm so down you know that's the thing the pitches that work like you know because now I I'm getting like 100 DM you know 75 DMS right totally just say it in like five words you know what I mean totally totally and like have it be like a hook like like that right like what do you mean med school in a weekend like IM totally totally impossible no what do you mean med school is four years totally four hour surgeon four hour surgeon four hour surgeon all right are you the med school in a weekend guy yeah exactly hell yeah Hy you you look like med school on the weekend and I mean that as a compliment thank you so this is just like a half bed idea I just saw your live and it just came up something we are here for half aake ideas for Half Baked ideas okay so yeah I'm a finally a medical student so the the idea is like right now A lot of people are hyped about hubman optimization running clubs peptides stem cells everything all the good things so but not everyone like understands like the basic like physiology and Anatomy about all the things so the idea is to create like a course called med school in a weekend where I just go through the whole med school curriculum very basic very simple so people can like get an idea what everyone is talking about like so you understand what hman is actually saying in three and a half hours oh super interesting yeah this is a lock for me it's a lock dude yeah this ising look up [ __ ] background you don't see our screens right now but we're all doing research yeah this is a lock this is a lock and a half so so the thing is I have to think about how to get like traffic to the site so essentially I thinking in the beginning I need some like probably need some testimonials for like some repal people in the beginning maybe the codes the Gregs this is a social play so this is a social clip play of like you have some hook and use hubman I would just you literally show huberman like hubman said this on the last podcast right and it's like some [ __ ] art you know esoteric [ __ ] that nobody knows what it is and coming exactly exactly and then you're like you're like let me know like like uh like let me let me explain to you in plain English what this is and then it's like boom you just go into it or like I would probably you need to probably add some social proof there so it' be like I'm I'm a fifth year med student let me explain to you what this means boom and then it drops right into that and then that's top of funnel and then you just lead them into you know it's the classic you know Community to you know whatever whatever Greg's Playbook is now to like drip them down into to uh to this thing I me you could probably just send them right to the course and then run remarketing and that type of thing but what your guys thoughts yeah I think uh yeah audience Community product right it's simple short form top um I think that the name itself is VI is just viral like it it it it creates curiosity and Intrigue so somehow the domain's available so get it someone I said a domain that was available before and someone took it I think so get it like right now I don't know why you're listening to us right now like I have my assistant right brother oh you have an assistant literally by the domain like right now some [ __ ] will go do it it's there's too many people here not did that on this it's probably happening right now I know I know I was like don't do this yeah so rules exactly yeah I think uh what what are you GNA charge for something like this yeah that's the question my my now I'm just ripping right now so I'm thinking we know you're ripping we've known you for two minutes you have you have nothing but a domain now yeah let's go so so I'm thinking like you can begin like lower in the market start with like Twitter Instagram Etc then you can take that as a lower tier course I don't know like $49 or something then you can buy up some traction more way more five $4.99 at least start with that you know how much med school costs B one I live I live in Denmark it's free no what do you mean no no you live in New York City now and med school cost $400,000 yeah okay and that's on the website you put med school for you know Columbia University $400,000 with a bar chart and then you say med school 499.99 yeah but but the Years start with like yeah maybe go higher in price and then and you can use there will be more trust sorry this is a psychological thing the higher the price the course is hell yeah I love carlburg you got green cans right now let's go um yeah the higher the price is the more trust is built into it so if you actually go lower it's going to negatively affect the sales that you get like every course I've ever helped people sell I don't sell courses because it's a rule um but every course that I've ever helped people sell uh it we've increased price and only seing conversion increase over time so it's it's you can start at a course maybe higher price and then when you build up some traction you can do another course a bit more advanced and you consider to like people who are Premed nurses Pas people who want to med school or nursing school and then you can build up some traction there get some testimonials and then try to roll out to high schools maybe I Consulting for this company forever ago um they did like certifications like career certifications um dude they printed money and it was literally just an online course business like they had to get actual CER you know CER like certified at a government level um but a lot of the times if you're a practitioner you can go and get that super easily like that that we're going to teach this course and this is a cuu or whatever but like it was a requirement to get into nursing school right and then all they did was just a Content play for like top a funnel down into this like you're this company you know the first version is you sell through this hubman thing we're talking about but it probably evolves into that where it's like oh this is a career certification for the medical industry type of company right um yeah I mean that's that that there is like a 50 million to100 million a year business when you get it when you get it get out of here get out of here you you've got one want in I can I can send it to you the first version Oh I would love to see it we love we love when people actually ship on this stuff the time nobody does anything so don't don't be an idea guy be a product guy entrepreneur even though I have one in my Name by entrepreneur all right man get out of here go build get you and your assistant get your who is this guy it's his brother my brother yeah we have the same name almost amazing per are you in mid school too I go to law school even better weekend I mean what are we doing franchise dude Law School in a weekend is so such a good idea pay for business law school in a weekend totally all of us Entre I literally have a business law book that's sitting in my library and like I haven't touched it in three years and like it's the [ __ ] most dense [ __ ] ever just tell me the [ __ ] exploits I can use in business like that's all I want yeah let's go thank you guys later yeah good luck man nice to meet you guys all right we uh we're gonna do one more we do one more one last [ __ ] that's such a good idea fck that was a good that was a good one he's good I like the energy I like that young energy too that was cool the assistant just brother yeah lawyer Love It O Henry in the house oh awesome I was literally working and this is the first live one I listened to I was like oh [ __ ] I'll see if I can get on deck and you're here sweet um so my idea i' started started working on this a little bit before I got derailed is um I have been watching a whole bunch of people I know go through retirement so my dad is tell me what it is I'll tell you how to sell it I'm already in all right all right all right so uh my parents relatively low income I'm the first one for my family to go through college and all that and I've been watching my parents go through retirement and it's a total [ __ ] show now I'm in banking and finance and you know my buddy who got me in is turning 65 he's retiring in through three weeks he was telling me it's been a total [ __ ] show for him and you know he makes six figures good money so like okay this is [ __ ] the American retirement system is just totally backwards so I started playing around on this idea of a retirement concierge um is all the white color jobs are getting replaced with AI so I was training a chatbot in chat GPT and I was able to replicate the advice that my banker friend and my par parents were getting that they are paying 2 3K for meeting with retirement advisers and you know I could do it in 8 minutes sticking around and chat GPT with a bot that I had built what would they call that retirement planning like what how would somebody search for this online like our name so when you look for retirement Finance advice really you're kind of going against Forbes Investopedia things of that nature um there is sorry guys I haven't worked on this in like a month so I'm not Super Fresh perfect um there there is um Medicare cones something like that that is what could really print but I think you do need to have licensed Medicare people on your team Medicare agent I did Consulting for a company that was a CRM for Medicare agents you do it's kind of a [ __ ] it's also just you're [ __ ] with the government it sucks I would not do it again yeah um so that was kind of that was one of the ideas of what you could Branch into but the the starting MVP would be this retirement coner so create a bunch of content around retirement is your free lead magnet although that's kind of hard with Google's latest update but you know uh let's call it a 100 bucks 120 bucks a year for people it's like 10 bucks a month for people turning 65 and it'll run you through the a toz of retirement I had it print out retirement plans kind of check that with people I know you know you'll go through your assets and it'll kind of like it's not supposed to advise you they say chat GPT cannot give you Financial advice but it totally will so I can get it to work you can get llama to do this too if you just like an open source model will 100% do this as well so that's what I thought yeah all right I'm looking at keywords right now like retirement or dentist retirement planning retirement income planning Orlando like there's just thousands of these keywords related to this yeah if I were you I would be building like dentist retirement a.com yeah you know doctor retirement ai.com lawyer I think he's trying to go broader though those people that can't afford a r like a traditional um a traditional like Financial what what they call this person a retirement would it be a financial adviser like how would somebody search this right yeah yeah that that's kind of what I'm struggling with is for so many people it is the financial aspect but it will give you legal advice it will give you medical advice just as good as basically 80 retirement planning that looks like it's what it is um here hold on I can give you the keyword volume give me one second uh I wonder if you start like even like younger when you're like buying life insurance yeah so it's a cross sell that's happening at the agent level because then you can use them they're like an affiliate then they're all they're already used to selling these packages too that's all they do that's how they which sucks that's the only problem yeah you know I think you can do kind of like an affiliate thing like okay you're through this step now you're at the choose your Medicare provider affiliate linkout to the top rated people um things of that nature oh you need oh so it's a lead gen tool for yeah you could do that um I had it given very advice you think so that Community like it's plus 60 to 65 and uh I mean I I ran these ads before they're so cheap and they'll click on anything it's insane um and then just do like a conversion campaign to them like this is totally exp like exploiting them but 100% um it can't be an app that will have trouble installing it it'll have to be like some type of form that they fill out on on mobile um and then that leads them kind of down into it I don't know how you do that honestly what I would probably do oh this would be super interesting is like get it into a like a text then it's like a text message thing and uh just use like twillo and that's how it initially happens so it's like they fill I was just looking at automations yesterday 100% um and then they can text the advisor like questions and [ __ ] um I was Pitch my friend's probably G to build this new company and it's basically that but uh for like a nutrition uh for like nutrition coaching I think it was actually after the call we had like two weeks ago Greg or whatever um but uh he's going to just do it over text message because that's how everybody wants to interact with this like they don't want to like it's just like a something that's built into every phone right so do you have to get consent for that because I thought there were some laws around Robo messaging no so if they fill out the form it can be a notification message like hey thanks for signing up for blah blah blah like you can text this number back at any point with questions and like your digital financial advisor you know digital retirement adviser will help like work with you or whatever um I don't know the financial regulation laws around this so that's the only thing um like the compliance piece what is it finra I can't remember that yeah do your own research on that I think that you guys remember Miss Cleo no okay Miss Cleo was a she made tens of millions of dollars and what she did was she she did advertisements like 1 1800 number for tarot card readings oh [ __ ] I do remember this okay so I wonder if there's an opportunity to create like the Miss Cleo for retirement using your idea Cody of like if texting is the new 1800 number like the mental model they understand and you're like what does that look like and you create these like videos around it and it's just a character that might connect a little more than just like retire.com I think that's and then it's just a sign up form I would do Facebook ads again to 60 to 64 probably um I can tell you how many people are in the US actually that are with that yes give me give me the info yeah yeah yeah that's why you're here Henry that's right you're here for the info yeah I got it to work phenomenally well and I was thinking about building traffic through topical Authority but then you know with the last like Google update it's like okay you're just going to get crushed by Forbes Investopedia so I think yeah marketing directly to that demographic if you're an app though like if you're a legitimate business you can can do well in these spaces still going after longtail keywords but it's like have a public business profile like some type of physical address that's how we're kind of hacking this right now is like make like make it real companies still rank with SEO content like at scale is what we're seeing like being kind of filter but Greg probably more data on that too is it's not to like you know kind of grift off that age group is that they do have a little bit of money but it's to help them just get that information without all the [ __ ] like I was having it make legal forms like that power of attorney easy there's five to six million people in the US between the age of 60 and 64 you can Target on Facebook right now and I bet you could do I mean I would just run a lead form you could probably spin up a WordPress website with like sign up to get free I don't know some some type of I don't know what the offer would be on that um because they're probably hesitant on AI I wouldn't even call it AI I would call it I think what you're saying the concierge that that positioning is super good um like maybe it's like financial planning concierge like something like that I had like 10 AI names I just I threw them all in the [ __ ] trash I was like people everyone who's over 60 is terrified of it but they would benefit tremendously from it it's just a PR dad in the bunker already I mean he's like he's down there um and then another marketing channel I was thinking of would be affiliate marketing with Millennials giving them like a lifetime Rev share if they sign their parents up you know every kid out there is like Jesus Christ dad let me just help you with this your parents never let you just you know like I don't know we're all in our late 30s early 40s or whatever you know you could walk your parents through this and you could get affiliate income from them being signed up and then eventually work towards like Tax Services I I find that a bit weird personally but it might work has no one else been in that position where your parents are struggling with someone like something technically and then you got account with your parents it's like you know Mom sign up to this you know with this link it's you're gonna love it I mean you know with Bitcoin the printer but I've seen her do [ __ ] on Facebook that's insane like I stuff I don't even know and I do this for a [Laughter] living or okay man I think the concierge the retire like calling it something like retirement concierge that domain is available but it's 15 grand that's not crazy that's not crazy I would do a variation of that and then you buy that so I bought retirees do online just to start I I would get get a. get a variation of that doc because all that age demo has a really like their trust is built into do domains totally um and then I would buy that domain as time goes on so you like do like you know uh I don't want to actually give this away but like retire retirement coner app.com or retirement concierge you know like something like that um and then you you can always go and buy that domain like nobody's gonna go spend 15 grand right now on this thing you know if you're gonna do the uh the Miss Cleo thing it's like Johnny the retirement concierge.com it's great yeah so it's like a name yeah like John the coner yeah some name that fits that Boomer demo that they're like I know a John I trust a John you know like whatever that is that like here let's look it up actually what's the most trustworthy boo Boomer name I'll have perplexity write them up for us um what do you guys think about productizing and service like that because I would love to put like lots of free information out there just like the the [ __ ] that you want to Google as you're coming up to retirement that is so hard I want there to be free information um but like what do you guys think is a fair price point for basically aggregating this information and pointing them in the right directions when I'm doing app [ __ ] like this I do free info that leads into some type of service that's like a repeat purchase because the customer lifetime value is insane on this right like great great company that does this is like flow the period tracking app I think they do like ovulation and all stuff too but they they put out like a ton of free content like it's actually an unbelievable like resource um but all that leads into is like they're just selling you you know a subscription to this $10 app or whatever um I think that that to me that's that's the angle where it's like okay you help a ton of people and then simultaneously you are also uh you know creating that sustainability with the the cash flow but here's what the other guys think okay and yeah Greg I get what you're saying with the name that kind of reminds me of um oh my God uh marketing Secrets book [ __ ] guy out of Idaho I can't remember his name but you know creating that charismatic character for them to align with yeah these are people who need a character you know the they need a character and it's going to the dot com's going to go away away like it's going to go a long way the character is going to it also just gives you opportunity to create interesting content and interesting creative around it um so I think that's that's the play and then yeah in terms of like pricing it I think it you know these are customers that could last 20 30 40 years right so it's just really about getting them in the system and then getting you know they don't churn too because they don't know how to so like once you're in their clv is crazy I got the most how do you think good oh good how do you think a customer like that would stay if the if it's to get them through retirement A to Z and then they hit retirement what is the appeal of saing staying with the service like that I think there's still financial planning right like I throughout that whole period and like maybe checkups or I I don't know well think about it you know Market goes down 10% and you know what does that mean for me you know I think that the whole goal is you you're going to build retirement with Johnny retirement concierge.com over this 10 years and it's like great congrats you've now graduated from Johnny the retirement concierge to like I'm Johnny your homie and you have any question about Finance this that or the other like I'm here for you and you've already pluged into their Fidelity and it's like yo don't worry the market will correct just send them inspirational quotes all right here's the most uh trustworthy Boomer names for you Michael James William Robert and John based off of all the data that we I just scraped you know it's funny the old uh kind of Rich Banker guy that I sat down and shot this idea with his name is Michael and he's retiring in two weeks so I might try to make him my avatar for this business because I know he's going to be bored as hell uh in the baby boomer generation 833 th000 men were named Michael very original uh I feel like William could rip to it means Resolute protector seven most popular Boomer name I kind of like Jeffrey Jeffrey could be cool too Jeffrey yeah isn't it the butler yeah exactly I'm thinking like ashes meets miss it needs to be above the butler though right like mentally it needs to be it needs to be like oh my I would trust my banker right so like it needs to be at that level because like a Jeffrey you're like oh [ __ ] do I want him touching my finances I don't know maybe I'm wrong but I'm just thinking about brand is so I'm I'm broke as [ __ ] I have a disabled wife and two young young kids um what is a way I could try to make this generate quickly would it be like a paid weit list kind of like a quiz like are you ready prod service producti service for sure um I would like that exact same marketing strategy we were talking about sending to that landing page and then like what you just did for your dad how do you turn that into like a Playbook that you can run with these people um I don't know what the pricing would be need to be Pro like for it to be even worth it for you it's probably 500 bucks and then it's like they have like a you have an add-on Subscription Service where it's like you know if you hundred bucks a month if you want to continue to do this and then you whatever you build you turn that into a piece of software um yeah damn I was thinking like $10 a month to make 120 a year but no man I would I would way more ESP there's a trust Factor that's built into it right like the higher you price it the more trust is going to be built into it it's finding that it's finding that Tipping Point of like what the average person can afford and what is you know it's like basically that threshold of what they'll pay um but like the higher you can go the more trust there will be probably with something like this so and that's true like with my parents example you know they paid you know two grand and they had to wait like a month to get a response and I just basically did that same thing in parallel and got the response in eight minutes yeah totally totally I mean okay so so you said they charge two grand so charge 20% of that so that's 400 yep and then do the digital version of it I would start local where you based out of like out of Seattle Seattle work that's a big enough demo I would go there locally um because then it's like they're like oh like and I would I would emphasize that like we you know it's like local this is Seattle you know I just I just do this digitally because you can tap into that and then there'll be a rollover effect into the greater Washington area you hit Spokane you know you go down to Portland you go to Boise Etc um so give them the full service for 500 basically like whatever the retirement questions are yeah something like that I think that could be I don't know the regulation on it that's the only thing like you probably need to be uh a certified financial adviser you sound really [ __ ] smart though I've seen people test for this in like two weeks just by cramming um so that could be a way to do it it's like literally just a test you have to do that's that's all it takes financial advisor in a weekend straight up yeah that's franchise awesome or I could partner with someone right because I know some financial advisers yep you could run it and they sign off on it I mean that could be the other side of this is the done for you service so you're the back end of these companies you go scrape every financial advisor in the US and then you're like yo we will do Financial plans for you for $199 a piece they already have the the inbound they're charging 2K they you know pay you 200 and they get a report back that's standardized that they then pass off to their client I mean that's that's the be way easier to do that by the way probably way easier to do that and honestly that's a really [ __ ] good company so careful it can we back up 10 10 seconds what was that Greg no I just said I just said that I would like if I were you it's way more difficult to do what you to build retire ease and build a brand and build you know there's so much there's so many unknowns with with actually just working direct with financial advisers and being like hey I'm going to make your job a lot easier you're already producing these reports I'm going to do it at 4% of the cost and I'm going to charge you like you're going to save money by doing this and I'm going to be your AI partner to to create beautiful looking AI assisted Financial reports and your clients are going to love it and they're going to stay longer and you and you just charge for it that to me is way easier okay I'm I'm going to go basically [ __ ] off the rest of my workday and workshop that as well there's 240,000 to 700 or 370,000 financial advisors in the US um yo DM me I'll get you all their emails if you want just just hit me up i' I'd be happy uh LinkedIn or IG uh LinkedIn probably IG is a Cess pool for me so um okay all his ex-girlfriends are just you know they're all there you don't have you can't air me out like that man all right awesome thank there's 106 there's 180,000 emails I'll get you 50,000 of them um actually there's less it's closer to right

one key thing that we see we see there that it's easy to build stuff but it's not easy to grow 99% of the makers can build stuff but only few can actually grow and sell and bring in customers most people actually fail right at the start they just don't get any traction at all like not even one sign up and here you can solve that problem and I think people are willing to pay for that

but within education I think there's a huge opportunity for AI tutoring like for AI tutoring for example like I just want to learn video editing I I I started skill I don't sit through a 50-hour course I just want to pingstone like Hey how do I do this I want them to hit me back really quickly I want to upload the video clip I edited and I want them to analyze it and then send me to the right places to improve it or tell me how to do it exactly so instant feedback I think is going to be a huge thing I think it's very difficult to probably pull that off but you could either do like a more General one you could do it for verticals like skill-based learning or language learning I could see that being a thing so I think there's just going to be a whole Trend around assistance but within education I think like a tutoring coach like I would love to just have one for all the things I'm working on

one key thing that we see we see there that it's easy to build stuff but it's not easy to grow 99% of the makers can build stuff but only few can actually grow and sell and bring in customers most people actually fail right at the start they just don't get any traction at all like not even one sign up and here you can solve that problem and I think people are willing to pay for that so that's where I think the best ideas are right now so this is the idea like find keyword with high traffic search for it if it doesn't have any directory on the first page of Google go and build [Music] it John Rush startup ideas podcast he's finally on he's a fellow idea junkie this guy is is pushing out I mean what you have 20 businesses now 24 yeah yeah yeah you've got John has 20 businesses that he's running $2 million ARR 10 million users that are B2B to see 100,000 plus users on B2B come on this guy is one of us welcome welcome my my friend good to have you yeah thanks for having me G all right so what is on your mind right now what sort of ideas and Trends um would you be willing to share with with our audience I see two Trends now so one trend is that uh there are more and more solar preneurs so there are a lot of people building a startup on the side like people who work at a corporate job and they build it on a weekend and evening and then there are people moving over to uh cost effective countries uh saving UPS some money and spending a year or two building out from there like uh it's called building p public or in the hackers on Twitter and this movement was very small like it was very few people like three two years ago but I think it's doubling every year like I don't have the count but my feeling that it's at least doubling and will keep growing uh just because we see that uh the access to building startups is really best ever like you don't have to fund raise anymore you don't have to find a co-founder you don't have to find a team you can can just do everything on your own either you just codee it if you're a coder or you use no code if you're not a coder so that's kind of the trend I see and then at the same time I see how this trend can be uh utilized or how how we can supply this trend and uh like my my personal role is pretty much to build the tools for for this crowd so that they are kind of more powerful with fewer resources and uh I think uh one key thing that we see we see there that it's easy to build stuff but it's not easy to grow like that's kind of like 99% of the makers can build stuff but only few can actually grow and sell and bring in customers so that's where I think the best ideas are right now like the low hanging fruits is building something around the uh the growth and the marketing and c and Tools around that yeah and people will pay for growth is the other thing that people don't talk about which is yeah you know if you're able to generate customers uh for a startup people are willing to basically share in the revenu you know it's a revenue split basically you know so I think that what sort of prompt could you give to people in terms of you know how do you come up with an idea for you know in the space I think the best way to come up with the idea is to start with how would you sell it so basically uh don't build stuff but just see what people are actually looking for and for example like I give precise examples from from my own Journey like I saw a lot of people asking about SE for example like people were asking how to get backlinks how to grow how to you know grow the demand rating Etc so when you see those requests usually you see people answering how to do it with like seven steps and some makers kind of like like that just you know they read the steps and they implement but since most makers now are actually busy like they have even full-time job or or their side project say they want to save time and then if you rub that little kind of list of actions into a tool I call that micras uh and it just does one thing uh but it doesn't clear it's clear what to expect and it's easy to recommend so like my my game plan is this like I want people to recommend my tool under those posts like if somebody asks like how to do X and then somebody comes there and says I did that using this tool and if tool just only does one thing then it's easy for the user to remember this tool and to recommend that tool comparing to the tools doing like a lot of things like that then is hard to remember exactly where it does you were telling me about a a startup idea you had around weight lists can you can you talk more about that yeah I think like it's really hard to start like I remember uh in old times it was kind of easy to start I thought it's like everybody has an idea I thought like all founders have tons of ideas and they just kind of need funding or people to implement those but now uh I see more and more people uh with the willingness to build something but they don't know what to build and usually they're just looking around for random stuff and they just kind of build that stuff and usually that fails because like you promote this you know build community first and then the audience then from audience you go to um to the to their needs and then to the product right and I had this idea that if someone actually does this job of coming up with ideas uh validating the ideas uh with the users and then collecting uh a weit list maybe collecting prepayments and then you have the whole thing like there's an idea there is there there like 100 people who want it maybe five paid for it then you have you know all the risks not all the risk but a lot of the risk is gone now and then if there is someone who can build stuff they could actually buy this little you know uh like rough draft it's like start draft you can you can call it right you can you buy the startup draft and you can build it and you go from one from there which is hey everyone if you're anything like me you've got a ton of design work that you need webites landing pages emails social assets you name it but you don't just want beautiful landing pages or beautiful websites you want the stuff that's going to convert you want this stuff that's going to actually drive value that's where design scientist.com comes in it's an agency that for one monthly price will do all your design work all your copy work all your engineering and do stuff that actually scales your Revenue you don't need a designer you need a design scientist let's go design scientist.com I liked it so much I invested in the business like I was surprised to see that most people actually fail right at the start they just don't get any traction at all like not even one sign up and here you can solve that problem and I think people are willing to pay for that I think people are willing to pay like my my economics there was that uh basically people would pay up to $1,000 for that and and if that works and there is some Word of Mouth people can pay like two or three or 5K for that just to save this you know first period uh they could Skip and it's it's pretty low cost to do this so uh one could just make a machine that does all the steps so the first step is coming up with idea and if that's kind of your whole value proposition coming up with ideas then it's easier to put that on scale and to come up with a lot of ideas just by doing things like research on keywords research on hot topics on Reddit on Twitter and Etc so there are a lot of tools for that and so you do one part of the job you come with ideas and then the second stage is that you validate the ideas using technical methods so uh you check their traffic on organic you you check uh the potential you check the free domains on do com Etc so you do this simple things and that can be automated you can actually make a little tool for yourself uh that automates this and then the uh stage number three is that uh you have to now validate with real people and to do that you create a weight list and you promote the weight list using uh either ads or you pay influencers I actually like to pay influencers more than the ads because uh it's just cheaper like from my experience it was like you can pay $300 and have 100K views on the post uh now on Twitter so and you do that and then eventually like if if your pipeline is 100 ideas coming at the beginning and then uh like 30 ideas go to the next stage after this now technical validation and then out of those thir ideas maybe 10 ideas go to the next stage uh after being validated by people like they join the weight list and then those 10 people you explain them the value and eventually ask them to pay 70% discount like a prepayment or something like that and then let's say three ideas survive so you have you know three out of 100 uh and then you have these three ideas you can sell basically now with the little audience with the prepayments with the ID itself with with the landing page let's say you say you sell it for 3,000 or $2,000 and that's like $6,000 and to do all this if there is a system for that and you built little tool for that to do all this you would spend maybe $1,000 right or or $2,000 so the margins are pretty good and the margins get better and better as more ideas and things you do in the system and everything can be automated like literally everything you can buy domains VI apis you can you know make ads the same way landing pages can be generated using some builders that have apis as well so this can be turned into into a tool and then basically just turn this tool on and it keeps doing the job and even the ideas it can find the ideas uh based on the same algorithm you did by hands but now you can automate that as well using Ai and using scraping and now the system can do 1,000 ideas a month right and then you have 30 winning ideas and you sell them yeah it's so this is a really smart idea because no one's doing it you know yeah no one is doing it and there you know of course there's marketplaces for startups like aire.com and flipa but also there's no Marketplace for what you're describing which is basically what you're describing is is let us do all the work for validating a startup idea let us let us get you your first 100,000 customers and then once uh the uncertainty is taken away a lot of the uncertainty we are going to hand that for hand that over to you but you are going to pay us a premium for for that and it's kind of it's a win-win situation because uh the person who's inheriting that uh that new product is they didn't have to go through all that hassle of going through the ideas finding those customers as you said you know Finding customers isn't easy and now all of a sudden they can buy something for cheap because if they would have went on one of you know one of the startup marketplaces or buy a startup you know that's EST that's going to be already too expensive so this is like a cheaper version of that yeah if you go to the startup Marketplace and they check the prices there so uh you would have no users and no revenue and no validation products for the same price just because they can build something there but it's not the part that's important like uh you can build stuff like building stuff is easy right like it's the easiest part of the startup and if if there are users prepayments and certain validation then it's at least 10K right and that's way too expensive so you glossed over something that I think is really important that I want to unpack a little bit so you said you prefer influencers right now over ads and you're you're seeing rates like $300 for $100,000 views could you walk us through how you think about like how do you acquire these or how do you do these deals with these influencers how do you reach out to them what is your process to do this yeah so there are a lot of influencers now a lot more than there were a year ago I think uh AI has helped and the new Twitter algorithm has H so uh there are a lot of people doing that for living and uh I kind of I was looking at that segment uh two years ago as well and I was checking the prices and it was at least 1K and they would guarantee maybe 30,000 views uh and then I kept asking the same people price again every few months uh and now it's way lower just because there are more people kind of doing the same thing there's competition and they dropped the prices so now it's uh it's $300 some is $100 so I have uh some deals for $100 just because I buy often so if somebody sells for $300 and you buy five times they they drop the price right and in my case I have a lot of products and I buy very often I just reach out on uh Twitter and Linkedin just direct messages sometimes they reach out to me it's more often that they reach out to me then I reach out to them uh they offer their service so it's pretty simple to find but usually they start with really high price so you would get like you know 700 or 800 at the start uh and you should just bargain that down to few hundred and and that usually works even if they say no so that's how it works for me they say no but then they come back four weeks after because they have this one week slot that's not taken and 200 is better than nothing so they say you can take it right and if you have enough of influencers uh in your pipeline in your list then uh there's always a wick open for one of them or a few of them and you buy and then eventually when you bought five or 10 times you agree on fixed price that's pretty low and what I do now I'm doing new things so I'm experimenting and it's pretty interesting so I pay influencers fixed amount every month and it is similar to partnership like like the football stars to with with Nike Etc but on a micro on Nano scale right so and I pay them fixed money every month and they know it will be coming in uh whatever happens and I commit for 12 months consolation so I I I won't conso uh unless I give the notice so a lot of people like it and I have certain amount of stuff I can do on their account like it can be a post it can be part of the listicle it can be a reply Etc and now uh the price goes very low for me there's some risk so they might just you know lose their engagement and reach and then I still pay them but uh it never really happens like I haven't seen influencer like completely going out of the business like some some changes in the algorithm and they get back so and I actually plan to launch a tool around that basically to make that kind of the whole not a Marketplace but a little like people say on Twitter I'm Reinventing the AdSense but yeah AdSense for micro startups cool yeah I like that I think also like it sounds like you're doing a very manual process in terms of responding to influencers reaching out to influencers there's probably a lot of ways that you can automate a lot of it and especially with AI you know you can just feed a list of here's my Niche and here's like the 100 influencers and like hit them up every week with or every two weeks C you know with an email saying hey like you know are you willing to you know your price is X will willing to pay you half X yeah here's one more idea there's one more idea I needan every idea vers another idea is is the issue is is my constant issues I'm constantly having when I come up with an idea I'm like oh that's a good idea or that's a bad idea but you know oh what if we Chang this and oh that could do this you know so there's that's the idea maze that's why they call it the Maze and yeah I'm definitely always in it but yeah I love that I think a lot of people go towards ads as a they're just it's just the the easiest way you know it's so simple to set up an ad campaign but I I do think that the micro influencers particularly when you're like reaching out to them is there's a lot of alpha there um not sure how long that Alpha is going to last that Arbitrage is going to last because as more and more marketplaces come up the the prices I'd imagine end up becoming it you know more visible it's kind of like how real estate was so in real you know today in real estate you know you have the MLS so you have basically a database of all the different at least in North America um I don't know how it works in Turkey but um in North America you have this system and it's basically you can set up like alerts and you can see everything that's in the system but back in the day when things weren't online you know you might have seen a building for sale and they listed it at 200,000 and it was really worth 600,000 but because they didn't have access to the data it was wildly underpriced it was a misprice asset and I think you're starting to see the same thing with that kind of concept like we're in that era with influencers right now not everything is available actually we're in that area specifically with micro influencers in in in influencers mega influencers I feel like there's very little mispriced attention but when it comes to smaller creators and smaller accounts there is a ton of opport Unity to uh get something that's worth $1,000 for $200 yeah I mean I was just having this dilemma today like I'm using social media a lot and I'm getting I'm getting good at it and my my reach is growing but at the same time uh it's hurting my my other part like I can't build as much as I as I built know years ago and I see that happening with a lot of the other people like I I posted that on Twitter and I had a lot of DMS from people saying like you know I have the same thing and I think we G to have very huge epidemic of uh people you know turning full-time influencers because it's actually really hard to keep building and influencing or you creating content at the same time and if that's happening then the number of people who are uh on the market you know will be growing and it will be a lot of people there so I actually think that even when we put this into a Marketplace like with real estate in the case of real estate the number of houses isn't growing much is growing very slow but here I think it's nearly exponential growth of influencers so I think it will be more similar to Spotify where actually the cost of Music dropped almost to zero you can listen and everything for like you know fixed price I think it'll be similar thing here right but again since we're competing and if I have an access to influencers and you have access to influencer and we both advertise our products then you know uh we'll have the same access but at least at the beginning like people who utilize influencers they will gain a lot of momentum compared to those who don't yeah yeah I think that's right I think the supply of you know creators and influencers is going up and up and especially with you know faceless YouTube channels uh and faceless accounts in general meme Pages if if the ability to create content becomes a lot easier than more content exist meaning more competition for eyeballs um which means that the Monopoly that creators have become smaller and smaller that's why I think right now is such a beautiful time to be creating yeah products and and I don't know like I said you know I don't know how long this lasts but it's beautiful because as you said it number one it's cheaper now than it's cheaper than ever to create it's uh there's misprice influencer and Creator opportunities and there's number three there's the ability to use AI to enhance support and systematize and automate a lot of content so you have these three things and it's it's just a it's a beautiful it's a beautiful time to be building I want to uh I want to segue to your and and talk about ideas around directories because when I think of directories to me you're like the directory King and I just want you to talk about like why why are you building directories and and do you have any specific ideas that you can give away around directories I had passion for directories for many years I would say and uh two years ago I had a team and we were discussing directories and I wanted to go full into that stuff and and my team said like look this is uh in obsolete stuff like nobody does directors it was cool in 2017 but not anymore H and I was like no I don't think so but I wasn't sure to actually you know follow my own idea so I I didn't start and then I start later like just just last year uh I I think directories are under appre underappreciated why because when the quantity grows the quality the percentage wise drops so the more things you can choose from the harder are is to choose and it means that people really want to go to places where where the selection has been done for them either selection or categorization or other type of uh enrichment of information so that they can pick the right tool or anything the right item right and the amount of like the quantity on all the scales is growing like the there are like hundreds of CRM tools there are hundreds of any kind of tools and tomorrow it'll be thousands and then it will be 10 thousand like it will just keep growing right like like the old ones aren't being deleted they they stay too and the new ones are adding up on top and that's same with regular stuff as well like there there more coffee shops there are more people selling stuff around so everything is growing and it's harder and harder to choose and I think uh the directories are here to solve that problem so people trust other people who have reason to trust them and I think think the directories made by people who show that they have certain experience in this field and you can trust their choice you can trust their judgment on this list uh people will even pay for that and we see that like they like I'm not charging for my directories like people can use them but I see a lot of people now starting to charge for good directories and people actually pay to have access to that data all right because they just want to save time on know selecting out of 10,000 items and to have just 100 the best being sent to them every week like you know even things like uh for example there is this guy uh Pat his name is Pat and he does starter story you probably know him and I think you had podcast with him and like even that is directory in my head because it's a directory of stories about startups and people pay him because he does the job of picking the best Founders and putting their stores in right yes so I think like when I say directory people always have this image of of a list of boring items there like why would it be there like list of house or or list of names but it can be list of anything and people are willing to pay for that and people are willing to be in that list uh so you can both monetize you know the the one side and the other side and I think we are just starting with that I think we are like uh just entering the directory age as they call it uh because uh the AI made it even easier to create everything the information products and everything and obviously the quality dropped a bit so now people are even more interested and the other thing that I'm thinking about uh that most don't think about is that uh AI will have to figure out how to find the best items to recommend to people right and uh what are they using now they are using uh Reddit they're using other kind of uh places and For Me Reddit is a directory partly is a directory as well like for AI it looks like a directory it's a place where people with reputation you know uh order things they can vote for them and then there is a list ordered by votes and that's a directory too so I think the directories will eventually be really important for AI and the best directories will be chosen by AI to be used for the search results and and and if that happens to your directory that means that uh you have huge power and uh people are willing to pay to be there as well right yeah so so so you know people are bought in I mean I don't know how you listen to that and and aren't bought in I think like the idea around people there's so much uncertainty and so much content that people just want a trusted Source make sense to I think a lot of people and you know we talk about directories like oh yeah it's been around for the last few years and it's but like the reality is D you know since the internet existed directories have been a thing you know organizing information the first day it's not the first day and you have like you have publicly traded you know companies uh Angie which was formerly called Angie's List I mean does you know billion billion three in Revenue you know so big businesses that basically are just databases of curated trusted people and people are willing to pay for it so that's what I that's what I like about directories too I mean it's proven it's trusted and you said the the magic words which is you know it started to get uncool and some started to get un cool what does that mean if you're listening to this it means if it's uncool there's Arbitrage there's opportunity to come in and find something that's mispriced and and do something so yes now we're bought in what directory ideas do you have for for us there are two types of directory ideas I have in mind and I have in my pipeline so one is local directories so basically there are a lot of directories in English I would say m of them are in English and uh there are very few on local languages so like it's really hard to find directory of uh you know S tools made by French people in France right for example so I think moving forward the quantity will be so large that directories will have to find more filters because like now people don't want to go to a place where they have everything they rather want to go to place that has fewer items than too many so I so one way to do this is find the directory that's working really well in us uh and just find a country where there is no directory like that and it's easy to find you Just Google like the best thing about directories is that the whole research is in Google you just search for something and if you don't see good result on the top you go for it right and uh so that's how you test it you find good directories in bigger countries and you search in the other language like let's say in French uh and if it doesn't exist on top of the Google results uh you build it right and and then of course you have to solve the the the reputation problem Etc uh but usually uh it is uh solvable over time like if you work on directory you start learning the topic you start learning the tools you start to making podcasts with founders of all these tools for example like there are a lot of easy ways to actually you know uh gain reputation within segment so is the idea there I'm going to go find validated English directories and then I'm just going to apply what you know my let's say French I'm going to apply my language French to it and then and then localize it to for example France France and Canada and senagal and French speaking countries is that the idea yeah yeah yeah exactly because there are a lot of people uh who don't speak English in those countries actually most people don't and people say like don't those who don't speak English they are not in Tech it's not true you knowt a lot of people speak only French or prefer French and they build within there and they have large Market too and eventually at some point they go International when things go bigger right yeah I mean you're talking to a guy I mean I'm literally sitting in a place where 94% of the people here where I'm where I'm sitting speak French as their first language so you know you know there are there are you know the American POV is always like focus on America it's such a big market and and it's true in a lot of ways like it is such a big market and it and it's it's a it's an amazing Market but that doesn't mean that they're with with what's happening around the E the the East to create directories and and creating new tools and like we talked about audiences and stuff like that why not just take something that's working and apply it to a a local market I think makes a lot of sense and again this is not something that we're in Reinventing do you remember rocket internet yeah yeah exactly rocket yeah right those those guys in Germany that basically would look at popular Silicon Valley startups that raised a ton of money and be like okay great eBay is popping off in the US let's go create the eBay for uh you know North Africa yeah and they it it was a brilliant idea I think they're down fall a little bit was that they went public and but like the idea of like rocket internet not you know cash flowing makes a lot of sense I think like that's a huge idea so this is a really John I hope you know you're you're given a really good idea over here I mean the the best part about the re is that that most people don't appreciate is that uh it's very little teag so it's it's it's easy the building part is really easy like in the rocket internet they had to put a lot of money into that and here it's like if there's one thing you could do where you don't need money but you need your own time that's a directory right uh because it needs time to make the quality of the content good and promote it but it doesn't need time for building it which is like it just needs a little bit of time comparing to SS absolutely so you so you were saying before I got really exced exed about that idea that you had a second idea around directories what was that yeah the so the second idea about directories is that it's not particular directory it's just the method that I apply myself very often uh and it just works I mean it works so well that I feel it can't be true that it just works almost every time uh is but when you search for keyword on Google ad plan it's a free tool like it's ads. Keyword Planner something like that and you search for keywords around random topics and then you find a keyword that has high traffic and then you search for that keyword on Google and only block posts are shown on the top that's the idea like you just build a directory around that and Google really likes directories and eventually you will get to the top two so it is it's kind of soulless so you don't pick the idea that you like but you can actually pick the ideas you like and test them for traffic but overall when I do that I don't use any of my own judgment because then I tend to pick the idea that's not so good it has a little traffic but I think it's good and my my intuition never works and that's the thing like I think with director ideas intuition always fail fails because when you test it turns out the opposite so in in my directories all directories I had high hopes for they failed and those I didn't have hopes for succeeded and I think the reason is that if I have high hopes a lot of people also have high hopes for the same directory because it's kind of I'm I'm an average of the society and whatever I think most likely a lot of other people think right so we can all build the same thing so this is the idea just use technical method like find keyword with high traffic search for it if it doesn't have any directory on the first page of Google go and build it and you can do that for 10 ideas like it's cheap it's fast you do for 10 IDs and then you drop seven and you push harder on three how do you come up with the keywords like how do you know what are the keywords that are highly trafficked yeah so it is uh it's boring I asked CH B so what would be an example prompt that you know that you would use with chat GPT uh I I give you the real one uh so I want to have directory so usually I launch directories to help my other SAS tools to bring traffic so and then I had this uh couple of Dev tools like you have Dev hunt and and flat UI and and I want to drive traffic there so I I want to build a directory uh for developers so I just asked J I said I have this this and this and I want this audience give me 20 ideas and gave me 20 ideas and then uh I just tested all 20 and one was great right so it's a it feels like like a steel like you know it feels a bit boring like sometimes too easy and but it works it works I I think a lot of the times uh Founders think that it's uh uh things have to be hard I think things don't have to be hard but you have to do the right things but doing the right things is hard right so that's kind of the thing well I think what it is is great entrepreneurs bet heavily when the odds are stacked in their favor so what you're doing the process that you're mentioning is is pretty methodical like there's a lot of steps associated with it so it's less creative in that sense it's less I'm taking a blank canvas and I'm drawing something beautiful and putting it out into the world uh and it's more more like a science experiment but what it does is when you use things like Google Keyword Planner is it reduces your risk and allows you to build something when the odds are stacked in your face you know that with a certain percent of probability that this is going to hit some level of success and of course it's going to be a numbers game so just like you know betting it's just you have to I I don't think and and correct me if I'm wrong I don't think that you're going to hit J chbt with a high Search terms uh directory stuff and then you pick the first one and it happens to you know work I think this is something that you have to apply a portfolio approach try try multiple of them but I think the key is you're reducing risk uh along the way um John we're going to end it here because there's just two there there's too much there's too much good in this um I want people to check out John at his ex account he just posts every single day what he's learning in real time building his 20 businesses is it's John Rush X and he's also got a A list of all his many projects John rush. me uh check it out and it's inspiring because I think the the model that you're applying is is really the future of building startup so thank you for sharing it with us yeah thanks for having me here of course later thanks everyone [Music] B

so how would I do this how would I actually go and create something like this if I wanted to go build a startup step one you use AI to create content step two is that just creates this SEO juice and step three is you monetize initially by affiliate and that's the Playbook that's the idea I hope someone takes it it's it's a no-brainer oh and by the way I think that this is easily $100,000 a month business [Music] hello everybody it's me Greg Eisenberg I'm doing a solo podcast today from my home in the mountains of Canada and I've got a lot of ideas today but there's one in particular I want to share and I hope someone takes this idea and then towards the end of the episode I will share four or five ideas that people have sent to me and hopefully it'll get your creative juices flowing so let's get right into it I came across an article about microplastics recently I didn't know this but teabags have billions of microplastics uh in them so it's not just water bottles and stuff like that and uh this whole micr Plastics thing is everyone's talking about it and apparently they found that some like huge percentage of men have microplastics in their testicles so it's uh it went viral after that in this article I saw a link to one of the scientific journals nature or science or just or one of them and I started reading one of the scientific papers and it was just so dense I mean it's written for scientists so hence my idea that was the Insight the Insight is there's tons of cool things going on in scientific papers but they are written for scientists what if we can extract probably using AI insights from scientific papers uh curate it and write it in plain English for people to read I think that a lot of people would be down with that uh so I'm going to be share I'll share my screen should give you a sense of how I think about these things um and how I come up with you know some of these ideas so I had that I had that insight and then I went to perplexity perplexity doai uh the AI search engine and I was just like what are the best places to find scientific journals and research papers turns out there's Google Scholar which indexes 200 million scholarly articles across disciplines there's bass which indexes 136 million academic documents there's core which is 136 million and then there's semantic scholar uh which has 40 million articles so first of all I read that and I was like whoa I didn't realize that there were that many academic AR Les you know think about how many insights are are in these I mean of course some are less relevant to the average person than others um but I bet you there's tons of insights there uh so I see there's also some repositories there's also libraries so I see this and then I actually I want to go check out the nature website and I look at it and this is uh music to my ears when I see a website that looks like this it sort of looks like it's been built in the late 2000s um there's nothing better than this in fact I can't even click here um it's not even letting me click because this popup is up it's just it's pretty brutal um so I really like that and you it just you know to me this is validation that uh you know you have you have uh a lot of people who are referencing these articles you have million hundreds of millions of Articles and that there's just an opportunity to uh create a repository of you know made for you know non scientists so how would I do this how would I actually go and create something like this um if I wanted to go build a startup so first I would come up with you know me I like a catchy name so I think about what is a catchy name um that kind of play that kind of makes fun of the idea that uh scientific journals are for brainiacs and I sort of think about that I use that as my prompt and I just write a bunch of names related to that and then I would actually probably use chat GPT open Ai and some other AI uh products to start uh fine-tuning way to uh unpack scientific articles with one or two key insights so I would probably spend you know a few thousand dollars trying to figure that out because I would use that and essentially create a Twitter account that would automatically post these things and I'd probably do like a before and after as well right like I'd show like here's the 25,000 uh word scientific journal article and here's the 25w Insight you know here's what you could you should actually care about um and I'm sure you're thinking well how can I make money from something like this okay great you eventually build this and it gets more popular um well you know you could do affiliate products right so you know using the example of the teabag thing um the the teabag is interesting because uh there are companies uh like I buy TF a company called Firebelly t.com which is just loose leaf tea and the loose leaf tea doesn't have the microplastics so I can just strike up an affiliate deal and maybe they already have an affiliate partnership and I can just say like switch to Firebelly so you generate and this is this is a a bigger Trend I'm starting to see more of where well use AI to Step One you use AI to create content step two is that just creates this SEO juice and so the SEO starts bringing people uh you know every single month every single day so you know it's you have customers basically coming on autopilot now this takes six 8 nine 12 months to actually build but you know it it does take time SEO takes times and step three is you monetize initially by affiliate and that's the Playbook that's the idea I hope someone takes it um it's it's a no-brainer oh and by the way I think that this is easily $100,000 a month business at you know once it starts the SEO starts to kick in hey everyone if you're anything like me you've got a ton of design work that you need websites landing pages emails social assets you name it but you don't just want beautiful landing pages are beautiful websites you want the stuff that's going to convert you want the stuff that's going to actually drive out that's where design scientist.com comes in it's an agency that for one monthly price will do all your design work all your copy work all your engineering and do stuff that actually scales your Revenue you don't need a designer you need a design scientist let's go design scientist.com I liked it so much I invested in the business so let's talk about I did a live stream where I just took kind of people's question you know uh where I took people's ideas for startups and we just jammed on it and I gave them feedback and I want to give uh a few people so just talk talk about their ideas and tell you how what I think about them now these are just ideas from people like you listening um so some are good some are bad and I'll tell you why they're good why they're bad and what what I think of them uh uh Matthew mcore sandies on Instagram says this idea is like the rewarding exercise idea but for gaming uh I think he's talking about um The Sweat coin so you you basically for the amount of uh steps that you do they would give you a coin and pay you basically so he says here's the idea you link your gaming account Steam account for the MVP and you earn tokens for your hours played and then you could spend those tokens on affiliate products offers could partner with gaming Brands and even streamers to enable their viewers to get exclusive access to products via the platform now I love the idea of hooking into your steam data which has like literally hundreds of millions of users because I don't think a lot of people are hooking into that data and based on it giving you a rewards now we all know about uh credit card rewards um there's a company uh called drop a friend of mine started it join drop.com I think he raised like 50 or 75 million uh he basically created an app called drop and you link your debit and credit card to it and then you get these points like additional points and then you can spend those points at Amazon or Walmart our Old Navy he Str he did deals with all these different e-commerce websites and yeah I don't know if they like sell the points like sorry I don't know if they sell the data or how how that works um but 5 million people have downloaded the app so it's it's the real deal so yes I think like a drop but for steam is a huge huge idea but I'm not sure I would build it on top of web 3 rails to start because I don't think it really needs to be so uh I would say someone should build something that rewards Gamers for you know what's their kill death ratio how many hours have they played um are they having a streak have they logged in every single day um and I think the thing to check here is is it steam is it Activision is this data available but I do think that there's a huge business to be built on loyalty plus gaming so that's a good one all right this guy messaged me his Instagram is carne shabo that's the name of his business I'm working on a grass-fed wagu beef fried meat snack we're targeting mostly women so think of it like carnivore snacks for women so then I go to his Instagram well first of all I go to I go to the Instagram I I just assume it was a woman uh who who was messaging me and then I it's like not at all he says he's targeting women and it's this you know white guy with a hat and like a big beard like eating meat it's like the complete opposite yes he is wearing a pink hat in one of them but you know this dude is a is a male so I like the idea of taking something that you know women do and bring it to men women wear makeup men's makeup is a you know a trend that's uh only getting bigger you can just go through the list of things that are popular for women and see if that makes sense for men and vice versa vice versa what's something that's become popular for men or is popular for men and what can you bring to women now if you're going to do that you got to make sure that it's authentic because I think any anyone who's going to go to this Instagram if you're a woman you're going to be like this is just this this just you know just because you're wearing a pink hat doesn't mean it's connecting with me so I like the idea of this I just think that if I was him I would work with a Creator and I wouldn't be seen at all in front of the camera I I just I don't think that he's the right Creator it just doesn't have Creator product Market fit and that's something for you to think about is you know when you're building your business because you know every business now is a Creator business are you the right creator for it or should someone else be and being honest with that is really important now I want you to think about what are some typically uh male products or typically female products and can you bring it to the to the other gender because I think that framework for thinking about startup ideas is a winning one and I think uh what I often do is you know if I come up with an idea let's say makeup for men I mean that's quite an obvious one but you know something like that then I go to Google Trends and then I'll go to see okay where where has makeup for men you know where has that gone you know in terms of Trends over the last 12 18 five years um 12 18 months five years so it's a it's a good it's good to come up with the thesis and then double check it with the data um and the other sort of bonus idea to this is what you could do is you can find something that starts to be trending for women let's say and and then bring it to men right so you don't have to you you know something that's very new and then bring it to men and again it doesn't need to be positioned exactly this is for men or this is for women but just from a Creator standpoint a branding perspective a positioning perspective a messaging perspective like you know another idea would be like a a candle company for men candles are getting more and more popular is there an opportunity to create like the de facto uh men's Candle Company all right let's go to the next idea we're on a roll here Yash BW says Ultra Niche idea there's a website called what pl. info which tells you the plugs and adapters you need when you are traveling to a new city but their UI was made like 10 years back so this is one of those ideas that I want to be a part like I wish that this existed on the internet but I don't want to be the person to build it now if you have you know if you if you're not worried about money and you're not worried about growing your business and you just want to put this out in the internet and you want it to be a utility of the internet not a business of the internet a utility of the internet then go ahead and create this and sometimes I do that and I love doing that sometimes um but you have to realize that this is not a business it's not a business because the there's no business model here you know okay if you get 25,000 people a month to come and or 100,000 you know best case to come and check out this website with uh the plugs and adapters you need when you're traveling to new city which you by the way probably know most of the time anyways like what's next you're going to put Google ads AdSense there like I'm not going to go buy an iPhone from you so we can't do the affiliate thing um so this is just one of those ideas that like I wish exists but um just you know and just because the UI is 10 years old doesn't mean it's necessarily a good business when we talked about the scientific journal one I think that was more interesting to me from an affiliate standpoint because you can actually cherry-pick scientific journals take out the insights that are relevant to products and then sell those products um where is this I just don't really see that happening and it feels very Niche so sometimes lesson learn sometimes Ultra Niche is too Niche I always say you want to go Niche and then think about can you go a little bit nicher I call that super Niche but when you're talking about Ultra Niche you know this is sometimes that's not a business idea that's a utility uh but thank you thank you for this uh Yash um William Blaze says new idea here newsletter and job board for companies that qualify for qsbs and allow 83b early election for people looking to join early stage companies with tax advantage outcomes so for those outside the US who don't know what qsbs and 83b is uh qsbs is just a tax law that allows uh Founders and early employees to save money on stock basically and 83b is the same sort of idea it's a tax way for early employees Founders to save money on on stock again this feels a little too Niche also job board Plus you know qsbs feels like the reason why you're going to join a startup it's like you believe in the founders you believe in the mission you think you can add value it's not because you can do an 83b election so sometimes you come up with an idea and you're like oh I wish I could you know this what probably happen here is William Blaze here that is his real name William Blaze was like oh you know I had an issue with you know I started a company and I never signed my 83b and I it was a mistake and something happened you know like I had a bad experience so other people might have that experience but again this is a bit too Ultra Niche and I'm not con I'm not convinced that job Seekers think about this when they're when they're actually going and looking for their jobs um okay another startup idea Alejandro oranz says feedback on this idea and we just built it it's called sweetro fantasy league for real life physical activities so it says virtual race platform and fantasy league for real life physical activities competition is not about winning or losing it's about pushing ourselves to be the best we can be okay how does it work you basically sync your device it creates like a sweetro profile so like it's a fitness tracker and then you join a challenge you commit to a goal and then you earn cash rewards by completing the challenge so this is actually very similar to what we talked about for the gaming one you're just getting rewarding getting rewarded for getting fit and then they've got you know four brands that are compatible Garmin sunto Wahoo polar um and like one of the it sounds like the reason why oh interesting so a lot of them you actually have to pay wow okay so this is wow wild so I'm looking at one of the challenges run 45k in one week the entry fee is $5 but the pot is $30 or you can uh the July 4th 10k run the entry fee is $10 and I'm not sure how big the pot is um since say but there's some pot the tour to France challenge uh it's a free entry fee and pot is $300 so this kind of feels like somewhat gambling I mean it's kind of gambling right you're putting in money and there's a pot um interesting um I just think that there's a lot of friction with getting people to put money in I mean if they're going to do this maybe they you know they rather put money in a meme coin like if they're trying to gamble there's other ways that they're going to go and gamble so I'm not sure that I love that approach um I think this could be like a small business um which is cool and I think the impact of it is really cool like you're making people more healthy um but I think that this is something that a big company uh might do Ian not the gambling piece but just motivating people to to be more active um I think that if I'm a startup and I'm trying to like deal with the Garmin a apis and the cinto apis and the Wahoo apis and the polar apis I mean I've only only heard of Garmin I just feel like that's a lot of work to do upkeep of the app deal with like people's money and entry fees I don't love it I like simple businesses that's why I like the gaming one it was like okay you're going to plug into one API and it's Gamers and you're not going to ask anything from them they're just going to get rewarded so it's just a win-win proposition so uh this is cool but I personally wouldn't start something like this and there you have it bunch of ideas for you create get your creative juices flowing uh if you like this please please follow uh subscribe on your platform of choice and go to YouTube uh to to write a comment I read every single one of them and uh I enjoy reading them I'm having a blast reading them and it helps me know if you like this it helps me know what I should talk more about and I'm trying to make this the best possible show for you to make it the most valuable show for you and I want you to have a good time and I want you to learn along the way and I want you to come up with ideas along the way and uh you're going to take one of these ideas sometime and you're going to you're going to build something big so uh it's been real I'll see you later and uh thanks for tuning in later [Music]

oneperson video agency all the spoke work done stuff for like Volvo Autodesk some you know qun some big brands in the UK and us um but I'm looking to like productize differentiate streamline my video agencies it's not really as much a startup idea it's getting your take on how I could streamline and differentiate my video company and maybe create a similar thing that like you've got uh with some of your agencies the problem I've got is like video is it's like it's high-end video so it's in person right you know that's the challenge it's like how do I scale this up because the area I live in in the northwest of the UK it's not there's not much happening here so it's it's challenging what's uh uh I'm going to go to your website what is the name of your website it's a GD so my initials got gdv video.co uh and at the moment it's literally just a Squarespace portfolio of some of the work all right I'm gonna put you on blast it's okay if I share your website yeah cool cool so here to tell your story creators of authentic branded content Micco documentaries and Commercial films first of all these are like three different things so I think what what what you're going to have to do is figure out what is your angle and what are you going to productize and then what the price Point's going to be um it's interesting because what you're talking about you know you say it almost as a negative is like you do in person and like you know I think what you see in a lot of productized video agencies is they don't do in person and so I actually see this as like your your skill set of like bringing Crews and like doing literal like Volvo commercial which by the way is my dream I I drive a Volvo um like this is this is what people want coming up right um so the question to you is where you know these are all kind of different actually you have a lot of like health and wellness you have some Auto here what let's start with who do you who do you think you have an unfair Advantage with in terms of customer base um so I've don't know lower down on the page I've done a lot of outdoor sport documentaries like original documentaries um the problem is there's not a lot of those Brands don't have a lot of money for marketing or they're using a lot of user generated content um my best client on there who was the de leopard thing I did is a company called Neeve who are like the Rolls-Royce of uh audio recording equipment uh and I also did a music production degree so there's something around maybe like music technology uh brands uh but they're randomly based where I live uh they're am- ne.com they they're my best client I've got them on retainer I do all their social content um and I'd like to sort of get another 10 of those clients I guess um so I guess you could call them like a premium brand uh technology type brand um the the thing is I'm just surrounded here by like boring businesses which might not be a bad thing but uh I don't it doesn't lend itself to my skill set which is like higher endend production [Music] um I don't know I guess to be honest I'm just a bit a bit tired of going out and doing everything myself as well it's like I I work with Freelancers so I don't hire anyone I've got a freelance team so I can send crews out but then it's never quite as good as if I do it myself so it's like how do I you know is is it more a case of I keep the bespoke video agency and try and you know teach other videographers how to grow a onep person business or um I don't know do I help Brands more with like strategies as a product size service then offer bespoke production on the back end well I'll tell you where I see the opportunity and okay where I see the opportunity is I don't see anyone owning documentaries for companies like use the word micro documentaries I'm not sure if it's micro documentary on but it's doc you know micro documentaries or documentaries if you can become the micro documentaries guy and you help companies create documentaries every brand needs that because um we're all trying to stand out and video is how we're going to stand out and when I hear the word documentary like what is it it's basically just documenting a story is that right I would say so yeah like done a lot of like branding content like that more like you know storytelling where like I did one for a big uh like music um they're like a ticketing platform in the local area um so we did a series of docs on like upcoming bouns uh with big followings you know to help that so it's like that branded Association content and storytelling but I would say there's a lot of people trying to do that um who's doing it who's the number one person doing that oh I just think every like cool Studio is doing that like if you look at stepped uh step in in the US and farm league we're g we're gonna pull them up because I think it's helpful for people just to understand stepped like St P what was it St PT um maybe uh not sure um Step Studios they're not that they're not that big if they don't own step.com all right here we go cool lot of commercial work as well this feels like commercials yeah there'll probably be a section on like content um but that's the thing is like no one I haven't gone to a landing page it says like we do documentaries for like we do micro documentaries like own something smaller a different phrase a different phrase like own the smaller phrase I talked about this yesterday with you know with boring marketing.com you know a lot of people did SEO but no one owned boring marketing yeah so I think you have to figure out what that is for you micro documentary seems to be really interesting to me if you can put people on a product IED service where it's like for $5,000 a month I'm gonna give you one documentary um micro documentary um that's interesting that's and so who do you you think like sort of more people who do more like brand it's more like a brand play would you say or is it like going behind the scenes of their of their brand or yeah I mean it doesn't it's it's going behind the scenes in Brands it's telling the story I mean sometimes it could be like you know let's say us like a you know we have a remote company um you know we definitely have like uh people in certain areas but let's say we hired you um you know some of the work could actually be like 50% could just be like zooms that we're doing with other people or um and then 50% could be in person um and just you just stitch together and you craft the story and you crack the narrative Arc and then we can use that to put on social and just be like this is you know for example with LCA our Innovation agency it's like this is how uh like it's a micro documentary and how we create a brand for another company so like a case study but it's got the hook of like micro documentary which is yeah more intriguing exactly so I want to hear in the chat is this a sip or a spit on this idea of micro documentaries producti service gu is in this Crossroads we've always been you know we've been in and a lot of us listening have been on the in these Crossroads where we don't know if we should like what we should do next you know he's built a good business but he doesn't know what exactly he should do next of course by the way G while people are sipping and spitting let's you know I think uh of course you could go and teach people how to create you know create a membership paid membership charge for it and teach people but I think that if I'm you I still need to I'm not done yet you know like you've you've built up so many great case studies that you can probably use that to charge a lot for yeah so I I don't know if I'm there yet so okay what are we see what are we seeing we're getting actually a lot of sip so uh ver sip Ryan as a director sip baby so that's you know Justin Nukem sip because people need video John S I think many companies would like the documentary part for example how we started that's true Arvin sip Jason sip uh Ethan SI Victor sip so you're getting a lot of sips there's something there we'll leave you with that get back to your family hopefully they're still there and uh micro that's actually a good line micro doumentary is the new case study I love that this is going to be saved isn't it on YouTube I need to uh exact I watched yesterday is it's so cool what you're doing man you know you could be charging thousands for this it's just so so sick so I'm big fan of the podcast and yeah big fun thank you pleasure my pleasure this is fun all right thanks for joining us thanks all right that was cool G from the UK literally escaped his family poor family but you know he's going back his his his little glass of wine is there up next we've got Joey I'll bring you on stage and then we got Patrick and Victor I see you but you you know it's gonna take a few minutes to get to you all boom and without further Ado Joey welcome to the stage no we can't hear you no worries we'll give you a second all right Joey we oh no Joey hello say something can you hear me now yeah we can hear you now okay cool cool uh Greg I I saw the the episode that you did with starter story uh and I and I think I kind of came across your content a couple times previously but it wasn't until I saw it on starter story and then I started to check out your YouTube channel oh cool well welcome to the Channel I'm doing these I don't know how long I'm going to do them for these live streams but I'm just having fun right now and and it and it seems like others are having fun so yeah it's a cool idea it's a cool idea um I'll tell you a little bit about what I'm working on um and I wanted to get your thoughts specifically as someone who has a holding company um I wanted to get your thoughts on this so right now currently I'm working on a rule up of restoration Contracting companies so restoration contract s these guys are the people that that show up to your home to fix hold on Joey I got to take off my sweater like you're talking about you know rollups you're getting me hot hot and heavy here okay so shirt is off where where where are you based right now right now I am in the middle of I'm looking over at like 90 Acres of P Wilderness in the mountains I'm I'm in I'm in Canada okay and it's just my little nature place where I can go hang out and yeah sure yeah cool um so right now I'm working on a uh a rollup of restoration Contracting businesses so restoration contractors they are essentially the folks that would show up to your home to fix up anything that breaks after a fire water damage it can be as small as like a a burst pipe in your home right and and people really need to fix that as soon as possible before mold sets into their hes so yes it's a very it's it's the pain is very real and people need to um call them as soon as possible and and the amazing thing is the homeowners don't really pay out of pocket because it's usually covered by their insurance so it it's a it's a fairly um uh need to have business so I I really like it and and I've gotten a chance to actually um sit on the so I I run a venture fund um and I invested in a company called alware which essentially is a a service Titan specifically for restoration Contracting I've gotten a chance to work with the founder he and I have gone through a lot of battles together and we really like working with each other so over the last three years we've been thinking about this idea um and so we launched our Restoration company or our restoration rollup idea and we we're starting to have conversations uh the the the website that you should check out is called Long View restoration so Longview restoration.com okay and this would be we're we're bringing together essentially about 15 smaller restoration owners and helping them get to the next level um by buying up probably up to like 80% of their business um helping them retain the 20% and the the cool thing about rollups as you probably know is when you have when you are at let's say like 250 in ibida you're probably trading at like 3x you know 3x if you're lucky but um if you actually get to let's say 10 million or 15 million like you can be trading at 8 to 10x EB D multiple right so theide idea right now is to bring together small restoration guys that frankly you know right now they're just guys who are just working on their businesses heads down they don't necessarily have a retirement plan all the private Equity folks are telling them hey you're too small you're too early for us to even you know entertain um so to bring these guys together buy 80% of their business upfront and then help them retain the 20% give them you know Financial Security up front and then in about five years or six years or so we all exit together and the and that second you know the 20% that they would have retained previously they would be able to sell at the same probably amount as the first 80% right so that's the current idea right now uh there's a lot more detail but I'll just kind of stop here and see if you have any initial questions and who's funding this so this is the thing that I I've been um going back and forth on so there's two options uh the first option is um classic just raise a fund um I think we were going to need about $25 million in terms of equity um and it would you know I probably can scrape together five to 10 million of that through my network because you know I run a venture fund as well um the so so that's that's option one the option two is to do the MVP of this on my own DME and um you know there are SBA Loans involved so the idea would be hey can we find two or three of these you know if we plan on doing 15 can we find two or three of these and Alex and I would just put together our own personal capital and then use SBA loan to lever up uh and a combination of sellers note to make it make it happen and then roll that into the fund if we can prove out the MVP of this right so I me what do you think I I don't know if so what do you think of Splash before I tell you what I think Splash what know Splash okay so I'm gonna share my screen again yeah so similar model uh roll up for pool service companies um yeah I came across them because this guy Jeremy uh Yamaguchi yes like he was the guy from lawn love which was a YC company that was uh a Lawn Care Marketplace okay that's awesome really awesome and then they built the largest Marketplace in in lawn care yes um and then a bunch of like the Cody sanchezes of the world invested in this business and they end oh cool yeah yeah so to me it feels like there's this movement around like Splash for X um right right yes and the one thing I'm missing from your you know your pitch or what I would be doing differently is like how do you integrate vertical software as a part of the offering yeah so building you know one way to and I'm sure you've already thought about this but you know one way to increase multiples you know not just by rolling up is by adding technology to it um and actually creating technology and then selling that to other um other uh restoration uh or or small restoration contractors right so I think that's what the only thing I'm missing from the pitch this is a big idea [Music] um and I think if I were you I probably would do like the first maybe second on my own yeah just just so you could maybe really small ones yes just so you could say that hey like I've done this and you avoid the you avoid the pain that you're going to get when you speak to investors and they're gonna be like well why don't you know why don't you do this yeah yeah the the the um the one thing that I've I've I've spoken to folks like Splash who've kind of done it successfully they've already exited on the other side as as fund managers um one thing I do worry about is um like all startups you're going to end up figuring it out as you go right so like the back office integration and especially in in restoration Contracting there is a lot of complex there's a reason why service Titan hasn't gone into this space and it's because of you have to deal with insurance yeah Insurance workflows are an absolute nightmare right so uh I think there's going to be a lot to figure out right so everything from estimation and coding all the different you know line items for insurance companies um all the way to um collecting from the insurance companies and and to be fair alware the software company that is also actually a YC company as well and they've been trying for the last three years they right now they're a project management company and now they're like trying and going through that process of trying to own everything on that platform um and it's a complex problem man it's it's it's painful and I think like when I integrate the first two or three there's going to be a lot of lessons there um which maybe I don't want to learn on someone else's dime maybe I should just learn it on my own dime first before you know bringing you know taking on external investors I mean you could do both right so you can as you know you can you could just ra start like I want to raise $10 million or whatever and and create the deal and raise but in the in the background you're you're buying you're not relying on that closing right and so I think it's it's worthwhile to do it I think the only thing again missing from the pitch is going to be that vertical Tech piece yes and I think that's gonna really excite the right people I mean I'm interested I'm interested you know if you end up raing awesome that's good Market validation yeah I'm interested let me know how it turns out and um yeah maybe there's a way we can partner in some way where we can you know we've built some of the biggest s vertical SAS products through our a genci so maybe there's a way that we can somehow partner I'm not sure but um thank yeah what what are people thinking is this a sip or spit idea is uh should Joey do it himself take out his own dollars or uh or go raise from the Dark Side sip or spit even though he's a part of the dark side right I am I am part of the dark set and I I think I might have seen a McKenzie logo somewhere in I oh no you got to dig up my True Bru got him where you located Joey while while people are sipping and I I recently moved from uh the bay to Nashville oh so sick of California taxes man I just oh nice well uh one of my business partners lives in Nashville so oh really you should definitely uh reach out um you could you can hit him up on Twitter Jordan mix jrdn X mix um he'll be here later during the stream okay you're getting a bunch of sips um just go for it though people are saying Victor is saying just go for it and I think that's right super sip you got a super wow super good idea and I think for folks listening you're sort of seeing you're seeing this uh this macro Trend around Splash for X so think about what is your Fair Advantage is there a way for you to roll up certain businesses buy them for a fair price um and this is the Warren Buffet model right um yeah and uh and sort of bring them together operate at scale increase operational uh efficiencies but the one thing that Warren Buffett wouldn't do is create that vertical software layer which I think really increases the um the value invest in yourself people say sip invest in yourself good good stuff Joey thanks for coming on and thanks Greg sharing with us awesome who and up next we have Mr Patrick feedback freak.com that's right can you hear me yes sir welcome to the stage thanks Greg thanks for having me on yeah I'm big big admirer of you and uh I guess your method of of uh method of Madness yeah method of Madness building the audience first and letting sort of the product fall out of that so I think my my questions are um I guess that's that's like where to focus my energy I have all these ideas for tools to build to support basically writers to basically get feedback and publish better stuff more frequently is sort of the goal um and that's you know through encouragement and and criticism um and some of that's done peer-to-peer some of that's going to be done with a Marketplace this is all very new by the way I launched this like two months ago um coming out of WR a passage I don't know if you know of course yeah okay sweet nice so that yeah course and yeah just coming out of was like okay like you know all the things that exist in that cohort are amazing and when it was ending everyone was just like yeah it'd be awesome to continue doing these like the gyms which are just like when you meet and you you know pitch your idea or you give feedback to people one-on-one uh that's just like peer-to-peer stuff or like the you know professional editors that give you feedback so it's pretty much just surfacing those things that exist in the cohort that then just abruptly end um but then of course I've dreamed up all these other things of like you know potentially like AI tools that can do some helpful you know for like organizing making your writing a little more punchier or clearer uh uh you know inline editing type stuff that's gamified where you know there's no like kind of Free Loaders or Free Riders so that people really want to give editing back to each other um there's a bunch of stuff you could do but you know as a follower view it's like I think probably what I should do first is try to grow an audience and like really kind of interview them and understand all right and I'm a writer so I'm B basing some of the assumptions around what I need but uh you know building the audience first of course would help guide like a more Crystal Clear Vision of what is actually needed um and I'm just like maybe I'm hamstrung around like I'm like God man can I really grow an audience like I only had like 50 people sign up for uh like gyms or whatever and uh just through R A Passage the last cohort just ended so it got a little bit of bump there but i' had some encour you know like oneon-one you know encouragement from people saying like oh was a good idea like I love I like the idea that it's not really crystallized very well but uh at any event yeah curious to just hear your thoughts and like where I should focus my energy I guess so Zach asked a really good question what does someone giving feedback get out of it great question yeah I think for the peer-to-peer stuff I me there's going to be Marketplace I'm launching where they actually get paid so that's a separate sort of offering but for the peer-to-peer stuff I think I guess my pitch them would be giving feedback helps you become a better writer and a better thinker um and it makes you more self-aware as a writer um and I think a lot of people realize that they go through right a passage at least but probably it's not too obvious to everyone um maybe potentially if they're trying to sell like editing Services too or like some Consulting service know that's sort of a lead generation for them but other than that yeah it's not really a ton of value good question and okay so here's how I would do it if I were you so I first of all I think the Insight around you know I'm you know because I'm a writer myself and I I I sometimes most of the time 99% of the time I write in a silo and I'll even have like my wife just be like hey what do you think of this like she reads A lot of my stuff yeah just um but I would also love the ability for a Prof you know professional writer or you know even you know someone who's writing on the internet publishing out there to give me feedback and I'd pay for it uh so I like that Insight but I think you're you're in for a world of pain based on what I've seen um because I think you're going to have issues incentivizing at scale you're going to have issues incentivizing in people to to matchmake basically um and I wonder if there's a you know question I wonder if there's a simpler way to actually do what you're trying to do like what if there was an email that you send your piece and you get a loom five minute Loom with feedback you know and maybe you pay for maybe you have to pay for it each time and and and maybe you also get like a Google doc associated with it you know you put you probably have to because like maybe there's grammar or you know it's just easier I mean I write in Google doc so for me yeah it would be easier so I wonder if there's just like email and a Google doc around what another writer would do now why is that easier than what how you have it set up well you don't have to rely on like a live group hangout or a live one-on-one chat it's it's just you're offis skating away the marketplace so you're hiding it with an email yeah um it also probably is more comfortable for people to work async so another trend is just that people are they when it comes to online stuff they're they're actually prioritizing a way of synchronous stuff and they're moving more people prefer uh async when it comes to IRL inperson stuff they're they they prefer like iners events synchronous so I'm you what I'm doing is I'm shifting away uh Loom feedback Google doc Costco type membership right you need to pay every year probably not every month because I think also people are getting tired of this every month for something like this which is maybe not a must have is a nice to have but like for 200 bucks a year 300 bucks a year get get the membership get the email and I think that there's something to that I'm also I love the name feedback freak.com like I love it like I love the idea of like you're a feedback freak I just wonder if the hold Co is called feedback freak and the first product is called writing feedback freak.com okay yeah yeah totally uh yeah actually you hit on like that's ideally what the Grand Vision is to like be a feedback Freak app for all creative Endeavors like I think anyone that's starting out creatively they don't have a network they don't have anyone to kind of bounce ideas off of so it's partly like they need encouragement they also need like actual criticism and like as the world like sort of for better for worse tells everyone they should be a Creator as we kind of see online you know for better for worse um I think it's just yeah it's going to be more and more a necessity and if you can try to perfect him me my Grand Vision is like you know I'm really influenced by Rick Rubin right now I don't if you've seen him on podcast and stuff he's that yeah he's the man and like it's like he ultimately when you look at what he does you know he over oversimplifies it offices like I don't know anything about music I just really know what my tastes are and I'm able to communicate that to artists in a way that that they find useful and it's like he's ultimately just a really good feedback partner and like if you can could you figure out if you had enough data if you had enough people what podcasts lift to what do they read what they what are their objectives can you like could you Al Lally match people so that everyone has their own like Rick Ruben you know what I mean for any creative Endeavor would be like awesome but um that's yeah great great great feedback well so that makes a to ton of sense like like you said obos Skating the the marketplace and having that as a product like 24hour or 48 hour turnaround I love the idea how would you grow the marketplace you kind of have the you know chicken and egg kind of starting problem there I I mean to me it's it's it's simple like you start on Twitter you create an audience called write you know it's too long to say writer feedback freak yeah it would just be like um at writing feedback and you you literally just roast or rewrite popular like okay popular people's popular creators writing and you you write threads on it I love it and so you start doing that you build the credibility that way um and then like to me it's not it's not going to be hard to find the you know the writers who want to actually give feedback like the Looms because you'll just pay them um but you'll have bootstrapped via the the memberships so you'll have you're going to sell these one year memberships that's going to fund a lot of the um the payment for the initial people and then every time like I don't know how you have it but maybe it's every time someone asks for feedback they have to pay a certain amount or maybe in a year you get this is actually probably how you do it so you get a lifetime membership or sorry a yearly membership and with that you get a certain amount of credits call it 10 credits each time you on feedback you have to use you use one credit okay um and you know that you know um let's say you sell a credit for $30 maybe it takes someone 5 minutes so you pay them you pay the writer $15 you take $15 and the pitch to the writer is like I'm going to pay you a little bit but I don't even I don't even need to pay you because the amount of stuff that you're going to learn from doing this is going to make you a 10x better writer right you know what I mean but you know I'm just going to pay you because you know I want to keep you incentivized right show me the incentives and I'll show you the outcome so y um what do people think is this a sip or a spit uh is this what do you think of this idea and uh give Patrick a little a little feedback because he's a he's a feedback freak I might say yeah man I got I gotta give you a shout out too on the the name of you're like I saw one of your threads was like if you can would you put it on a T-shirt and that's how I was like oh yeah I'd wear a t-shirt it's said feedback freak so yeah I call that the T-shirt test yeah coming up with a name you know would you be would you proud to wear it as a T-shirt and uh you know that's oh you got a spit sadly you got a sad spit not just a spit you got a sad one by Victor I think it feels convoluted okay you got Evette gives you a sip so you got you got one sit and you got one sad spit come in the comment section anyone anyone else for a sip or spit um feel free to come in the comment section and we will send off Patrick to his offstage all right that's about it thank you for coming on appreciate it and uh later good luck and uh there you have it we now have 91 people in this you go okay you got a sip you got a l it 88 people here what do you think should I keep going we're 45 minutes through should I keep going I'm running out of sip I must say I'm running out of of of liquid here I'm running out of liquid so keep going keep going verum says yes Evette says keep going keep this train rolling baby Chris nice to see you again from yesterday it's interesting we're seeing a lot of repeat visitors no glato needed yes seeing a lot of repeat visitors if you were here yesterday feel free to go into the chat okay refill the mug I think that's fair I think that's fair I'm gonna go before uh Victor and Evette before I bring you on stage Victor first and Evette um I will fill this up but I have one quick ask for you if you're having fun feel free to share the YouTube link with your friends on Twitter on LinkedIn 91 people we were more yesterday so let's let's let's get more rest today it's free to share the link and it'll be more fun with more people all right be back in two minutes but I have a question should I be sipping tea or coffee I will accept whatever you tell me to sip should I be accept should it be tea or coffee now the tea is mint tea with fresh honey and the coffee beer wow beer coffee one of each insane coffee a lot of coffee the coffee is honestly instant coffee which is going to offend people wow it's a lot of coffee vodka both whatever you sipping choose the other one okay that's that's actually Fair okay we hit 100 people all right everyone um no instant coffee should I do the French press or instant coffee instant coffee King should I do the French press or instant coffee I'll do coffee but French press or inant coffee boy espresso I know I mean I have an espresso shop just down the corner but I don't want to leave you guys for too long French press all right we're going to do French Press I'm going to add to the stage Victor hi and Victor yes you're gonna have the stage for three minutes can I trust you with the stage oh yeah I'm gonna wreck it I'm gonna burn it oh I'm not gonna do anything I think I think I I brought the right people I I'm I'm 50% excited 50% frightened I'm after brunch sipping whiskey so oh my God we got the right person I might take five minutes I might take five minutes you know okay so get excited send some hearts for Victor uh he's gonna he's gonna talk about whatever he wants to talk about while I'm making french press um actually I'm going to apologize for my spit but here's why I did it is because I also run an app for writers um this is crazy I also run an app for writers um it's called Magic Book of fire and what and I've dealt with a lot of writers um I've dealt with a lot of writers uh coming in and the hardest thing to do is to get these people who are deeply rooted in art to go through a series of actions uh that get them what they want like the easier it is the easier it's like a button click that gives them a prize then then that is what people respond to more and I feel like I feel like if they have to go through um a a series of steps to get their feedback then I mean there's my cat dizzy by the way uh then you know that uh then you know that you have like some drop off I'm not uh Greg so I'm not really great at this uh but why am I here by myself anyway that's you are great Victor you are great you're up here with people you're doing great I'm just boiling some water and and I'm just hearing you in the background yeah and it's not easy so you know give it up keep going people are loving this look in the comment section people are loving this um cool oh you can hear me so maybe I should just tell tell you about what my idea is while you get your coffee or anything all right let's do it awesome great okay so the reason I'm here I'm a multi I'm a multipreneur uh I I accidentally got into being a multipreneur and one of my projects we just pivoted and it is I think about to blow up really big and I want advice on customer acquisition so here's what it is so I have this website um which is a video game website called high score game arcade if you go to highscore game arcade.com right now you'll see a game that I made for a brand uh for Joey Kramer from AOL Smith um I made a I made a game for his coffee brand um where I did a reimagining of the video game Tapper which is like this old 1980s game that Budweiser uh had where you would serve at a bar and I reimagined it as a coffee uh a coffee shop game anyway so then uh at one point we did an activation at a a live activation in person where we had a screen that was up and on the screen was a high score list and then people at the live activation could scan a QR code they go into a game on the web on their phone and then they play that game and then their names go up on the high scoreboard and this really worked really well and then so we changed this into a product and this is the product that is uh really about to blow up what we do is we'll go into a brick and mortar business where gaming works like say a sports bar you put up a leaderboard screen wait Victor we need the URL people are people are dying for the URL what's well the URL of the website is High scoregame arcade.com game arcade.com High scor game arcade.com and that's the URL where you can see the game that I made with uh uh Joey Kramer from AOL Smith his uh coffee brand cool I'm just going to share my screen real quick right rocking and roasting that's the name of his coffee amazing oh and then on July 1 uh you get you win a thousand dollars if you get the high score in the game very cool um so so this is the website the website works it runs on ads it and runs on ads and Brands nobody has to pay to play the game but you know like uh this is how the game works so in in person what'll happen is at a bar you'll see like a high score you'll see like a leaderboard and it'll it'll be like saying play it'll be a screen that'll say play this game you know win a $25 bab if you get the high score today okay they scan and then the game and they play the game and their name goes up on the leaderboard and it's highly interactive and we found that like 40% of people when they're told about this uh like will interact with it and then so these brick and mortar businesses gain all of these emails okay for they and gain local emails and then and then we own all the advertising space on the screens and at the end of the game so Brands want to be on the screens and on the game over screens with a clickable ad okay and then so and so when we approach when we approach places it costs them nothing the brand pays for everything okay so like if you've got a chain of bars we put this we put this leaderboard thing in your bar with games that we which games that we serve um and then a brand like say Coke will be like we want to be on all of those screen and so they pay for they pay for the activation the the spaces get money from the BR the the brand sponsorship some of that money goes to the spaces to pay for their daily prizes like the $25 bartab or whatever they want to give out and then the then the spaces get local email lists so it's like kind of like a win for everybody yeah um and then where and then where we are right now is we just started offering this because we kind of like found our way to this product and then the hardest part is talking to brands that have the money um it's just a world where I you know I I I'm not familiar with I mean i' I've kind of chipped my way into that world a little bit I found ways to get there if there's a better way say less it sounds like the vibe is you're really like you love what you do and you love building the games and you love and and that's like your passion and the dealing with the big Brands and finding them and getting in those rooms and doing those deals doesn't seem like it's exciting to you and something that it's your unfair Advantage is that correct uh I don't know what you mean by it's my unfair Advantage what do you mean well I think whenever you're doing a startup you do need an unfair advantage and when I don't I haven't known you for that long but it's clear that you're a really creative person like you you have you come up with really cool ideas and you put them into into life right and around gaming and art and music is that even just like looking looking in your background like that's the vibe I get yeah um there's literally a cat just like yeah it's perfect it's perfect so I think what you need so I like the concept yeah and you're also drinking whiskey at what time what time is it well I'm in New York we had brunch we already started so parties on today you know totally totally you're a rockstar you're a gaming Rockstar so I I like the idea I think it's interesting the idea of selling to brands also you know sounds like a big headache honestly I'm curious if people sip or spit this idea um feel free to put in the in the in the chat but I think what you need is do you have like an agency that represents you guys yeah we're talking to one we're we're so so uh I come from entertainment background which is actually I had a lot to think about when the guy was talking about video because I used to be a video a television producer most of my time um and then so uh about his many documentaries I think he's right on for that like Brands will absolutely love that and you do it right and you just plan it well and I think that he could knock it out of the park because you can keep your cost down that's beside the point um [ __ ] what was the question I'm so sorry I have ADHD do you work with an agenc do you work with an agency yeah yeah I have I have an agency for some of my projects but not this particular one but I am going to be pitching into agencies right now we what we do is I use the win mode database do you know what that is no I don't WI winmo W nmo is this database of all companies and all of their staff who who do marketing and sponsorship and it tells what their mandates are how much they spend what their spending is month by month in some cases um wow I'm gonna and and I'm going to give something very valuable to everybody here if you um depending on what city you're in uh the New York public so the New York Public Library gives you a free membership to winmo if you have a library card and it's worth 10 wmo's memberships are worth $10,000 a year no yes yes what exactly and then some and then I checked and then some other cities do the same thing I think Chicago does it as well so it's and and it's these it's a it's a giant database it's so valuable and you can get it for free through the public library Business Center in New York yeah I don't know what you all think but it feels like Victor is an angel and he's just come to bless us with his three tool what I found that transferred really well to entrepreneurship is that I used to be U for all those shows I was also a highlevel researcher and then so like if I like when we do do documentary shows I'd have to research and make sure that everything was 100% correct and so I'd find things in Crazy spaces and then so like that obviously translates um for entrepreneurship you could just find things that are useful okay I like it we got some quick questions for you and then we're gonna have to move on but our quick questions are someone Arian says sitp but why not charge subscription fees to the business instead like have you thought about that yes we have thought about charging subscriptions fees to the business however the the um the thing is I the the the long game is because every business wants this every Mort brick and mortar business wants emails of local people period yeah um if if I had the money right now I could fund this myself and just put it in every bar that said yes and then I would own all those screens and then it would be it would then then when we were in contact with Brands it would be just super easy because it's already it's already easy now the brands that we have gotten in contact with are very responsive to this already so that's why I'm just like digging to find out exactly how to reach people because it's when they know it exists when they know that they can be in these spaces and then and when they know that at the end the very game over screen is a is a clickable ad that they could own like the brands want it Jamal says dude I'm switching to Whiskey right now so you're again an inspiration and then Jam also says why not just affiliate with people who are already in the rooms you want to be in um I am trying to do that I for instance Buck Wild agency so I I have a contact through Buck Wild agency and they are an agency which has Brands and then so we already we already kind of got in with them because um one of my other Ventures is a is a TV show idea that I have a co-production deal and the company that I have a co-production deal with is represented by Buck Wald and so they're representing a TV show that I created and so that is like a kind of a weigh in this just happened last week so I haven't gotten chance to talk to them yet so I'm trying to figure it out cool and what's one quick question I can answer for you before we head out I just want actually actually one quick question that you could answer is um do you rem so I couldn't find when when you guys were talking about octop playay on one episode do you remember this episode uh I know so you know is though right the casin is the gaming the of cars and blah blah blah yeah we about with gambling yeah yeah and you guys were talking funny I've been approached by a guy who wants to do a gambling we're gonna do we may do some white label stuff here yeah I mean why not but um but when you're were talking about that um I also thought of monetizing through payperclick ads um just because if we have all these people playing these games we could monetize through paperclick ads and you mentioned um I wish I could remember what you mentioned do you like is there a better alternative to paperclick ads like if if I weren't gonna monetize with Brands how else would I monetize besides we talked about lead based we talked about like give me your phone number like you know give me your phone number give me your email address and um like we we talked about CPA cost per no CPL cost per lead is what we talked about so right companies which which pay for that and then that in Affiliates and stuff like that exactly yeah right I think that's the easiest sell versus trying to sell cost per click because then people are you know you're going to um a Chili's let's say Chili's restaurant and you're like hey would you you know would you pay a dollar a click and it's like um maybe um because then you're competing against Google and Facebook and stuff like that versus hey if I got you 25,000 email address addes and phone numbers in your local area would you give me $25,000 for that oh yeah all day long because they know that the lifetime value of a customer is XYZ and it's further down on the funnel right cost per click is at the top it's like all all it is is intent oh I have intent to go to Chili's that that's great and then you also reminded me one of the reasons that we weren't trying to charge uh monthly fees to these places because we have to educate them because a lot of these brick and mortar businesses they don't even understand e-commerce at all yeah totally so you don't want to do you don't want to do that it's it's harder to educate them um yeah thank you and before I just want to say second thank you because I did reach out to Dicky Bush because of your show okay um about my writing app and um and we're actually talking about doing something together which is awesome there you go thanks you know cont I appreciate it I appreciate it Victor you're awesome and you held it down you and the cat held it what's the name of the cat uh the cat that is dizzy I also have another cat named Miles okay dizzy I'm gonna give I'm gonna give the shout out to to co-host Victor and co-host dizzy um who held it down while I was brewing coffee you guys were just drinking whiskey and hanging out I appreciate it and thanks for Legends Legends later thank you boom all right we are going to bring patient evet on hey Greg can you hear me we made it yes we hear you wonderfully welcome to the stage thank you and thanks for um for doing this I think a lot of us are really appreciative um I'm actually reaching out to you from Miami because I no way I was born and raised here my parents live here I I have a house out in Naples now but um I still spend a lot of time so I'm at my parents house right now in Miami I love it yeah welcome back thank you um so a little background I'm from Miami I went to Michigan and I moved to New York City and then back to Miami you know where I'm from originally uh my background's in Consulting ernston young deoe um like implementing large Erp systems but I've been working for the man all this time and I really wanted to venture out and do something and so I have a lot of ideas um the one I want to talk about today is something I've kind of worked on a little bit more than the others but um nothing really totally fleshed out so what I'd like to do is I kind of um just if let me know if you can see I have a little just a little deck you know could you share your screen yeah I'm trying to I might not I don't know we've never done this you know we've never had uh someone do that but if you can okay oh oh wow I see your screen hold on I have to add it to the stage boom all right everyone see it cool we're we're we're live wait Journey all right you have you have a few minutes to go through it's only it's only one slide it's just something I just wanted some visuals so that we can actually look at something while we're chatting um so I wanted to share I needed to lose weight I still do actually but I wanted to build a community to make it fun and also to really monetize it so I was active between 20 22 2020 and 2022 um I wanted to start monetizing it via like being an affiliate ads YouTube Etc um so I own weight journey.com as well as the Twitter handle um and so I started a YouTube channel I recorded maybe about less than 20 videos I also have a Facebook landing page for it and um oddly enough Greg the reason this has kind of like started to come into my mind again because I I kind it kind of died after 2022 but the Facebook page recently every day gets like three likes and like subscribers it's it's subscribing by itself I'm not doing anything and I don't know what's going on with the Facebook I'm not I'm literally not touching it and so I'm thinking gosh I've got right now 624 people subscribed to this page um and I can continue posting onto there you know onto that page so you know it's kind of fertile ground I I lost a lot of weight with one product in particular one course and um but then you know after the pandemic ended up gaining some weight back so I'm thinking instead of putting so much pressure on myself to share this journey the idea is um like a spin-off idea and you know if you guys don't don't you know like this maybe if people have other ideas for other spin-off ideas I'd love to hear them but maybe a before and after app that would be really similar to Instagram but really solely for sharing pictures and stories of people's before and after so whether that's weight loss muscle gain Home Remodeling plastic surgery results things like haircuts um I purchased a few URLs that you see on the screen Shaz Shazam Max inspo for inspiration for people beforeand after.not is for that well thank you for sharing Evette this is legendary and uh the domain that you own way journey.com is an incredible domain do you know who tried buying it a few years after I owned it and then now they have a patent on it and I don't have a patent on it but I own the URL is the OIC company oh they tried byy yeah they they have a patent on the name but um I thought you were gonna say Weight Watchers who was one of our clients one of our old clients yeah that would make sense yeah um but OIC also sort of makes sense as well um what's your what do you want to get out of this to be perfectly honest I really want to work for myself that's and so um it doesn't have to it has to generate a certain amount of income to to have just a certain lifestyle but not a huge amount and so it's funny because I talk I read you know I follow you on LinkedIn I hear you talking about Millions I don't even have to be there to just really work for myself so it has to generate enough to just be comfortable um let's just say well under a million and so that's one two is I feel really passionate about you know weight loss and health and how people approach it and so I'm very interested and I think you should do something that you're passionate about yeah um because I've tried I've thought about other ideas but I'm not as passionate about them so they don't come as naturally so these are the things that I'm trying to get out of it and I know that the you know in general everyone's trying to look good and lose weight so it's a fertile ground but how do you tap into it you know well I think what what I'm missing from you is what I'm hearing at least is like a unique point of view on how [Music] to approach weight loss okay you know so I think to me the the Instagram before and after app like could it work yes but you know is that the best way to achieve your goals you know so many people come up with startup ideas and they're just it could be a good idea it could be a sip idea but if it's not really helping you get to your goal um and and and you create that and it's very hard to monetize like I have a buddy who created a Instagram for Fitness Enthusiast and it had millions of users and he couldn't it's like oh on paper it's doing really well but he could he had issues monetizing it and um you would think oh with millions of users of course you should be able to but then you're competing we talked about this with Victor a little bit then you're competing with um you're competing with meta ads so you're in the ad business and then you're competing against meta and Google and that's a very it's not a it's not a journey you want to embark on what I think is you know and I sound like a broken record but what I think what I think how I would approach it is like building an audience around weight journey and and and coming up with a unique point of view on how you approach that you know there has has to be some unique way that you're approaching it or you believe in or you partner with someone who has like a a scientific method or some way of approaching that you're like I really believe in this approach and I'm going to go create a paid membership like for me it's like super simple audience p uh with a unique perspective maybe it's like weight Journeys for people who follow Brian Johnson or people who are into keto or people into you know these are unique point of views um you know Dr Peter ARA then you can spend money to you know you build some audience then you can spend money to uh you know Target people who follow Brian Johnson Peter artia uh whoever it is oh [ __ ] Cody's here Cody is here Cody is in the building um and then I think it's you know you do a paid membership to beta test what you're doing like you build like a you know 20 bucks a month 5050 bucks a month you can sell coaching of course um but I still I I'm really missing the point of view I feel like you can't start anything until you're missing a point of view and don't I wouldn't be building an app I would be like you know building coaching and building a paid membership okay yeah you know Cody has some you know you know massive community of weight loss for sure um but I also think like you can just do a paid you can do a paid one a paid membership um sell access to chap OB via text like that's another idea which is like there's this bigger Trend around accountability and coaching via chat bots so if you can build the chatbot once and just pay and sell it 20 bucks a month there's an investment I made um in a company called vid IQ vid IQ is this Chrome extension does it's huge has millions of users it helps YouTube creators I have it on my YouTube yeah yeah get better at YouTube and they have a $99 a month um coaching product uh and they use the mine share they get from the Chrome extension to sell coaching and I think you can do a similar thing around like what is a free product that you can give away and then sell coaching and then eventually automate via AI okay Cody is saying you know we love Cody he's saying what should I eat on this yeah I think that's a big question that people have like they want to be able you know I had breakfast this morning and at this restaurant and it's like do I order the omelet do I or you know sausage or bacon like I need help um I should say I lost a lot of weight during the pandemic on this one diet and so I was an affiliate for it it's a protein protein sparing modified fast so I guess that was the niche initially um and it was a great affiliate it was like 80 paid 80% um for for the product but um but I I think maybe shouting that a little louder from the rooftops and I love the chat idea the chat GPT idea yeah as a also like that's the type of thing that you're gonna get pressed with so like press is like looking for stories around this chat oh my God this chat bot saved me you know I lost 25 pounds with this chatbot and tell you know you you know telling your story and and going out there and being like nothing you know nothing was working for me and um and I also just think so like coold dming all these journalists and being like here's my story and here's how chat GPT helped me here's this GPT help me getting is it like a chat is the idea like a chatbot GPT like cheerleader to help you on your do that the idea I mean like yeah I think like I think one of the it could be I think what you should do is actually write out if I you know take a piece of paper and write like bot in the middle AI bot and and be like okay what are the different ways an AI bot or AI coach could help could help someone who's trying to do what lose weight and it's like well accountability like right you know did you you know did you do XYZ today did you not eat carbohydrate you know did you not eat pieces of bread did you not have fries did you not do this I don't know um there's just general cheerleading yeah general just like make you feel good about yourself yeah um Cody says there's 99,900 searches per month for nutrition coach so there's tons of demand for people who are looking for these coaches um and there's not that many AI coaches available so now that's kind of an interesting play that's a great idea you guys like think about it as like a hub and spoke model like bought in the middle and just like what are the different things that come out to it and and come up with that point of view and I think that there's probably an AI idea here and there's probably a uh there's probably just like a paid yeah paid subscription you can do awesome thank you very much I appreciate it my pleasure thanks for coming up and love to see where you take it yeah all right Pat oh Patrick's already been on here all right that's basically it I think I think we're let me check my uh I think this might be it for today Cody I sent you the link if want to come up but if not we are going to end the stream early I'd love Cody to come on but he has to you know he's a busy guy I sent him the link let's see if Cody comes on he's oh he's jumping on Cody's on all right he's coming on okay so I'm going to [Music] bring bring some more people on so DM me on Instagram if you want to come up and we will bring you up okay Cody's gonna take five take your time Cody I'm just sending the link to people on Instagram actually ver my good question what are some business ideas that I have been on my mind lately I actually did a quick recording that I'll post this week with the one idea I've been thinking about um and I just decided to give it away so you'll see it on my YouTube this week you will see it all right while we're waiting for Cody feel free to DM me on IG at Greg Eisenberg and share the stream Cody's coming on you know Cody brought always brings the five he always brings the Heat and uh today will be no exception so share the link with your group chats share the link with your your husband your wife your girlfriend your boyfriend your friends and then go on Twitter and just screenshot this with the link let's get let's get uh some more people in here are you having fun are you learning are your creative juices flowing let's get that in the chat let's see let's see what uh what people are thinking okay Mythic has shared with um his or her AI girlfriend so that's pretty cool that's pretty pretty darn cool that's pretty pretty pretty cool this is better than Shark Tank oh okay wow you're here Cody what up believe I see you more than I see my own [Laughter] mother I don't know I don't have any response to that how was your afternoon last night how was your afternoon last night is what I said how how's your it was great man went to the park drank a bottle of wine we had the dogs played frisbee super chill then yeah went out and got a got dinner with some friends but anyway just working this weekend and saw you were online and you know naturally I I'm I'm a glutton for for punishment and this is a compulsion and so I have to do this um so anyway here you are uh can I go off on the nutrition coach thing real quick because I actually think this is a really good idea um I I I love I love these these consumer apps that are starting to come up that are basically like what's this really expensive service that only the the rich can afford currently um which is terrible to say about like mental health and like all this [ __ ] but uh that's the reality and then like how do I give an 80% as good version of that using you know clobber together AI tools I think there's a huge market for those types of things and the coaching space in particular like this is something that I think is huge you could probably do this in like business coaching and all these other things um we're actually starting to see this happen with like business coaches or just coaches in general where they're taking their whole back catalog of content then they turn it into a chat bot and they charge a subscription to it where it's like okay um I have this you know expertise knowledge and I'm going to basically um almost like pay wall gate it so for you to access it and what this does is instead of you know they're um it allows them to hit that part of the market that they normally couldn't you know extract any value from so like as a coach like traditionally you know you're servicing like 1% of your actual audience who can pay you whatever your price is you know 295 an hour Etc or whatever your monthly cost is but um for this you know for them what they can do is they can be like oh this is $20 a month you could access to all the knowledge all of my documents in this like way for you to like chat with it I think that same idea you know leveling that up and applying it to okay how do I spin this into consumer apps and that's what I think this nutrition one could totally be right it's like um a nutrition coach on average is 65 an hour in the US like if you can get that down to where it's like 20 bucks a month and I'm just imagining like you could be at a restaurant you send an image of the menu and you're like what should I eat off this based off of my goals right and it's like oh cool here's this like almost like you know live and person um you know nutrition coaching that's happening and uh it's funny we almost did this like two and a half years ago at a company I was working at um but and we were going to use like offshore talent to basically like you know train them on these protocols that these um professional nutritionists would make and then would like augment the nutritionist so they could have like these like live chat conversations but now you could just do the same thing entirely with AI so anyway but I have a I have a fun question for you so check this so Weight Watchers which is the OG totally weight loss company stocks down 95% of all time all time market caps about 125 million bucks if you are Weight Watchers what would you do if I was Weight Watchers um I think that them having their own Instagram with like it basically clone Instagram and it all it is is just like you know before and after pictures of people doing the thing and their Journeys and then like maybe you post their their stats like people can have their stats on their profile um but I think this this play is the same thing right it's just nutrition Co their their their game is a little bit different though right because like they're selling like prepackaged meals and like all these other kind of you know I'm just thinking about the like the drink like that physical product component of this um but I think that you could probably go after this Market with a lot of people just don't know like they have questions and they don't know what to ask who to ask or where to ask or don't have the like the um you know the the funds to basically afford that that professional coach like why why can Chris hamsworth go put on weight or drop weight like overnight right it's because he has a nutritionist a private chef and you know all these people that are behind them basically doing that so like I'm just imagining how do you do basically 80% of what that uh that person in public like that that public figure has access to like all these people how can you do that 80% in the background and you know I mean this can even relate into I'm at uh Trader Joe's as an example I'm like taking a photo of of one of the prepackage meals that are there or whatever and it's like asking my nutritionist my digital nutritionist like you know does this fit my meal plan like what how can I factor this in or what you know what should I do and so I think that's this uh that's how I would think about the Weight Watchers thing I have no idea because I I don't really know their business model that well do you know it uh decently Greg yeah I do and there's only so much I can say here because I've I've worked with with their team their executive team totally um but when you think of Weight Watchers they're like the they're like the OG of gamification literally 100% dude like in the 1980s um early 1980s I think they got started Oprah was like on the board and the idea was just like points point system for meals like calories is too complicated for the average American let's just do points and then Fitness and then basically community centers where they would do group wings like they would do like wings and and they you know so you have the totally the peeress and you have the community common so there there's these whole there's I think there's two crossover that I would do if I was in their shoes I would go have you seen this app it's called like Clear app or clear get clear app.com went through YC uh I I randomly stumbl on the founder on Twitter she was like dropped out of Oxford or something to go build this thing it's kind of gangster so I don't know some some you know traditional path but um basically what it is is people like test they they they put in their different skin like qualities like in my dry skin in my whatever and um there's this whole subset of of community that like this micr community that exists around like skin routines right and basically testing skin routines based off of like what your you know your your um kind of natural complexion your your natural like you know fa skin basically like how it how it functions right right so what I mean just thinking about this but then applied to weight loss is the same idea like here's my body type here's this whole thing there's this so I think there is this space for like these micr communities and showing the before and after um I I just don't know like the CH the challenge with this is always how do you to your point like cut through the noise like what they're doing here is they're riding a wave that's happening already right so like it's like skin skincare and skin routines like face skin routines are becoming more popular currently so they're just like going up with that um but that like I guess the weight loss thing maybe it's just something that's always happening I don't know I weight loss is hard man I don't I don't know consumer that well you know this totally yeah I will say one thing on that on that get clear website they have a quiz that you can take there's a little quiz talk to me about how you think about quizzes as a way to get interest I I think about it is like you're getting buyin without people knowing that you're getting buyin right so like if you do you know you spend 15 minutes doing this quiz and then they ask you for your email at the end like a lot of the times people feel this investment that they they've just like gone through and so it can be this really powerful lead magnet especially if there's like an educational component that's provided at the end so like we did this in the past um I was doing some work for a company in the women's health space and we had this uh basically like a quiz that like once they answered all these things it would build this like custom plan for them right based off of their responses super simple logic nothing complex or like interesting but but like again it would take you you know we'll say 10 minutes to go through this whole thing so it was actually a lot of information and what we'd see is like this super high conver it also you know if a person is that far down this thing like they have just shown you all of the re like they have a huge need for whatever the product is that you're you're offering whatever that quiz leads to um so I think it can be a massively gent thing it's just again figuring out how do you get that top of funnel uh to like get people there but then it can be like you know can you get at the end of it can you get people to share out to other people to see what their results are um you know that type of thing but anyway dope we're gonna bring Paul on let's do it Paul what up how you doing Paul what's good how's it going guys good man how you doing good good um thank you thank you for taking my um taking this on um the idea here is um really just I guess you could call it a door Dash type app for car repairs and the problem you're solving here is trying to quickly identify um shops that can take on you know either transmission change or um an inspection and the focus there is focus regionally and locally right so you start our really small moment shop mechanic shops and you know if I need an ail change or if I need my tire replaced go into this application um and essentially have the businesses compete based on price and service and then I can make that selection and schedule schedule that service over the phone and so you know from my from I don't know if I want to call it an app or website but from the business side um you sort of you know you take a percentage from linking both parties together here so that's that's the general idea yeah um so two questions come to mind um so this sounds like a Marketplace play which is always super hard um so it's chicken and egg problem you have to get one side of the marketplace and have some type of um Arbitrage that you only have or you only see with that so for you it's it's auto dealerships and then people or so you know you know car owners um what I imagine this probably serves the car owner more when you have like this bidding war happening right um and so the but the dealers are going to be against this right so that's going to be the uphill battle with this type of thing unless you get so much volume on the consumer side that they have to be there um because that's where people are going right so like door Das is an example like why you door Dash has a ton of these users on the consumer side if you talk to a restaurant owner hate door Dash they don't want to use it they want nothing to do with it right because it cuts in the margin but because so many people are there they have to be there component of this and then the other question I'd have is around like how what percentage of repairs Could Happen uh like mobile like could it because maybe it's just pulling out a subset of this where it's like you know whether it's uh like windshield cleaning or you know I I don't know anything about about the space but it's like hey we have these three product offerings and that's the you know these are the three things that we do we do at a way cheaper price and it's you know I almost think about it as a business in a box then for some guy that's working at Jiffy luo and he's like oh I can go you know I can do these three things all day long and make more money doing you know going out and doing this uh an example of something that reminds me of this is my friend's a paramedic um and he runs like a an IV business on the side and he like makes more money from his IV business like just like you know doing uh like IVs for um uh like bachelorette parties he makes more money from that than like his job working for the government as a firefighter so thinking about but again so he contracts out to a company he's like licensed to do photomy right just with his his his job his work but he contracts out to a company and they're basically almost like this broker for this so I'm imagining you guys could you know fit into that same type of of role where it's like oh we know that we can service people anywhere they are with these three things or whatever you know your product offering is and then going to you know these other guys where it's like oh your day's off you can do a half day and may you know what you would make normally from two days of work at this other other job but anyway yeah just brained up I don't know yep my uh my quick take on it so when yeah I like Cody because we've we've built a lot of stuff I feel like whenever I hear Marketplace I'm like allergic a little bit um the way I would go about solving the problem would be by creating a directory of uh car mechanics so I would actually think about how could you you know everyone not everyone but a lot of people have this feeling that you're getting screwed uh when you work with a car you know some car mechanic like oh they're selling me more than than I you know I don't really need to change those break pads or whatever it is so I think that I can think of like the leading place where I can go and look at reviews and ratings totally yeah for for car mechanic shops and I think that opportunity is just huge and I'd start with that and build the SEO juice and and then eventually go to where you want to build okay so in in that in that Avenue your your I won't say Corner the market but you're getting a you're building a database of trusted car shops from that exactly you're you're building the the marketplace before building the marketplace you know exactly yeah and that's the challenge you have to find one side of this right um but so like my friend is building this company it's called finders fee um it's basically like a Marketplace for people to go find luxury goods um and they have like imagine like this Army of people that like just go out they're kind of just um uh I've seen like the luxury watch Tik Tok like that whole category so it's like imagine those people but in every category like in cars in like private jets and like I want to rent a yacht that type of thing right um so for him like his strategy was like he basically own Tik Tok you uh YouTube shorts and Instagram reals and he would be like this person just made you know uh $2,000 by finding this this car in this random location here's how he did it he went to finders fe.com blah blah blah but what I'm what I'm trying to talk about here is you have to figure out some type of um like what which side of the marketplace you're going after basically to from from day one I'm again so when I was working at this company called Rupa Health this is we were a Marketplace we were technically a three-sided Marketplace which is even gnarlier but we had practitioners we had patients and we had the labs that we were working with right so we had all when you're you know in that Marketplace space like you're basically having to service every one of those customers and so for us we saw that the path forward was like okay we're going to hyperfocus on the practitioners and on the patients and because they're like related and they were being underserved so we could basically um uh assist the practitioners with the patient management and then we could make a better Pro uh product for the practitioners then what that leads into is like if you get enough practitioners on the platform you suddenly have leverage with the labs that you didn't have previously like we couldn't go in and negotiate with them in the beginning right so for you for again for marketplaces a lot of the times it's like okay how do I get leverage on one sides of this Marketplace and then go and figure out that you know that other side with paid for for what you're talking about is probably going to be like I think GRE what Greg said is brilliant of just like this massive directory there is no brand right like there's no website that I would go to right now that would be like you know measuring mechanics against each other of like from on a trustworthiness basis and that's a huge I mean first time you know first thing you do when you move to a new city right is like you reach out to somebody you know there who's your mechanic that you like that like you trust currently right and so Imaging how do I build that digital version of that but anyway yeah know that was the key that sport that sported this I remember going to a mechanic shop and wanted me to do something and it turned out I could do it from from YouTube in 10 minutes and he was charging me $75 right so that's how this came about um from the GGO so um Greg appreciate yeah that that sort of change in Direction here in sort of how to how to address this no worries y yeah I appreciate it thanks Paul thank you guys all right we're gonna do one last one before before we head out and we're gonna bring up the lovely Joe she's back sweet good afterno good morning guys good morning m good morning Cody how are you doing well how you doing great great great thanks for having me back up um I sent Greg and it's like so it's just so serendipitous and there's so much Synergy within this community that Greg has built because the ideas that I I sent over to Greg someone literally was just kind of in the pocket in the same vein with some of the things and so the one I sent you over too but I think I'll talk about the first one which was creating a bot and just just let me go over to my idea board so I can give you oh you're our type of person you know you got an idea board you I definitely do okay so because I'm such a YouTube holic like my son is 13 I'll probably meet him one day um he's like get off of YouTube between yelling at the politicians and studying and researching so what I've been doing my phone is full my iPad's full my extra phone cuz take screenshots of the videos that are up next because I might want to watch them but I have Greg that I need to watch I have Cody I need to watch before I go to these new people and so I was trying to find a way to curate you know by taking a picture and then it can curate the name of the video who the YouTube channel a brief description of the um of the video so you can have that curated list and go back to and have something to WR reference so that was one thing that I was thinking about it might not be useful for everyone but for people with ADD or ADHD it's good because you're like Oh shoot what was that guy's name that I wanted to watch he was talking about something and so instead of me having to take a picture and then going and writing it down and or talking to my phone or my you know so I was figur trying to figure out a way to build an app that you know and my my I have I have 50 million domains so mine is one of mine is you can sell that you can sell that.com because I I believe you can sell everything I started my first business when I was seven years old and I hadn't stopped I've been corporate and everything like that and based on I have to just get my stuff together because everyone globally knows me but I don't have any real internet presence other than real estate because that's been my my sweet spot but that was my one idea we get what do you guys think sip or or no G what what's your thoughts I mean I have a lot of thoughts on this so I don't know if you know this Joe but almost 15 years ago I built a video discovery app on top of YouTube and it became extremely popular it was sold to stumble upon which at the time was one of the largest social networks and it was all about curation of video kind of looked like this it was like Tik Tok before Tik Tok but it would be like Wednesday morning what are you in the mood to watch and would hook up to your YouTube subscriptions so it would know what you watch and what didn't watch and you'd be able to save those videos and then you'd be able to have these communities and group chats around these videos and unfortunately I think we sold two too early um I think that the problems around video curation is huge I think you can if you picked different categories right like uh creation for like there's probably um hold on let me mute you for a second because I hear myself cool there's probably uh like curated videos for people who love startup ideas curated videos for people who uh are growth experts curated videos for people XYZ I think you start with that like you start building email lists around and websites around curation of videos and you do curated videos and you the way you videos is probably mostly through AI based on certain uh you know creators YouTubers are like this also people who like you know Cody Schneider also like XYZ people and then you you basically say that okay once a video gets a certain amount of views then it like pushes into the system um I I think you could do it with categories too just to pay you back off of that um so like if you go down like local real estate rabbit holes you'll see this it's actually crazy there's like all these creators that are like here's what I'm seeing in you know Boise Idaho for you know XYZ like you know basically on the front lines like what they're seeing right um I know tons of realtors that all watch this and consume this but it's like 15 minute long videos talking about how this relates to what the St Louis fed is saying and all this stuff um there's this company I'll drop it in the Stream it's called like podcast not.org um basically how it functions is you they you like subscribe to these podcasts and then they build you a custom newsletter based off of what you're subscribe to with that output so I'm just imagining like you doing the same thing where it's like uh you know you you they would they would be able to put in a YouTube channel um and oh that's funny we're there uh so you put in like a YouTube channel uh basically anytime that a video drops like you just Bas you take the transcript you turn it into the key takeaways or whatever the learnings are the insights are and then every for every person it's like they basically have that output but I think the small version of this at a small scale is like probably just taking long form content media how do I make that smaller and then build these micr communities or you like the communities that already exist how do I make a thing that that basically Services them and have it be you know the skim but at the smaller scale I think that's something that probably I I just know a lot of professionals would want like I know like I mean why AI newsletters and all these other things take off like it's because of that right and yeah I don't know I I I think there's probably something in in that of just like you know selling people basically back their time you build an audience and that turns into okay I sell a product to them you know whatever that ends up being or just a subscription like like podcast notes is a subscription I think it's 99 a year and you get act like you basically can subscribe to whatever these shows are and you get that recap on a weekly basis right they're 100% doing that with AI it's you know 100% automated I think that same thing can be done um for you and maybe it's just like the MVP of this that I would probably go after is like picking some type of category again like maybe it's local real estate maybe it's like local business news maybe you know whatever whatever that is that you have some type of knowledge in or some some insight um and seeing okay can I get people subscribed to this when it's like a recap of everything that's happening um and I mean what's great with this too is you can piggy back off of these creators um and and like what I mean that's why you see these like Clips channels blow up right that are like oh they're all they're doing is just repurposing all-in podcasts or like repurposing humman clips and and these channels goes because they're piggybacking off of the uh the uh Fame that these individuals already have you could probably do this in the same way where it's like um you know get a recap of these 10 different creators of like what happened in the last week it's probably going into like the educational category though rather than entertainment like I don't need a recap of a Mr Beast video but I would I you know but somebody would probably want to recap of like here's what we're seeing uh within like even local government in this area of like a you know a YouTuber that's talking about that and with the recap that happen so anyway thank you Cody I think that kind of morphs into and let me I have this I have billionaire book club so I take you know books like crushing it or jab jab you know knock knockout and everything you know Gary whoever it might be and I condense it and I have videos where that people have a subscription to so they get these billionaire it's the billionaire book book club and all the books are condensed with the finer points and then with each one they also get like you know a spreadsheet or something a checklist or something or actionable tools so do you think that I should kind of marry this into that or would you keep it separate I think it's I think that's the bigger idea what's that what's that app Greg that's like the book app that's uh it's audio books but they're like 10 minute Clips I I'm trying to find the name of it what is it blinkink yeah blinkist yeah I think it's the blinkist idea but just remix for like a different category um like even if honestly probably what you could do is like every YouTuber that's in we'll say like the oil and gas space or some some industry that's like you knows like big money and they're just on there talking about you know that whole industry or even all the podcasts are in that you know everything that's in that if you just had like a Roundup email that was for that whole industry um I think that those like you could build I know I know you could build a new that out in that space super quickly um because again what you're selling back to them is basically the the espresso version the distilled version of this long form content um which provides you know you're saving them time right that's the that's the whole concept of what you're selling there that's the promise that you're making and then you can do this at scale now with AI that you never could before and then the phases of this is super easy right it's like a a really manual version of it to begin with in a specific industry and then that levels up into okay cool now you can select the different channels um and then you know basically you can kind of stair step up into oh now we have this whole custom thing where it's like you drop in a YouTube URL and we build you basically a custom newsletter about every video that dropped on that channel over the last week uh with the you know the five top insights from this or whatever that ends up being but yeah I also think the name billionaire book club like that con in the story behind it is just so powerful so I love that idea um Joe thanks for coming up thank you guys again for having me appreciate you see you soon see all right Cody you've been kind this is it everyone it's been real what what do you how long you been on here right now almost two hours oh my god dude yeah dude it it it literally flies by totally I been it's so fun I think I'm going to take the the yesterday one and just chop it up I I I guess bail and stuff this is honestly such a fun segment and just like have people like pop in like friends that are like I don't know they come in for like 30 minutes and yeah just give their insight and then bounce out I I I just it's almost like talk radio in this weird way yeah I was thinking of maybe doing it for like eight hours like literally pick like a Wednesday and be like all right all day yeah and have like scheduled segments to be like all right now we're having blah blah blah on they're here from you know the top of the hour until the end totally yeah that would be super funny um yeah I what you could do probably too is then have those people like Pro cross-promoted across their um their socials so it's like yo I'm I'm you know joining Greg's live stream at 9: to 10 um you know come yeah anyway super interesting this whole idea and concept is just really because a lot of the times too it's like how do you get um people that have like a lot of experience to think about these ideas or like you know I I am like obsessed right now with this YouTube thumbnail thing that we talked about yesterday I think that's such a good business idea um and like I never would have thought of that right unless we talked it was it Yash I think his name was yeah he was cool he was super for people who didn't listen to that you should really just rewatch that segment probably about two hours in Yash that guy was Top Shelf 100% just how he's thinking about it super interesting like taking a business model that already exists and applying it in a different place like that's actually what really good entrepreneurs is they just like they cross over between these different categories with the knowledge that they've acquired from some some other or they're just taking something that somebody's done before them and like turning it into something new and he was young how old was he I have no idea there there I don't know there's just Killers out there like that now though they like they're like stumbled in a Discord community and they were you know running like casinos on on uh like World of Warcraft or whatever and they're like oh now now I'm going to do this because it's real money you know like he was anywhere between 18 and 38 100% 100% I love it all right there you have it another live stream that was fun thank you for joining it's been real if you enjoyed this of course you subscribe to the YouTube channel um you can go to Greg eisen.com and subscribe to my email newsletter you'll get weekly sort of framework on how to win on the internet and then for people who think about the ACP funnel uh you can just go to interested in the ACP funnel just go to community empire.co and uh there's a free course you could just grab and talks more about that um so there you have it folks it's been real later

gonna Jam live okay um I haven't tweeted this out yet this is just for YouTube right now I'll probably throw up a tweet in a bit give us a few minutes as we get started um this is the first time we're doing this hi Greg our school will be in the same price is there a chance for lower yes the school is the price but here we're here to talk about startup ideas you know all right send a message to Greg Eisenberg on at Greg Eisenberg on IG cool you get a private link and I'm gonna send h a quick tweet um I'm gonna send a tweet that we're we're live and I hope you're enjoying your Saturday Jordan what are you up to today I am chilling with the fam and going to a wedding tonight um so probably have some startup ideas from from throwing a throwing a party uh or being at a party was in New York all week this week and went to several IRL events and how to run an in real life event there was tons of ideas uh that that came to mind so we're going to have to uh we're going have to think about those totally what is up in here to get some juicy ideas yes oh yeah give Jordan Jordan give me a little introduction and get tell us what the two thing the biggest things you learned this week yeah um Jordan I'm a operating partner at late checkout um engineer by training kind of marketer by Nature been working with Greg for about a year and a half now building and buying internet-based businesses powered by community and Saucy ideas biggest things I learned this week is curation and reducing the friction to connect in real life really is so beneficial to make things happen and networks the value of networks to be extracted that was very prominent this week um because we are in New York with several Live Events and you know you just got to break through the ice otherwise unless you're unless you're not um unless you're being introduced by the people putting on so if you're putting on an IRL event just reduce that friction to to get everybody introdu introduced and make things happen um what's the second thing I learned this week I don't know nothing's coming them on okay well we got 35 people in here I just tweeted it out so let's wait until we get about 75 people 80 people and then we can get going it might take take another five minutes or so um so get your startup ideas going you can have this in the background you can be on the YouTube chat uh this is easy listening the goal of this is to really get your creative juices flowing and you might find an idea on the stream that you might run with and you might actually that could be a side project could be your main thing could be just something you learn you know i' I've done projects where just a little side project hey I want to learn how to use streamyard like this is kind of a you know a side project we're using streamyard right now um to to push this live and uh it's just it's new it's a project so um that's what today is designed to do and Saturdays are good for that are they not they're amazing for that what are you talking about that's what they're for we just watched even P2 2003 awkward Onyx to figure out how to go live on streamyard and to allow YouTube comments to pop up so thank you Stephen 2005 2005 baby oh Rafa in the house what up Rafa if you're bored and you want to come and I can give you the streamyard link no worries just DM me if not enjoy your Saturday as a as a as a commenter um this is great I'm loving how do we feel about the new do with uh hat sample that we got um the hat that you're wearing yeah I mean do do things I mean you you you tell people what that is yeah do this this is a little hat sample I've been cooking up so it's cut cut and sew for my little brand do within do cool things with cool people and cool places so I'm excited about I'm excited about the cut I don't know let me hear hear what you guys think stream this is about iteration sample number four I think it's dope I think um you know you know a trend I'm starting to see more is just restaurants having merch I feel like every not every but a lot of restaurants are are doing merch right now and I feel like there's a business idea [Music] around merch in a box for restaurants who don't have merch yeah what do you think what do you think of that idea yeah I love that and and you could you could find those restaurants with or or partner with like Google my business basically and run like the Google My Business Review Playbook with so that could be like the outbound strategy and yeah I love it I just found this brand actually in New York it's called dinner service and they basically collab with uh concert venues and restaurants and do like limited uh collection drops like really well-designed stuff with the restaurants so not not exactly the same but I think there's a big appetite for where people go and hang they want to to to wear and tell it about it so yeah that's it I love that Trend what do you think of the what business model you know what do you think it should be if you're starting yeah I'd probably do like a 3pl like a third party Logistics play where you take a you have a markup on the good but also a markup on the shipping as well so the restaurants don't have to actually deal with any of the inventory but you could be like a Drop Shipping third party uh Logistics um supplier for these restaurants and it could even help with design so it would be a percentage of Revenue plus shipping and fulfillment so you got you got kind of three three tiers of uh monetization there what do you think about that um I like it um I wonder if there's just like some rev share that you can do with with restaurants you know it's like hey let's just say um I had lunch at this this restaurant around here and it's one of those places that is like a landmark place that you kind of expect them to have merch but they don't because it's been family run for so many years and uh they they probably just don't want the hassle of of managing it so I think going to them and being like hey oh and I think the other thing to note is these people protect their brand like no other so I think for that you know what you can do for them is say hey we'll manufacture it well we won't do anything without your approval on designs which is kind of a headache but that's a part of this business um and and then we'll just split the profits 50-50 um and we'll and we'll do drops too right like so for example you know it's Father's Day coming up and it's like we'll do a Father's Day drop and you don't have to do anything but I think the only way to do it also is if you pick restaurants who have email lists and big and Instagrams and and actually in this region where I'm at they actually still use Facebook um and you because you you wouldn't want just to rely on foot traffic for for for the point of sale yeah exactly yeah it would have to be you have basically the samples are like a limited inventory inhouse and everything else was was Ecom yeah totally well you've been kind enough to join and set this up I know you've got a million things to do um it's been real thank you Jordan J mix Jordan mix Twitter um do do dope things with dope people and dope places that's it baby I can get behind that yes sir we know yeah all right have a good one peace guys cool all right everyone we we've got Quorum you know what that is startup ideas brainstorm you bring the ideas and I'll bring you up and we can jam on it and you don't have an idea no worries you just come up with what you're working on and I will give you feedback so how does this work this works like this uh here's the ground rules number one I want that chat going 247 because the chat is my connection to you and to and and and let's me know that this is worth continuing to stream so the chat's going I know that I should continue to stream the chat's quiet I know that this isn't Fun for anyone and we can all you know do something else on our Saturday so um I thought this would be a lot of fun just to to jam um but let's get that chat going everyone let's let's Pump It Up that's number one number two for your idea the way to submit your idea the way to come on stage is you are going to send me your idea via Instagram uh Instagram DM and I am going to for the top ideas I'm going to send you a link and the link it will allow me to bring you up on stage um so that's that's what we're going to do uh last time we streamed unfortunately I couldn't bring anyone up and I think that sucked so this time is different um so for you for those of you who don't know uh my my Instagram it should be a pin comment but it's Greg Eisenberg um DM me at Greg Eisenberg with your startup idea or what you want feedback on and I'll just sort of quickly go through it and the last but not least thank you Jordan the last but not least can we share this on Twitter um can we just like start pumping this um Twitter's been like suppressing algorithms lately and it's just it's lame so here's the tweet my last ask I just want this to be fun I want this to be a lot of people I want this I want you to have an audience and I'm looking for retweets I'm looking for likes and I'm looking for replies I need like a like isn't even going to just do it because uh you know here's a tip for you what's working right now on the Twitter algorithm is is replies the more replies you get the more it's like love to the algorithm um retweets and replies are what's What's um what's being optimized right now so I'll wait for you to click that link and start dming me and I'll be back in two minutes I'm going to make a coffee and I'm not I'm not doing I'm not until we get a hundred 100 plus people I don't want to bring anyone on stage so let's wait until we get 100 plus people and I encourage you to bring something to sip on bring something to sip on sip sip you know what it is startup ideas podcast uh get your sips on get those retweets get those replies and get ideas DM at Greg Eisenberg e e e a few things to sip on so if you know I've got my coffee and I'll drink that up into hundred people then if we get to 200 people I'll drink this nonalcoholic Budweiser and then if we get to 300 people I'll drink this a Caesar you know what a Caesar is it's a bloody mary but in Canada instead of tomato juice they put Clamato juice which is clam juice no one wants to drink that no one wants to drink that but if we get to 300 I will do that so without further Ado I'm going to check my Instagram and uh let's see uh let's see what some of your ideas are I've only got one dm so we are going to bring the 1 DM uh on here I'm going to send you the link and uh we'll make it happen just figure out do this end it over so Joshua Creed get ready to open up your DMs cuz I'm inviting you you know quaff your hair put on a t-shirt do whatever you need to do come on because we want to hear your idea we want to hear your idea and for those of you who don't know again you're just joining us uh send me a DM okay we got some more more DMS are coming in hot right now Paulo yo Greg here for the live that DM is not no I need more than that I need more than that why what do you what do you got what's the fire that got what do you need help with or what startup idea do you have um all right there's another guy I'm going to send the link to his name is I think Molin is his name and we will we will bring him up again just send the DMS okay they're coming in hot they're coming in hot I'm sending I'm sending the link people are joining I think people are GNA join get those DMS coming come on all right you know it's getting big 72 people get up on stage put on your t-shirts get your sips read in DM get ready to come up on stage Ryan Cassidy I got your DM prepare to come up on stage click that link uh you might want to click it on desktop I don't know and we were going to bring you up all right the DMS have been set oh boom Joshua is in the house there he is all right Josh we need you to close the YouTube link there you go got it welcome yeah thanks for having me what do you got for us uh yeah it's something that I've been thinking about for a while it's it's uh taking QR codes that are kind of dumb and making them smarter um we all know that you can have like a dynamic QR code right and that's just sending a sending you to a forwarding link right so that way the link can be whatever I need it to be in the future it doesn't have to be one thing um but what's really missing from the equation is the ability to contextually know a little bit more about the person so like anybody that scans from their phone can have one experience but if you create create uh multiple scanning end points then basically you could put it at a kiosk or a terminal and the same QR code that you might use for say like a digital business card uh you could use with your employees to like maybe HR could see like what's going on with their uh with their you know health insurance or or what's going on from there like it could be an access point for a lot of different things so I like the the idea of being able to take that one code and and do infinite things with it and then for even bigger brand take that one code and resell scanning in points to third parties so if coch puts a QR code on every single can and I want to create an app that does something with that I could go to Koch's platform and say yeah I want I want you to deliver me X Y and Z like people are really into like tracing their food so like um I've got a traceability app and I you know would love if you would provide me with data that's related to that from the same QR code what's the goal of your like what is the goal of this idea like you know are you trying to build a cash flowing business do you want to go build something big are you looking to learn yeah uh definitely learn a little bit more but also uh I think it would be just like I want to be Upstream of every QR code ever made like it's kind of silly to me that people charge by the QR code like it's a free technology why would you do that other than to like get a little bit of analytics and you know a little bit of like styling on your QR it could do a lot more than that um I can see it helping in um in a few different Industries too like um there's a little bit about this already on um Inventory management and and seeing where things are going through the loop like it would be nice if if the same QR code that I did to warranty my fridge you know if they printed it on the fridge that I could go back and scan it and find water filters and uh somebody to come in and and help me or they send me a you know recall notice or something it needs to be serviced like it would be great if I could do everything from one QR code okay we're going to do something we're going to do something fun here okay you ready for it for feedback on this so everyone in the chat if you like this idea if you think it's a good idea I want you to type in in caps locks sip siip but if you don't like the idea I want you to type spit spit you're either sipping or you're spitting before I give my feedback Post in the chat do you love this idea do you sip that idea or do you hate this idea do you spit that idea and don't be you know feedback this is a feedback zone right Josh Josh is a big boy he's okay with it look at him right Josh are you okay with this yeah one of many ideas we getting we're getting some sips okay validated or not it's okay okay okay sip spit you got your first spit oh some spits you you know you go you're getting some spits all right don't be don't be afraid Don't Be Afraid build up a bit to sip on okay okay that's fair that's fair so sip you're getting a sip okay so whenever I hear the word major brand I just get a little bit scared and the reason I get scared is you know we we you know for example we have a Innovation agency we work with the largest brands in the world and the sales cycles for some of these big Brands is difficult so these are one of those ideas that I think again I think this idea should exist but and I'd love to see it exist but I think that getting the big Brands unless you have an unfair Advantage with the big Brands I'm not sure I personally would do this idea so the go to market I'd have to find a different ICP for it to be exactly yeah okay yeah so think I would say think about the ICP um and see if you can make it a bit easier to get to it's like I was pitched on a education business this morning who uh the founder was telling me about his business he's built an incredible product but he's selling it to universities and colleges and selling to to that group is very difficult it's kind of a similar thing it's like selling to governments and I think big brands are also in that category I mean probably not as bad as governments and um universities but it's still tough there's some people that are a little bit Downstream um and they're kind of Downstream from government regulation and they seem like a interesting potential ICP interesting like um wine producers in the EU have to put QR codes on their stuff and you've got companies out there charging $100 a month for like 30 QR codes and so like there's obviously is they're they're kind of making it pretty lucrative and all it does is provide information that they have to provide and the FDA in the US has come out with a food traceability act for Farmers that they're going to have to comply with uh starting in 2026 so you know there's that angle where you could like help kind of the underdog the smaller people that are just like trying to do their thing they they've done forever but now they have these like new government regulations on them that's right that's right so I I think you got what you needed you got a good idea you got a sip idea but it's uh it's just got to ship that ICP so thank you for coming on by the way shifting ICP doesn't mean you don't end up with big Brands later just means that your initial ICP isn't big Brands yeah um oh nice you got some good feedback from Zach Zachary that is so much better than the original pitch sip boom all right Josh thanks for joining uh if you don't mind please leave the stage because we can only have so many people I should leave that browser I have so many people on here and uh it's been nice uh sipping with you yeah thanks again there you go that was cool um next up we're gonna bring up Ryan Cassidy to the stage uh Ryan just Clos the YouTube thing so we don't hurt the make people's ears bleed and let's see what he's got hey how's it going Greg oh the founding engineer well still currently yeah uh I currently work for a fintech in London but I'm based in medine so quite far away waking up very early and uh yeah I've been Keen to start my own thing for a long time now so I've partnered up with one of my ex colleagues to essentially build out one of the ideas that you and Cody spoke about yesterday yeah so essentially it's basic well I'm very bad at pitching but I'm gonna try give them give them give them some a round of applause in the chat it's coming up here it's not easy uh we've all been there and we appreciate you coming up um thank you um so yeah essentially what I'm building is uh we want to automate customer support using AI agents and also plug in like function calling and other things like that so the ability to make bookings reservations like very very basic Elementary stuff when it comes to um making use of llms um but the struggle is is we're too Engineers you know we're good at engineering when it comes to the marketing side of things it's quite difficult to approach and there's so many different angles that we could go at so for now we actually have a very basic MVP that's very general but we want to really Niche down and find our Market um so I was looking some for some advice on exactly how to do that and how to approach Outreach and um yeah one of my ideas at least was um build a customer Advisory board at least to begin with and they don't necessarily have to be customers but people that like the idea of the product and want to work with us in order to develop it and find a really really good use case for it so yeah I was just curious what you thought about that who uh who would be the can you just give some examples two three four people that would be amazing um to have or even just type of customer if you don't want to name someone specifically um well I actually work at a fintech right now and I think it would be quite interesting because I understand like the compliance and the regulatory side of things and being able to solve for something like that and maybe being able to call up for example transfer wise and get an update on your balance from an AI agent would be really interesting um but again like fintech and Healthcare it comes with those strict regulatory requirements so we want to maybe approach for example something simple to begin with like car dealerships you know something like that um but yeah I mean I know I know fintech well but outside of that is like you know and I understand the compliance and regul regulatory requirements at least in the UK where we have to deal with the FCA have appointed representatives and things of that where it can be very difficult and um yeah I think what's really interesting about focusing on fintech or car dealerships is what I found is both those groups uh both those Industries they kind of follow each other so what I mean by that is all the car deal a lot of the car dealerships whatever software one of them is using they're going to copy each other um and it's one of those things that if you can hit critical mass with a group of them uh you're able to build a Big Moe so for example we we uh we partnered with an agency that um that most their clients were in the fintech space and they were doing mobile app installs for fintech and it just it was so easy to yeah we don't really talk about it publicly but um it was just one of those things where they they buil you know you you work with public.com and then you work with another one and then you work with another one and then they all just you have the case studies and you've built that credibility a lot of these businesses are about building credibility and the product itself a lot of the time isn't it's almost like beer you know what's the difference between a hinin and Corona I mean not that much at the end of the day it's still still wheat and water so if I were you I would think about what is the vertical that you think makes the most sense it sounds like fintech just because you you have an unfair Advantage there because you can point to credibility and I would think about how I can do like a cold DM campaign I'd make a list of like the hundred Founders Chief product officers you're you know who that is and cold DM you'd be surprised how many people have open DMS on Twitter yeah and what the mistake a lot of people make is I get a bunch of coold DMS all the time is they just like write a a paragraph of text and and what I would do if I were you is and you're a great speaker what I would do if I were you would be I would just record a loom probably like a n 60 to 90 second Loom and just be like hey uh this is what I'm building here's why I think it's important actually forget here's why I think it's important speak to them uh here's the opportunity here's where I think it can bring value to you I'm looking for um like make them feel special like I've always been I've always loved your product and I'd love to figure out a way to bring you in would you be open to something small non-committal 10 you know 15 minute compation this is one of the things I was thinking about is like for example the company I work at now in the UK uh we basically bring people in and these are like CFOs mostly because our our product is geared towards CFOs and kind of managing company finances and we bring them in and we say oh like do you want to become part of our customer Advisory Board and a lot of them aren't even customers but the thing is because we're so close and we've got that feedback loop we invite them to dinners each week things like that we show them the things we're working on and the product has developed so quickly and is like so Niche it's ridiculous you know so I I do kind of like that idea as well and I like the idea of a cold DM campaign and also leveraging our credibility as two Engineers who have worked in fin for a long time so yeah no certainly and then also consider and maybe of this community honestly is finding finding a partner who is going to do the who's the Cody Schneider basically like having someone who's who's gonna just focus on go to market completely so that you guys can be focused on the product because it's very difficult to just do it all at the same time it is yeah it takes a lot of uh stretching both ways and yeah it's uh it's draining for me but yeah at least I'll give it I'll give it a good shot well thank you for coming up Ryan and we appreciate it um and uh yeah see you see you later take care man take care all right next hope I'm not pronouncing your name wrong Micah bringing Micah to the stage um also people who've sent DMS on Instagram I we we've got a few people in the queue and then I'll continue bringing them to stage I've got 116 people here at 150 I'm going to drink this non-alcoholic beer and at 200 I'm going to drink this can of Clamato juice um I said originally I think 250 but you know I'll do it you know so share this on Twitter share this on LinkedIn tell everyone you can and I'll drink a can of Cato juice all right Micah welcome to the stage yeah thank thanks a bunch this is super cool so I'm excited what do you got for us well so I'm a software engineer but it's fun to think of things outside of software and a lot of a lot of podcasts like yourself you know just business ideas or business podcast in general there seems to just be this trend of uh like doing hard things uh and so like a lot of folks who have kind of like quote unquote made it seem to want to go do these hard things and so I was thinking about maybe like a travel agency where you and your group of colleagues or like other entrepreneurs would have like a predefined hard thing that like this travel agency would have done for you and it would all be like taken care of for you um just in terms of like so you don't even have to think about like what that's going to be the logistics none of that and You' get out of it what you'd want to in terms of like building your relationships um while doing some sort of activity as an example something like um doing like an interesting or a cool 14er out in Colorado um but there can be like quite a few Logistics around that and like that would all just be like super easy done for you things that kind of thing so basically a travel agency but the niche is doing hard things around like a group of co- of entrepreneurs or Founders who are you know maybe a group of like four to eight something like that you know yeah we had a similar idea last time and I think there's demand for it what would the business model be that was something that was kind of where I was looking to get some thoughts around because I wasn't sure how I would approach that initially yeah well what are your options let's start with that yeah so initially what I was thinking is just to understand demand is I was actually just going to create a couple different options so I was just going to create like three different uh plans try and get it send it out to you know a 100 different cold DMS and just kind of see what kind of response I get and I would probably almost just look to you would purchase a plan and then I would just like modify it however like would suit that group's needs um for example like where are you guys going to stay like what kind of A or B andb like I wouldn't know exactly what that might be to start with for example so I was almost thinking like you would just charge for the just like a flat rate almost um for that I wouldn't want to do it in a PDF maybe something a little bit more slick obviously um but I don't that would be one option um I guess I haven't thought through all my options so here you know travel agencies have existed for forever yeah and I think with the internet they just became obsolete in a lot of ways because all the information basically the reason why travel agencies were popular in the beginning is because you didn't have access to the information so you'd go to a travel agency and they would book things for you um and but now with the internet you just use Google or now perplexity or whatever so and I I but I still think that there's like where is our opportunity in the travel space I think it's in the C ation of groups so it's like I'm going to bring together a group of people who are like-minded and people will pay like I was invited to um a trip in the mountains and I actually can't believe how expensive it is it's $6,000 for two nights and yeah it's too expensive um but the point is like it's you know it's such a crazy like the itinerary is so crazy and you know and the people like the landing page has like here you know I don't want to name names but it's like every you know all the Who's Who and tech and and like the Twitter Tech world are going and it's like maybe I should go you know um I think that there's here's where there's opportunity in the travel space it's in curating those groups and I think you can make margin on that and then I also think that and here's where I would take this idea if I were you I would actually create there doesn't exist the travel agency for Founders like I think the the the meaning I think um there's enough Founders who identify as Founders who would say I would pay money to someone to book me stuff who understand Founders and just make it easy and connect me with other Founders you know like let's say I'm going to you know Iceland it it'll connect me to the Iceland you know startup Community or something like that I think that there's just an the reason I like that is like you just create a landing page the travel agency for Founders you you can still do what you want to do which is created groups but you I think the lead is you say hey we're the travel agency you can book with us Load Ticket like you don't make your money on like booking things and connecting them but I think where you really make their money is on these like more expensive curated group tra travel but it would be it would be my it would be that travel agency's job then to curate the people who are going to be in that group right corre exactly that's kind of the opposite of what I had originally thought where like for example I would cold dmu and then you would be like oh me and you know you might have a list of like four or five friends who you immediately think of with so that's not what you're saying no no no exactly and you know Zach puts in the chat like as a cheap man's Hampton you know right in a lot of ways that's what it is um I think I love Hampton and I think it's you know I'm not a member but I from what I hear it's incredible experience but for some people they can't afford it and but they would rather put that money to going on the trip and connect you know connecting with other entrepreneurs along that trip so um imagine spending your Iceland vacation at an Icelandic startup conference and I think it's not that I think it's more like um Airbnb experience but like there's Founders there you know um and the truth is the founders in Iceland I'm sure would want to connect with other Founders um there's something there and I do like that you can just put paid ads I just think that there's something catchy and hookie about the travel agency for Founders and maybe like the name is like the founders travel agency.com I don't know if that's taken but we're getting a lot of sips so people are are really liking the the vibe we're getting you know JP says sip sip sip he's you're getting three sip so you know uh there's something there and uh yeah maybe you'll come back on in a future um a future startup idea is brainstorm just to see where where the idea has evolved so coner for Founders yeah that's interesting coner for Founders well travel uh Founders travel agency is available wow it's a l that's crazy how much do they want for it 1028 like $10 128 wow well be careful with this crew because you know this is the type of crew that will grab that domain so grab it before it's too late and uh and uh enjoy all right M thank you so much for coming on and we uh I'm gonna take a quick look at my Instagram and uh for those of you who um who uh who are asking how do you get up on here you just have to DM me on Instagram and I'm GNA send you a link so boom all right Mah by the way Mike butchering your name gonna send you no no that's that's it Micah cool awesome later y bye there we go all right hope you're not driving ellias hey how are you great I'm good dude I never knew you could I mean that makes so much sense like to put your airpod as the microphone like that I like you already that's great what's on your mind yeah so basically right now I'm working on this software called social poster which is a social media schedule in targeting UDC creators and my partner is working on this agency called uh get Jelly which basically helps creators monetize through brand sponsorships and I just feel like the whole Creator economy needs a way of actually monetizing so to be able to do that through artists you need to like basically Market their songs on social media would be a cool idea okay so how would you know how would you get that like how do you take this from idea to actually making it a reality how would you actually get customers and yeah so my partner already has like uh a big audience of content creators and through called emails to artist I guess that I probably would be interested interested in this type of service as it would be quite easy to actually make money through their songs because social media like open so many opportunities in the music space so if you could basically as a artist uh host competitions just like um 99 designs for example and they're like the most viral videos using your song as an artist would basically get awarded i' and I've already seen examples of people doing this not with artists but with like normal Brands basically right okay and what what do you what part of this idea do you want feedback on and I also want to hear from the chat what do you think of this idea is this a is this a sip or spit type of idea uh I'm sorry I gotta put you on the spot but is it you know is it a sip or spit idea and and what what part what part would you like some feedback on so I like feedback on how to actually monetize this idea and how to also get it to the market how to how to Market and how to monetize it not going to lie I haven't really thought too much of this idea it just like quickly came to me and I would like to share it with your audience yeah I think uh working in the music space is if you if you're going to work in the music space I'm just laughing we're getting some I'm still swishing spit spit need more detail details sip um you got a sip from Paulo um so first of all thank you for coming up and sharing this idea with us um working in the music space Ryan Hoover actually had a great tweet uh today I don't know if you saw it I'm gonna pull it up Ryan Hoover the founder of product hunt think he tweeted I know it's a tarpit idea but I'm surprised there's no music Central so social experience online at any meaningful scale and I know this is not what you're doing but there's so many the graveyard of Music startups or startups that cater to the music space is so big and the reason it's so big is it's very difficult to break into and they don't have big budgets and stuff like that I don't think this is a bad idea but I do think it's an idea I I would say give yourself the stress and think about what's an idea unless unless you're like super passionate about the people in the space and and that and and your goals to learn great but just know that you're in for a years of pain um and you might not want that or you might not want or you might want it so not an idea for me I got to say it's a and yeah you got to be highly connected for this one too so for for those Reasons I'm a spit um but I like the energy and let's see where you take it thanks for thanks for coming up and sharing with us and thank you for the uh the airpods tip yeah how grateful man all right take care goodbye boom sometime you know it's it's it's tough right it's tough to tough to deliver a spit but sometimes you just you know you got something in your throat and you you gota you got to take it out all right uh will you're on Deck but Ricky I'm bringing you up boom hi thanks for uh taking the time to talk whoa we like we have a podcaster or basically here yeah it's an irregularly uh irregularly published podcast but that was the original purpose of the mic acquisition there you go so I want to get your feedback I am a a tax strategy consultant so solopreneur you know just me um and I sort of have a niche within a niche which I know you're you're a fan of but um has sort of presented some problems for me and so I I'd love to get your feedback on that basically my main focus is on opportunity zones so if you've heard of that you might have heard of it for real estate there's not a lot of people who do that for operating businesses but you you can so you can set up a company and if you satisfy you know certain conditions and your company is of a certain type you can basically set it up in an opportunity Zone and then when you sell it you don't have to pay any capital gains stxs um there's obviously some caveat about that you know various rules about you have to put in some capital gains initially and you have to hold it for a certain amount of time Etc um and so like a couple years ago I wrote an article that went viral on Hacker News and that was sort of my initial launch gave me some some initial customers but my issue has been sort of twofold one is um bu the business model itself so I've basically just been doing like hourly Consulting on it and you know the uh one of the main reasons is like figuring out how to exactly package the service has been problematic so you know I might like I had this one guy who came and it was like the the wealth manager who had a billionaire client to had just sold a company for eight figures and you know was like Hey we're we're interested in this thing but like how how exactly does this work and so like talking through with them basically they didn't want to or the entrepreneur didn't want to start another company he just wanted to take advantage of the the tax strategy but there's not really anybody who starts opportunity Zone businesses so like unfortunately like for me the main way that I can help someone is like I can help them start their own business like if an entrepreneur sold a company and they want to pull an Elon Musk and like take all the proceeds and roll it into the next business that works great but if they want to just passively invest into an opportunity Zone business I basically can't help them because nobody knows about opportuni own businesses before they start a company so there's just not really many that are out there apart from like you can find you know a restaurant or like some some brick and mortar business that already exists in an opportunity Zone but there's not really any interesting businesses that are in Opportunity zones that are operating businesses um and so I guess one you know so problem number one has been there's sort of like a demand for if if I don't want to start a company I just want to invest what do I do you know and I I don't have any businesses to that I can go help them find you know basically like I I could try to start like a private Equity Fund right but then that's a whole like Pipeline and I I sort of went down that rabbit hole a little bit but um so anyway that was sort of like one option it's like maybe that's the better way to meet demand is to like create a fund that goes and like seeks out these businesses rare and far between and then brings those to wealthier clients the second option was okay maybe I go lower market and you know you don't have to have a bunch of money like basically the opportunities are rules like you could have you know $1,000 of Robin Hood gains and invest that into an opportunity Zone business you know a new new business that you start and then when you sell it in 10 years for you know $50 million it's all taxfree so that's the other option the problem there is my customer acquisition strategy doesn't really work because nobody knows about opportunity zones before like I gotta stop you I gotta stop you I gotta stop you because okay the people this is this is a add group of people you know the startup idea is junky am I am I right you know this is like a but I will say that there is something in Opportunity zone so let's talk about it so I think well my my question to you real quick is who who's building anything in the opportunity Zone space uh like are there any marketplaces adk there is there's there's one called opportunity Zone DB which is like a an online Marketplace they're basically like 506c funds will go to there to advertise so it's larger funds um pretty much entirely real estate there was a yeah that's the main marketplace I would say it's it's a niche within asset manag management industry okay let me share my screen so we can pull this up uh you're is this is this what I'm you see my screen yep first of all this is what I'm this is what I'm dealing with you know look at this I can't even access it right so this is like this is some old school stuff right and where where where's like the list like who's building the um like the yield Street of opportunity zones this is pretty much the closest thing um like it's it's not a huge industry there's not a ton part of it is because it it's like time limited right so like there's there was an earlier version of opportunity zones called Enterprise zones yeah and then that law phased out and then opportunity zones were a different version of that that came about and then it's probable that you know there'll be an extension of the existing law that has some tweaks in it there's been a lot of proposals but as of right now it expires basically the end of 2026 so because of that it hasn't really opportunity zones expire at the end of 2026 you have to be into them by 2026 basically or rather you have to have the capital gain so then you can hold it until 2047 but you have to be you have to have a capital gain that you invest into an opportunity Zone by the end of 2026 Okay cool so simple simple idea I think is you become Ricky becomes the opportunity Zone guy like you you get the handles on Twitter opportunity Zone guy you talk about opportunity zones um and you create a newsletter that is like you C curate the deals like this is a newsletter based business like uh I'm on a newsletter called um SMB Hunter which is Helen Gua she basically like curates here's like businesses that you can buy and you know you can learn about you know not everyone's buying those businesses they're just kind of there to like learn like yeah I'm interested in I'm one of those people that am interested in opport Opportunity zones I've looked at Opportunity zones but I'm just like it's too much work basically to for me to like think about it and so I think that if you can become were you were you looking at it for real estate or for businesses like operating businesses both I looked at it uh for real estate and I also looked at okay let me set up a business um in this part of the world and um I looked at like apartment buildings and then I also looked at um setting up like you know could I set up like a late checkout subdivision company in this part of Georgia for example and what would that look like you can do that part of Miami you know there's they're all over the place well you I'd love to learn more about that um and that that's you know if I could I probably should and and so you know um I just I don't you know I don't have the people in my network so that's why I think that the education piece within the like no one's doing this so you can own that territory make it media first I want want one one feedback I would like from you so I I have attempted to do this a little little bit my main issue has been the people that you know opportunity zones are inherently it's content about capital gains yeah and so like you're sort of the ideal person to make use of opportunity zones because you're starting multiple businesses but aside from people who are like they've already had some success they're sort of a serial entrepreneur maybe they have a couple businesses now like that's the sort of The Sweet Spot but if you are like you've had really successful exit and then you don't necessarily want to start another company then again I have the problem of like well they don't necessarily want to like create another company so they would have to buy into something or they're too early right and they're somebody who's they just never started a company their capital gains are not really on their radar so I could write all kinds of content about capital gains but it's not going to attract them because they're just you know it's not where they're at they're not thinking about that you know even the people who typically sell a company they'll come to me like five months you know into their sixth month period of time that they have have to reinvest and then they're like oh wait this is an option let me like see if I can do something now but well you're not really an opportunity Zone guy you end up becoming like I'm the tax savings guy and I'm like the creative tax savings guy and maybe like maybe that's a better way to frame it like maybe you're just I I figure out how you can pay less taxes and I do it through opportunity zones I do it through this I do it through that um would you stay on the high end of the market though or would you go lower because I think that tax rate still peels more to people who are you know they have enough money to care about taxes versus the earlier on starting a business I would and they have any inome I would cater to the high end and then a lot of people would be like oh well there's only like a thousand of those people or 5,000 or eight you know it doesn't matter like you know I've seen email lists that are a thousand people make millions of dollars a year it's just the you know if it's high quality it's it's high quality so um that's my advice to you um can we get a sip or spit on on Ricky can we get some sips or and spits put it post in the chat if you like this if you're new here we do sip if we like the idea and we spit if we do not like the idea it's not it's not it's not nice of us but we do it and uh and you're okay we got a spit and by the way the people who are saying he was long- winded he's he's he's jamming he's trying to get it out right he's we're learning so so it's it's okay uh it's okay we're getting some spits but oh a sip we're getting the spit sip um I think there you're getting a lot of spits I'm gonna give you a sip I think that there's something here you just have to put it together and i' start with an audience and just do breakdowns um I might be too smooth brain for this one that's a good one um the feedback yeah this is great feedback um and appreciate you coming up here your time to bounce we're going to bring up um will then we're gonna bring up Zach and then we're gonna bring up Mr sha power so thank you for your patience um we're doing we're doing the best we can all right and can you welcome to the stage Mr will lensen Jr what's up man how's it going thanks for having me good what do you what's going on what uh yeah so about so here's the deal so I've been most of my like professional life has been as a product designer I've worked with household names and startups and my own startups and whatnot but kind of this parallel life that has Happ been going on in my world since a kid is I've basically been a writer director World Builder all those sortes of things basically deep in story so over the last year so I've been thinking a lot about like how how do I merge these two lives of mine into one and you know with a background in design and brand strategy product strategy things of that nature I've been thinking a lot about how the structure of Storytelling very much applies to how you build a strong both brand and product and then specifically there is a um a story structure that is really simple and Powerful from Dan Haron the guy who created Rick Morty sorry I got to stop I I got to stop you just because I I just got a $5 Canadian hey there's your coffee exactly there's my coffee and thank you Sean power for that all right on come back in yeah yeah all good so basically there's this story structure called Story Circle it's super easy it's eight steps and earlier this year I outlined how that could apply to how you think about building a brand and a product and so um like software um and so so basically my idea is very simply this create a create that structure build a community around people who want to you know build a better and stronger narrative around their businesses and help teach that um I also think that there's a a potential way to use this and turn this into a research Tool uh in terms of a SAS product as well um because I think obviously with AI the jobs to be done area of life is going to be you know pretty common place but teaching those who can pull out out nuance and pull out um specifics and taste and perspective and imbue that into their business Andor product experience is going to give their businesses the Competitive Edge and so that's very simply what's been on my mind I actually was writing this all out this morning so this is a good time good timing that you were doing this and so curious um what your take is on that so and and and when you say community you know obviously a paid Community how how you thinking about business model and yeah so so I'm thinking that there's there could be a couple different tiers so to speak um first is of course having content that helps people understand but in terms of the paid Community um there could be a paid Community where there's a monthly webinar there's the course and then you know a community of business Builders to kind of jam and whatnot I obviously I could be in there as well giving insights and stuff like that um and then that's a paid community and then I I do think that there's some something interesting about how can we take what we now think of as you know customer research and where are they coming from and so forth and actually extrapolate that even deeper into kind of some assumptions about your your customers based on their traffic patterns and what that how how to translate that into um specific learning points that could that could be applied into what the story is that you're telling for your business um whether that be the marketing or how you incorporate that into specific product strategy and that's the thing that I think is interesting to here from me you know going back to your point about you know uh sales strategy there could be a whole course just on branding and brand positioning and brand storytelling but there could also be a course on how do you you know incorporate these learnings and this perspective that you have as a business owner um and business Builder into specific beats within your digital product as well um and that's something that as a product designer I've been doing for almost 20 years is that spec you know viewing you know holistic Human Experience into digital software and so I think that's part of the competitive Advantage I have here and do you have a name for this not yet I I keep uh I have a very clunky name for it which is like the brand and product Story Circle um but it's um no short answer not yet so I think your thesis is right I think that in an AI World taste and story helps is is going to be more and more demanded by Brands and it's it's that's not a crazy leap you know I think that they'll that pitch will really resonate with people and I don't know I can't think off the top of my head and we own agencies I can't think off top of my head of what are the different communities and agencies in that space so I do think that there's new territory there so I like the idea um I do think that what's maybe Miss in from the idea is just branding it a certain way and owning the word you know the example I use often is you know one of the reasons we built a couple agencies um one was called and and communities as well uh one was called uh boring marketing.com and and I think one of the reasons why it works besides the product is amazing and it works is that um the idea of boring marketing boring ways to grow your business kind of caught it went viral so my only prompt to you is what is your version of that how can you how can you tell that story in a way that like what's one term that you can own is is basically what's missing the idea around a community and how you monetize it and that to me is like yes it's going to work um but you do wanna you know yeah brand wrap it around yeah exactly and it would make sense especially given what you're building so um thank you for the idea I like it I I sip the idea but I I spit the name yeah the No Name definitely exactly yeah awesome thanks cool thank you for for yeah yeah have a great day you too all right thank you for waiting Zach and then Sean you are next boom what's up Greg longtime follower and listener love the Rebrand of the podcast too so uh are you Canadian I'm not no Washington State close okay and I could sense I could sense somewhere near the Canadian border some like salt of the earth Midwest oric Northwest or Canadian so no I went I went to school about 20 miles South of the Border though okay there we go anyways and I was I whatever I'm hearing I'm liking already so what do you got for us today all right man so I've worked in local government for the past decade and uh have just grinded through kind of the the career promotion ladder and had this idea of a community for Parks and Recreation professionals so um I built this website and launched it in January um stting to add features here and there and to give people a little bit of background in the local government or gov Tech space uh these Legacy kind of trade associations kind of run the the gamut and so there's National Parks and Recreation associations as well as state associations sorry what's the website I'm gonna pull it up it's uh parks and recipes.com okay cool and so um these Legacy associations uh charge departments or local governments um you know anywhere from $700 to $3,000 a year to become members or to receive access and they get discounts on national conferences Etc what I did was um no one is really building a community for the Professionals in the day-to-day yeah and so what I wanted to do was create content and have that like fun voice like we're in parks and W like we're you know in charge of the pickle ball courts right but then also give tactical advice on documents because each uh community has a recipe right and it's play on words because we earn parks and rack and recipes and each recipe you can learn from that and and do it a little bit better in your own community so uh that's kind of the pitch would love to hear what you think dude I'm obsessed with this this is the biggest sip of the day this is so good I like this on I mean I like this is you're speaking to my soul right here which is you found a niche um you're speaking to them um it's not for everyone I love like the playful branding it's beautiful I think the idea of like recipes I mean I I love I love that you're calling it recipes I just I hope I you know as long as it can you know for me I look at that I'm like what are you talking about I don't know if other people are like that so my only question is like should it actually be called recipes up top like would it convert better if it you know what called you know guides or whatever um and then you you know talk about how it's a recipe maybe I don't know um but again I'm not in parks and R so they might understand it better than me I think the job board like this idea of a job board for parks and Rex in itself is like a decent sized business um you know there's like uh so many examples of job boards uh that have done well and they're great businesses the question you know if I were you I'd be thinking about how do I like SEO ify um we've actually boring marketing.com has worked with a lot of job boards and uh there there's ways to create content to to bring people here basically um how do you monetize the JW board now so I don't um I just launched it literally last week oh and so um but what what I would do is if you click that learn more and maybe it's uh need a better call to action but if you learn more then people can go down and they get what they're you know there's two op standard and sponsored yeah yeah I mean there's a whole cold DM campaign around here too yeah um so I think you know I I do think that the the job board piece is going to be a good Revenue driver and yeah I like what you're doing this is dope um could also see like a p you know a paid Community um just for this function you know I don't know if you've thought of doing like a paid membership have you thought about that yeah I have and so you know one of my biggest you know core products is the Weekly Newsletter and so uh again to give some background you know the local government space is not Innovative and by by any means right and so all these State associations and Legacy associations trade organizations are sending just the most ridiculous content to folks every week and it's like hey donate you know $79 to the fund so that we can get you more parks and whatnot and no one's actually providing um tactical practical you know practical guidance on the stuff that we do on a day-to-day basis and so um yeah so uh a paid membership through beehive or a paid membership through memberships through a department is something that I have thought about before cool yeah I mean I like school using School generally uh for about 70% of whoa did someone just send me whoa I don't even know what currency this is but uh this is crazy Jones hold on I'm stopping here this is my first time like what currency is that even like I want to like I don't even know someone tell me what currency that is like does anyone know am I am I ignorant on this like is it a Russian Rubble oh Brazilian a real a real thank you Jones $ five I appreciate I don't I you know well I appreciate appreciate it that's very cool um and I learned something and I hope others did too um I use school for SK for about 70% of our paid memberships WhatsApp also is getting more and more interesting to us um as a as a just like a private WhatsApp because it's I mean it depends you know where your consumer lives um but a lot of people especially International are using Whatsapp but even the US it's starting to get more and more popular um and uh but I love this idea and um yeah I would just think th those are my quick thoughts you know paid membership um this is this is great everyone should look at this and this is the model for for how to build something so thank you so much and good work major sip to you and I'm inspired just by hearing that story so thank you appreciate it Greg thanks yeah oh Millie Millie's in the house up Millie all right now um we are going to remove Zach and we are going to bring up Mr sha power um who is someone I know who's a friend um so cool to bring this is will be uh besides from Jordan who's a business partner with me this will be my first friend bringing up on the stage so let's do it boom Greg Eisenberg wow and amazing this is so how random is this live stream it's great I just saw it pop on my feet I had a an hour was perfect Zach Zach was great Zach was great I was like have his website open I like dm'd already a friend I'm like yo check this out yeah yeah he was uh he was impressive I want to thank you for for the five dollars I appreciate that got you Greg yeah I appreciate that and uh what do you want to talk about today um it's an idea about my startup as opposed to a startup idea cool I like that um let's talk really briefly if you're okay with this about what it is that we do I would love that there's like um this narrative in AI right like these CEOs of large AI companies that are like you know we're going to take whatever we're going to put it in a meat grinder out of the meat grinder we're going to get cool generative AI things and the meat grinder it's like a black box it's magic what happens inside is Magic right and I want to consider two kind of futures um futes it's not binary but I think there I think there's going to be a two sets of Futures that are diverging on one side all the stuff that you're putting side of AI you can just take music um art uh copyrighted content books photography images if you can find it on the internet put it inside your AI algorithm awesome you get cool stuff on the outside or make it such that the content needs to be recognized in some way MH in future number one um my startup will not exist and I will have a lot of things to say publicly in future number two uh if you follow kind of like logic then attribution of AI inputs must exist it's impossible for it not to we world's first AI attribution system and we've patented it damn that's what we do damn that That's Heavy That's Heavy I mean I I I love that you're doing this and I think it makes complete sense does it just curious like does it how do you sleep at night you know because you're in a you're in a a ring with big players I've I've never you've you've seen me we've we've got we've gone up together yeah right and we've both had front row seats at some amazing startups um I've never ever ever been in a business operating at this speed with the amount and the kinds of people that I and our team are talking to on a regular basis yeah that's really cool I mean that's really really cool because you're feeling like you're I mean I'm sure you're learning like crazy right yeah and and you're like if this works this is like it's a it's this is a unicorn this will change an entire vertical potentially the path of humanity in a small small small way and it's not for us it's for the artists the creators the people who are amazing amaz like who are creating amazing human content your stuff like your podcasts right like all of the amazing things that you've put into your newsletters that people can learn it's about your recognition yeah well I hope it I hope it works and I hope that like who do you compete against I guess I think like right now we're competing against uh massive yeah companies whose business it is to try and monetize their AI without you know as much as possible without needing to kind of do things that look like royalties recognitions that kind of think yeah that's what I would imagine too and I think as you know as a consumer I don't want the platforms and the large companies to own everything you know I think it's important that there's startups that and ideas that come up from you know Mom and Pop basically I you know teams um or small teams that um you know could potentially turn into big companies but I I love the fact that you're you're in the arena I will say I'm scared of the Arena you know but that's a personal that's just personal choice um but uh it's cool that you're first of all thank you for sharing this because I think a lot of people here are they're torn between should I build a startup idea that's just kind of like a cash flowing type thing or do I go and change you know change the world World basically and what's cool is that you've come here and you've you've shared that I mean how big's your team now like you know what where you at I guess in the business and um it sounds like you've grown since last I I spoke to you um Greg this is actually one of the first times that I've talked about our startup publicly wow um and you know of course we better to do that than with you right impr promp to yeah it's like certainly one of the only times it is I think the first time that I've ever do this with an audience that I don't know that I can't qualify we can I pull it up can I what's the website of course we are musical. so the inputs are from rights holders right and we just decided to go after music rights holders first yeah damn first of all I love the manifesto as like I feel like every everyone should put a manifest though like what you believe in doesn't matter it has it has holy I can't tell you the amount of like huge like Huges in like they're very well-known industry Executives whove told me that they read the manifesto and it really resonated with them it has worked wonders for us yeah my only small piece of feedback is I would actually put here like share the manifesto call to action great idea it's really good um it was called oh yeah it was called something else before tell me about the name change obvious I'm curious we just wanted uh so first of all people thought that we were selier startup um it actually stood for sounds of machines making sound and we just wanted kind of a fresh start as we I think like you know one of the one of the wild wildest parts of this ride is that it's the largest Enterprise rights holders in the world who act who asked us to build this yeah and for a whole bunch of of reasons this unlocks a huge amount of revenue for them it's you know important and all of that stuff um but beyond that like we were really led by the market as a result of technology that we created and we wanted to fresh start with that how did you recruit your team because oh man it was it was a whole ride it took yeah it took a it took like it took time like I curated it in the same way that um you curate so many of your guests on your awesome podcast right I was really intentional about who I wanted and I approached them and I did kind of a I did A Hard Sell I went to my network I asked my network do you know anybody who's in a space that understands music and you know has a PHD in a generative space I wanted a music executive and it actually turns out that we get along so so well and what advice do you have for people who have an idea but are looking to recruit team members to to do their idea with yeah I think I think like a a thing that people forget especially in Canada is that there's this kind of like group of people that we think about that we think that we could just never get access to or we could never convince to do this and that's where I want to go first cool I go to the like you know the people who are famous in their field famous in their domains and I have that conversation because I know how excited and already well entrenched they are in the business I appreciate that I used to use beatport every day and then I convinced the CEO um of beport who sold the company after being CEO for five years to join my team legendary well that's inspirational I appreciate you coming up here and I'm just gonna invite a couple more people before I have to head out I can't believe it's an hour and 25 minutes in you're doing great Greg love uh love all of this kind of content that you're creating so many people are benefiting from it I benefit from it regularly honestly I I'm loving just like this is so cool like you're coming up other people coming up we're talking ideas like it it it builds me up in terms of energy um but I was you know I was talking to someone else before this who uh he was like oh you're G to spend like an hour plus doing that like don't you have something better to do and I was like my God what better that's not yeah so lame Tim Forin get up I see you're in here Tim Forin is a really smart guy so um okay I just invited um a couple more people

just connect my mic all right we're gonna give you take we're gonna we'll bring you back on we're gonna bring Jonas on first Jonas you want a you want a bus or a train I am yeah I didn't expect you to actually uh send me the link so fast so I'm going to founder Inc right now on my way there oh Founders Inc and ASAP yes yes yes yes that's the that's the place um I love it yeah really nice I mean like uh the best place to be if you're trying to build something meaningful I'm going to jump out of the out of the bus so we can uh we can have a chat I was in Founders Inc in uh a few months ago in San Francisco and it was the best energy I've felt in a long time it was crazy nice nice nice yeah we're having a nice Barbecue on Sunday so uh you know it has all of it right hard working and the good times too so totally sweet um what's on your mind yeah man um you know thanks for uh thanks for uh inviting me really appreciate this and uh thanks for doing uh Community Empire I belong to that too um yeah it's it's cool stuff you're cooking um I'm trying to do some something cool as well I'm trying to do something that's meaningful and uh the idea behind uh our product scammer block is every single year in the US 228 billion dollar are being um are being scammed from older adults older adults being 60 60 plus and um for about 40% of those the the phone call is the first uh touch point right um and what we are building is basically a first line defense tool for older adults or actually anyone in the world to Pro protect themselves from spam and scam calls so uh the way it works is that we have an AI agent that uh works as your AI secretary right yeah um works as your AI secretary and it um it picks up the unknown incoming calls so you don't have to and what you do is then you receive a very brief message saying hey this is Jonah's calling that's the purpose of his call and uh he is um um yeah like he's probably legit guy right or uh if they if they find that this is like a more of a scam theme then it will um they will say uh don't call this person back call someone you trust uh y y um and then the cool thing also that we added is a secret phrase so a secret phrase is basically something that proactive uh families do between their uh their family members is that they create a secret phrase to to share when someone is calling and someone is in an emergency right so there was quite a few stories where um people were using someone else's voice to um to clone it using AI right you just need about like 10 15 seconds to have a pretty legit um sounding voice um yeah so so that's what we're working on and oh man to sell to older adults is so difficult I'm it's it's intense they are not the early adopters they're not the innovators you know what they need is someone from the TV that has been on there for 30 years uh marketing your product right that's that's what they that's what they're looking for so my main question is like what I'm trying to figure out now is um go to market strategy right so so our current approach is that we're looking into like the younger audience so like grandkids or the kids of the older adults and uh trying to on board them kind of Pro provide them value because you still get some but um yeah I'm kind of thinking if I should lose the idea of this uh older adult Market or uh should I kind of continue so I've got I've actually got experience in the older adult space and I can share some learning so one of our clients was one of one of the largest uh you know centers for uh older adults and so we were helping them with Innovation and I'll tell you a little bit about some of the learnings I had there one is older adults actually don't like to be sold to as older adults right so they don't see themselves as older adults for sure they see themselves as themselves right so we we checked we would would do uh AB testing to see with an image of someone who has gray hair versus someone who has brown hair which which would convert more and we we were like of course the gray hair is going to convert more right but in fact the brown hair converted more no for sure this is the this is the reason why we kind of rebranded just like three days ago or like four days ago uh we had the pink beige brown gray people on the website so now we went more like yeah yeah I I read the book it's called Uh staging not aging I don't remember the offer but uh they were exactly talking about is that older adults they are not you don't call them older adults right it's just like for you to kind of understand but it's usually a stage it's either like a learning or a Renaissance stage as they call it so right yeah so that's just one sort of thing that I I learned um the second thing is well this is for you specifically you're going to have your website which is really going to be focused on the parents of older adults sorry the children of older adults like that's the way I think about it is like you have your like the website's for the children of older adults and the goal of the website should just be like you know the copy should be like your parents might get screwed you know right you're going to lose your inheritance right exactly and and being fun and cheeky and creating a video about it like not a product video it's like like a fun video around it um I think that is something I would do that I think would work um I would also I you know I would be basically selling this to uh well ARP all the older adult centers as a part of value ad have have you spoken to a lot of those folks I'm uh I'm trying I'm trying to get access to them I bought a I bought a suit and I bought a ticket to Boomer Venture Summit in San Francisco next week so I'm I'm heading there and there's going to be a lot of folks that uh the goal is to talk to yeah I got I got I gotta stop you I I got a we got Cody Schneider in the house I can't even believe it the man the myth the legend I'm gonna just send you Cody the uh if you're if you're around I'm GNA send you the link um so think about that I'd also think about how do you get this integrated on phones like OEM style right yeah our initial idea was maybe landline but then we learned that we cannot forward the call back so it would be like an infinite Loop uh but there are there are ways we can add actually like some Hardware elements to that end and on the so on the on the on the smartphone side uh an app would be the best way but our solution currently runs no app download needed nothing it's just like native uh setting on iPhone silence aown incoming calls and then you um forward the calls to unkown incoming calls to an AI agent and it sends you a message it's a very native experience you know not a lot of people know this but for you know you could you can literally pay to be on phones you know that right um what do you mean so like you can you need an Android app but you can pay for installs like you can do a deal with Motorola so it's pre-installed on people's phones oh wow okay I didn't know that yeah so anyone still buy M Ras though well I mean people buy Android you know Samsung you know right right right there's these agencies that you can that manage everything for you you can check them they're like like Google it later like app install omem agencies um and and I think just having that as a value ad because like for motor Ola let's just say or Samsung like this is a huge um huge opportunity Cody says this is 100 a th% not even 100% this is a th% an ASO play for for install if app nice that's cool that's cool uh one last thing uh what we actually did uh yesterday we uh we cloned uh we cloned the voice of of of Ricky from Rick and Morty and uh we're going to use that for for the to answer the voicemail right so it's kind of like we're looking at this sort of a bit of like a kind of geny angle angle that we can uh that we can explore to uh because we saw like there's so many videos on Tik Tok and YouTube that people are actually fooling around with those scammers and spammers um would be quite fun you know to uh kind of have your like any character that you wish to uh um to answer your phone calls for you Donald Trump yeah with Cody like it needs to be social content and fear like that that's what I think too it's like if you just change your copy and positioning to be like your parents are getting scammed your parents are getting scammed someone lost a million dollars I think um and I think it is really focusing on on the children and maybe giving them free like do you do a free trial now uh no right now it's a 100 uh 30day no questions refund policy right so we want to test the conviction but we can refund like immediately basically so I mean you're on to something here I love the idea this is a huge sip SI for me I just think that the positioning and the go to market is where you can you know is the next step um for sure for sure yeah so thanks for the idea and keep keep us posted awesome thanks great yeah appreciate it all right take care Jin us send my regards to uh furcon and all right we'll do yeah yeah awesome yeah yeah all right we're gonna BR Pao back boom Pao hey Greg how's it going oh your buttery smooth now um all right so I'm not really gonna waste your time but pretty much I've got a fun little uh free to all idea so bit of background so pretty much I've got a small free community of like 500 agency owners um I just screw it from my personal brand and um my connections and I run an agency myself kind of similar to your company you probably need a robot um so basically implementing AI into other businesses specifically we work with like marketing agencies um and basically from running this agency I've been trying to pretty much like improve on my content and specifically on LinkedIn and I kind of the the analytics on LinkedIn I didn't really they're not they're not very very satisfying and I felt like there could be some some work done so I was just thinking um I've seen this done with LinkedIn with an with the Twitter sorry with an app called ugly duckling doapp I think uh and they pretty much just do a Chrome extension with Twitter analytics in with some nice UI and then they basically got some leaderboards okay hold on ugly duckling dot was it app app yeah okay who yeah so something really just like this but for free um I mean just to kind of just build uh build more more of an audience build more of like a some emails and and that kind of stuff some kind of Chrome extension probably um and then yeah some leaderboards so like a leaderboard for growth a leaderboard for consistency um and just to kind of keep people accountable and then also be able to actually you know see what content uh performs best and kind of analyze it I guess this is this is I never I've never seen this this is really cool but if you're making it free how do you monetize it I mean I I'm not I don't really need to make money right now I just I'm just trying to build assets like email lists and and audiances to later on because I'm I'm 16 like I've have my parents pay for you know I'm lucky enough to be in a household where I've got access to a computer and Wi-Fi so I'm just uh you know yeah well Cody Cody says won't want to build what's the offer done for you automation why do they want to be accountable I would say uh they want to be accountable so that they uh post consistently and um actually get traction from the LinkedIn and I guess get leads from the LinkedIn that was my that's why I want to stay accountable at least um from my own experience do we know how big ugly duckling is um they've got some hundreds of users I think I don't know how many are paid but it's just an IND app um I believe cool um yeah I mean first of all you're 16 you speak very eloquently you're doing cool things I'm impressed uh Cody's gonna find out how big it is just give him a second um and I just I need to give we need to just pump pump Pao up and give him a sip just because he's he's he's a legend you're a legend you can you can come up anytime you want to come up thank you Greg and um I think that I just I with this particular idea okay yeah that's exactly what I was going to say I was going to say have a feeling that the the market is small so I think about how can I like the idea that you're like okay what can I give away to get emails like that that concept to me is you know makes a lot of sense I'm just not sure that building this tool which will take up a lot of your time and energy is where I would be doing it so your goal is right your goal is right but what's what's something else that you can create that will be so I got this landing page and I got the domain called LinkedIn hunter. uh LinkedIn hunter.com the domain has nothing to do with it but I kind of noticed that when at least from my experience and I know I have this community so I can ask all the people but pretty much like leads lead generation still a big problem like even with you know apollo.io and all these big players like Zoom info people want like these personalized not personalized I guess very Niche databases so I've thought of making just a a database where people can get lifetime access this I'd probably give them like a you can see it on the website we got a free sample but probably like a lot bigger like a lot bigger free sample and then pretty much um then actually sell something like lifetime access to it and even with the updates um whereas other players are basically selling for export searches so like you can get access to 100K leads but you can only export like 2.5k it's kind of useless so instead you basically make it just lifetime access you get all the leads you want um and uh yeah we need to get you some I know you're you're at your parents and you don't need the money but the recurring Revenue it's not about the revenue it's about the value that you're providing so I think um and I love I you know I understand like the domain LinkedIn Hunter is dope um and I know tweet Hunter was acquired for like $10 million or something like that um I'm just I just don't know if that's the that's the product so that's my quick quick feedback on that uh for those of you who want me to drink the Clamato juice um it's now become warm so there's only one thing worse than the Bloody Caesar Cody you you you'd probably hate this it's a a Canadian Bloody Mary it's a bloody Mary with Clamato juice no one wants to drink that I said if 200 people join i' I drink it but you're right I think I do need to drink it for 16-year old Paulo but a warm one like I don't know give me a second I'm gonna go put this in the freezer we're gonna bring up Yash in the house and while I put this in the freezer um you guys could hash it out yes you're live dude you're live yeah I was just waiting for you I don't want to be rude and just start Shilling before you're here no before uh what do you think of this idea and and do you have feedback what would you do if you were paa oh paa I was gonna was gonna get you extra feedback there yeah I would agree with Cody that you don't want to initially build too much software because these types of tools and if you're building on top of Twitter API and stuff he's saying it's quite risky so I think super hard to build but Paulo is a legend and he said he has emails of 500 agency owners right so I I think he could and he has this community so he can monetize that in like so many ways like there's a huge productized service CRM kind of thing that people are have you seen many requests and all these kinds of stuff like everybody is racing to build the Ops side of stuff for for agencies right so I would look around in that space yeah yeah I mean I'm just I I just I I kept getting asked oh where where can we find lead gen tools where can we find leads and then I just I I gave them all the tools and they kept asking so clearly like it's not coming out for them or something something's wrong I don't know but um also just my experience like I feel like paying for something more Niche like Greg says you know niche of a niche might be more worth it for some of these people um especially with in like I guess I need I do need to work and find a way to monetize uh in a recurring way but yeah where you can basically not pay for searches or for exports but just pay for the leads that you use or something um along those lines no 100% And I just saw twet about how big zo Zoom info is right maybe the leads are not something that you differentiate it but people are building all sorts of AI tools on top of lead gen tools right yeah yeah yeah that's what I have to say have you have you seen Google my business leads like multiple years ago on when the internet was in its dark Forum era and we didn't have Twitter people used to build tools that could scrape like local businesses because local businesses are the best leads right so yeah maybe you could you could go super local with this and not with like I mean that's that's what I did when I when I was cold calling I would scrape Google Maps I just banged out like three hours of Cold cooling uh when I didn't have school um I booked some meetings that way you know and uh what ended up working with some of the biggest marketing agencies in the UK somehow just from cold cooling but I I think there's just so many now to scrape those local businesses like uh I think it might not be worth it anymore PA where can people you to follow you on Twitter and stuff put put in the chat um you can just check out uh my uh my YouTube which is just there I've got links to communities in the description or give us your Twitter too okay one sec the the God has has what up braced our presence got my sour on shirt on we're here what are you sipping chaos yeah I can't believe you're joining us I got 30 minutes so we're gonna rapid fire all right I'm not allowed to work on Saturday but I've been allotted 30 minutes I didn't know you were an observan Jew you know it's a little weird you do you do you do a little of everything little everything but um yo if you have a community of uh agency owners that are trying they're like asking you yo how you doing leads how you doing leads that's basically them begging you to do lead gen for them that's especially if you gave them all the tools and then they're not providing that back that's 100% what's happening so like if I was in your shoes I would offer some type of done for you service say hey this is going to be priced at 2500 a month starting six 60 days from now you can get access to it right now for ,000 a month right as an early beta user and then basically you just go and spin up like cold DMS and cold emails for them right and just come God at that understand how to use these tools and you know how like to access all these databases so if I like if I was in your shoes like that that is something that I think is the super easy path forward building the tool piece like I think once you have the cash flow from this then you can start looking at this tool component and this is typically how these agencies function a great example of this is the company lead bird so what they do is they're basically like a done for you cold email service right um they have all these agency clients but they've built this like massive data set that they've done cashed of all these basic like basically they've scraped tons of databases think Apollo you know snow any of these and then what they're doing is they're basically storing it and then they provide access to those databases with like one-time purchases and fees so basically you can go and use I think it's called like uh uh like list Builder or something I'll find the website it's like list list iio or something I can't remember the name we use it but basically you go and you you pay them I think it's it's insanely cheap it's like 50,000 emails for like1 50 bucks right now the emails aren't super like clean they're not like crazy validated um but just use a tool like zero bounce or you know any any of these email validation tools um and you could even build that as a service on top of it but anyway yeah I mean I if you have if you have people asking you how do you get leads and then you providing them all the steps to get that and then them not wanting to do it because it's like you know time that's needed if they're making Revenue like this is some you know this is an easy done for you service that's like your agency service versus other agencies um that's that's a massive cash flow opportunity especially at 16 man I wish I was doing stuff at like this I was I was doing like print on demand [ __ ] when I was your age so I tried that yeah no I mean there's cash in it honestly you can make a ton of money on that like on etsy.com just doing like especially with AI generated images um you find all the longtail keywords related to like shirts use a tool like everb or Crest to like find the top um uh like performing uh uh products that are for specific keyword phrase but again just another option I think it just depends on what your goal is like you're trying to get clout are you trying to get money there's there's different path forwards with this like if you're trying to get clout then the tool thing might be the path right but if you're trying to get money then you know you're sitting on I mean 500 people if you get 1% of those to convert right like just do that math right now like that's five people and they're paying you we'll say 1,500 a month like I mean at that point you're doing 700 7500 a month at 16 I mean you yeah put a Rolie on your wrist in 90 days right totally go and start flossing on all your classmates you really want I mean again it just depends on what you want with this and like money at 16 just comp by the time you're 36 that money is worth so much right like 100% you know 10 grand when you're 20 what that turns into when you're 30 is ridiculous right like if you can if you can get that cash flow to be happening at that you know at that young of an age so yeah no I did just want to say like cuz what I noticed is a lot of the agencies that I hop on Discovery calls with even though like I have a Dev team and we can really like you know build out these complex AI systems a lot of the time they just want help like with outbound and like having an Outreach system and um having like AI appointment sets and that kind of stuff and that's probably been my like my most common request so that's kind of something that I'm I'm thinking of just like doubling down on and then also using the community as a funnel I'm thinking of maybe making I don't want to take up too much time here but making a paid community on top of it as a low ticket offer and then also yeah having my agency as the high ticket offer um how I would think about this is layers right so you have top of funnel which is going to be probably like four you page content think Instagram reals YouTube shorts Tik Tok that leads into some type of community that's like free and then what you're trying to do is basically build own media with them so like some type of email newsletter whatever and then you're just basically and probably YouTube videos as well like you talking through yo here's how to do lead gen and then just like here's 15 minutes of you doing you know insane lead gen work but I'm GNA you know if I'm a a busy professional that's running an agency like I'm GNA watch that and there's either two camps I'm going to be in I'm GNA go and Implement that myself or I'm G to be like this is a massive time suck can I just hire this kid and then as you have an offer in front of them that's an easy upsell right like they just consumed hours of content with you talking about you know how to do this thing that they're trying to accomplish so you've already got trust in buying you've Illustrated that you're capable of this so it's layering those things together right it's it's it's I think it's that that's how again you can you can build out agencies just service companies right now at scale yeah yeah definitely going to double down on YouTube I've been doing it for a bit but uh got to be more consistent dude you yeah I mean I just po I I did a post like things I wish I knew in my 20s the other day and my my number three thing was be a YouTuber and I was just like post every day just figure out a way to post every day and you know about anything yeah about anything starting when you're 20 and by you're 30 you will have 100,000 Subs thousand and then that own media channel just turns into top of funnel right because like you have so much like I think the thing that people don't realize with like shorts and I see this all the time they're like yo I got uh you know 10 million views on shorts last month I'm like sick did you sell anything they're like no I didn't [ __ ] sell a single thing it's because nobody actually buys from shorts unless you're doing ugc and like you know something that's de like direct to Consumer where it's like an impulse purchase but if you're trying to do high ticket you have to basically use the shorts as a vehicle to get them into something where it's more long form think of it almost as like a vssl like a virtual sales letter where you're then you know it's a 40 minute video of you talking through some process that you've crafted or created you can show them step by step but again it's like the implementation of that it's 40 minutes for you it takes them 20 hours and they also have to have a team member that's managing it right so it's going to be cheaper for them to just hire you at whatever you know two grand a month mon to be to run that whole thing for them so yeah you're right you're right I mean I have run channels in the past like which have done pretty good but yeah I mean Tob kind of a different game it's more about the leads and not the you know the clout vanity metrics I guess it's more about you know the actual Revenue so yeah dude I I I I'm obsessed with you Paulo I'm quite obsessed with your Vibe I think you're going to do big things and and you're doing big things which is crazy and so uh thanks for coming up here and thanks for coming up again and uh I would pick the thing you want though that would be the last thing I'd leave you with is like you decide what you want like lifestyle wise like again like it can be for clout right like we've all done stuff like this where it's like y I'm just doing this just so I can have graphs that look ridiculous you know or whatever or build some type of thing that everybody knows about but you know a lot of the times like what ends up happening you're going to do that you're going to be like okay that was easy like now do I basically you know build some type of like you know Revenue generating thing or whatever because then that turns into this whole other game right and like as soon as you know you probably already made money on the internet so you already understand this but you're gonna make all this just compounds and levels up and then suddenly you look around you're like I don't know how the [ __ ] I got here but it's been 10 years of it right so yeah anyway you're gonna crush him man whatever you do I think it just it's just like deciding what you want and then building out the business or whatever it is behind that to like accomplish that you know whatever that goal is so yeah thanks a lot for the insights guys uh don't forget about us when you're big though yeah 100% can we can we screenshot this so that we can tweet it once Paulo becomes like a legend I mean he's he already is but like discovered on this totally Paulo get out of here get out get out of here you're just you're too good you're too good for us all right thank you Yash what's your idea yep yep so let's let's dive straight into it Greg I sent you three do do you want me to pick my favorite or can I go with I I want you to pick your your favorite yes okay let's go I think Cody will love this because he likes digital products and my idea is very simple you know how everyone is building AI YouTube thumbnails and there's this huge race but you know the biggest problem with AI YouTube thumbnail makers is they'll generate you a thumbnail but you can't use that you need to edit it you need to take that it's one flat file anyone who runs a YouTube channel even eventually needs like the work done but they want to put some sort of yeah they need a layer version no AI tool can generate this so my idea company sorry go ahead I won't cut in but I go ahead please sorry yeah so my big idea is like [ __ ] AI I I I own a very sick domain called thumbnail do Market I was like What if I hire kids in India to just make the temp like literally canva PSD figma templates by the way nobody is doing doing this and I can see smoke signals on Etsy right if you go to Etsy you'll find the shittiest templates there that that are making like 200 300 Grand a year and like whoever I tell this idea they're like why can't canva do this canva has YouTube templates but they're really shitty like no YouTuber would in their right Minds would use it right so my my idea is very simple build build a Marketplace of YouTube YouTube thumbnails andbody else has a yeah so I would make this a subscription offer a free pack right so it's going to be a pack of 10 to 20 that they get access to that gets their email and then I would upsell them if you're a YouTuber that's legit you're making videos constantly right so you want basically access to these layered like you know templates that you can use um ju sorry just to connect this to another idea so that I saw I just saw this company and it's basically like Clips but they're like their their whole thing is like Hey we're building these layered uh XML files that you can import into Premiere and then edit the clips basically that we provide you right because like what AI is we're seeing happen is like it's really good at getting 80% of the way there but that last 20% it's really shitty at right and that's where the human like the expert comes in but if we can do all the heavy lifting that 80% like then you know there's a value ad there there's some there's some you know some uh capture like Revenue capture that we can create but I this uh the the idea we talked about with Greg on his podcast the the the Cricut idea I would just take that same thing where it's like imagine you have a 100,000 different templates that they can download but there it's it's a monthly subscription or a yearly subscription that they get access to and then to your point you just like use Global talents to make these out at scale go find the best ones like Source them in and then build these layered files are they using like Photoshop or what's the tools they're using typically to build these out so I'll make it on figma and then we can give give it to them on can we'll give them every possible editable software that the work like that's popular what do you think of putting up so uh another thing that I want to do for free traffic is Mr Beast launched a version of this but my idea is like if you if if you're a YouTuber today and you want to see what are the top thumbnails in your re like Niche it's quite hard to do it on YouTube because you get all a lot of spam and you only see eight videos so I was thinking uh I found a script that can just scrape like millions of YouTube thumbnails that could be your Le your top of funnel right is like and then what I would do is cold email so you can scrape YouTubers emails right from their profiles on the about section you can go hire somebody on Fiverr you can probably scrape a 100,000 emails and cold email all of them it's like yo I've got this free thing for you it's this library signs them up right I mean at that point you could probably just put them into a drip nurture even and then like upsell them access to this thing um but I would just try to like there's some type of offer and then some type of subscription because I'm just thinking about the people I know that are in this space like they're constantly doing this right like it's like you know they and they all like everybody that I know that's like Pro this is like they have all of these templates that they've saved over time and then they're just reusing them over and over again like all you're saying is hey we're just we're just providing that as a service for you and it's like this it I mean really what this play is is probably um like you know what traditional stock photography was right so like look at the business model of a shutter stock where it's like hey you can pay for like 25 of these photos or 25 of these thumbnails and it's at a higher price point right say it's 50 bucks for the 25 or you can just get you know a yearly yeah exactly for whatever $1.99 a year or whatever that price that makes sense based off of the business model but I I mean I think is a brilliant idea I think it's now you know it's just figuring out how do I what's that off the hard part will be figuring out what's the offer to get them initially there once you have that then it's drip nurture you know up sell them into that subscription you want to you guys want to hear so I have like 60 emails I know that's not huge but the funny it's a very funny story on how I got it so there was a YouTubers conference that was happening in Dubai I was invited I I made this website literally in the flight it's it's a really shitty website I was thinking I should wear this website's uh logo on my t-shirt and then just Reach people there but I thought that's a shitty idea because that's selling so you know what I did I wore YouTube's uh t-shirt in that thumbnail so because it was a YouTubers conference everybody thought I worked at YouTube and they tried to pitch me and I was like I was like okay I don't work at YouTube but hey this is myidea and people actually gave me their emails like manually and I have like 60 OD emails for this stuff so amazing it's quite interesting you can just there to piggyback off that for anybody that's listening that's trying to do inperson events that's actually a way to get people so the the goal of inperson event should be trying to get people to go to your booth right so if you have a booth there you're trying to get foot traffic to happen so there's a couple things that you can do to make that happen you make an Instagram trap so like you know something where you print out a photo and they like you know it's like they actually like stand you know stand in front of one of those stupid signs that's like you know what like the the the neon signs right with the the green Walls um have it be like loud music blaring and people dancing Just Like get literally like just hire people and they're like whole thing is they're just GNA dance like the entire event and then what we ended up doing uh when we were at when I was at Rupa is we we had people like dressed up in some type of themed costume every time so like one year we did uh like like astronaut suits right and so then we'd have two pairs of two people walk in astronaut shoots suits around the venue and people would be like why are you dressed like that you know like what like so immediately like oh we're with this company here's like where here's the booth number go there so it creates inbound traffic as soon as a crowd is around that Booth you're going to get more people to naturally come it's just like the the the effect of it and then the other thing you can layer on is have some type of giveaway that's for their kid that's too big for them to carry inside of a backpack so think like a huge Teddy Bear right and so it has to hang out of their backpack and what you'll get is an inevit like inevitably people be like wait where'd you get that and it creates more foot traffic back to the booth so anyways that's how you can hack uh like inperson events yeah Greg One Last Thing Before I I know I've taken too much time already what I was saying was the another goto Market strategy was like you know how sometimes certain VCS write a state of AI or they'll write a state of certain industry I I think I I want to publish a report called state of YouTube thumbnail and just say that okay red color dominated in this Niche this font size or this stupid face or you know you know these patterns and just release this huge thumbnail report like once in every 3 months six months because then it can become like the industry of thing where yeah and people will just pick and even the newsletter can be uh you know another interesting thing I did was Chad GP is the new model is really good at giving basic feedback so so what I did was if you put a YouTube thumbnail in this it can give you couple of uh feedbacks on why this is good and why this is not so you can essentially run an automated email and ask people that hey give me your email I'll send you three or five ways to improve your YouTube right holy [ __ ] yep yep y but yeah I'm using a lot of chat GB nowadays to like do all these Audits and give it to people right I mean by the way so the report hack like report on industry hack yes use Ai and then paid ads to the report Nob brainer or C or Cody you know work with Cody on I think you could do targeted so you can Target people with a YouTube interest on Facebook Facebook ads so you could probably I mean I I I bet you could get under dollar like like conversions with something like that like with a like a YouTube ENT because like half the people that are on YouTube are like wantrepreneur like want like what the wantrepreneur for Creator is right it's like they want to create and so they're trying to figure this out and that's probably who you're going to be selling to because like the the pros they like they have access you know they have teams they have access to the best people in this um yeah I mean I think that report I mean I want that report and I'm sort of in this space right so I'm I'm I'm shooting both of you guys an email for sure all right perfect yeah yeah if you're Legend and by the way I gotta I was just checking your website I gotta I gotta show people this this is hold up okay this is this is what I'm this is what we're dealing with this guy over here this is this is your website check it out if you want more of Y this this homie obsessing over product strategies like Bank heists I like your Vibe yeah like your Vibe thank you so much for having me here and sorry I took up more time please I I would love to hear how this goes I think that like I just you know we're in the this in a similar tangental space to what you're in and like we know people that would want this type of thing um and I so I I feel like it's a no-brainer if you get it's just going to be figuring out that top of funnel which it sounds like you have three ideas I would test all three of those see which is the cheapest and then figuring out that price point of like you know is it 19 a month is it you know 199 a year what whatever that number is that uh that gets you Revenue I have a huge I have a really really big YouTuber who I'm going to run a demo with who I can essentially uh I mean I can it's not an end or anything have you guys seen T Talent recap videos on the internet right where it's just America's Got Talent right you know how all uh any Recaps right so this there a channel that has like two or three billion views and I think they have like 10 or 20 million subscribers I'm working with them and I I've worked with them before for like a lot of like Community stuff this and that so I just pitched them this and they they want to do a test of thumbnails and whatnot so I'm thinking of doing some sort of case study and showing them that hey our thumbnail conversion was so and so increased by blah blah blah and hence you know it could just run off bunch of these so I'm going to email like you know and the the way I got them to reply was I just sent them a PDF report and I was like hey uh that's the like I think anyone who's hearing this my only thing that I like to tell people is you should give more than you get and everyone will want to work with you and everyone will want to like do business with you right and but yeah thanks for listening to my TED Talk Cod and Greg I'll definitely send you guys emails about like all this stuff you guys have been too kind and generous with your time cool usst dude that Doe love to see it hell yeah all right we're gonna we're gonna throw some other people on here uh Scott what you got for us what is up guys what up Scott hey hey uh so kind of barnicle on the whale idea uh there's a new tool called RB Tob that de anonymizes website visitors um so it'll like 20ish percent of people that come onto a website and bounce it'll be able to figure out their name email LinkedIn profile job title all this stuff right uh so my idea is basically build an agent off the back of that um so you reach out to all of these B2B companies who would love to recover leads that are coming to their website um I've set this up both on my site and uh ran it with a couple like beta customers the issue that I ran into is they get a ton of traffic that just isn't actually an ICP fit um so my thought is effectively you set up this pixel on their behalf make it easy for them but then you're actually doing all the ICP filtering so only figuring out who are the actual people that they want to reach out to and then you set up uh basically like automatically triggered emails to go out to them just handle it all for them and just charge basically a fee for any recovered lead so it's almost like a cart abandonment service for B2B this is you're speaking Cody's language I I mean I'm geeking out over here just trying to not say anything um what's that company Greg is it retention. comom what's so RB Tob is like they had Ecom version and they're like holy [ __ ] we could just move this into B2B it's the exact same founder and everything totally uh so I think you could automate your entire backend with AI like is this lead qualified here's our ICP and so then it's just like I'm imagining it's just like every person that hits then it's just like running right um I mean this is easily a 15K 20K a month type service um I would go after anybody with huge sales Orcs that like they're just grinding and then deliver them these types of leads I I mean no-brainer super easy um the hard part will be getting in front of the decision maker if you have case studies that'll be the way to do it um so I I you know something like we we you know with the traffic that you already had we generated this many more leads like that's probably the angle that I would go from um yeah man I I I think this is a brilliant idea the only thing that I would be worried about is what's going to happen with privacy data privacy laws over long term so you probably have a window where it's like this is going to be a cash printer for the next two years or something and then you know boomers are going to realize that and really everybody is going to realize like yo I don't want people to know what I'm doing on the internet and so they're going to you know gdpr is gonna gonna uh move and we're already seeing this with ads right like why is everybody going back to traditional marketing practices is because ads the tracking isn't as robust as it was previously and so I think uh I I think that that would be my own the only downside I see of this type of thing but the nice thing uh so RB Tob already like filters out all the EU users so from an agency side I don't have to worry about that totally um two questions for you guys that I could use help with uh the first is just like how would you run lead gen for this would you just spin up cold DM and email campaigns or how would you get I guess like those first 10 customers um and then two my thought is you could like basically spin up like copy paste a bunch of different agencies and just be like we're the winback agency for it firms or for like literally just copy paste by niches and uh spin up 10 different Niche websites that all do the exact same thing your back end's all the same but uh be super specific with like the language that you're using on your website um thoughts on that I would I would nich down um I would look at like what are the top lead you know like sales-driven type of businesses like you know it's probably like real estate it's probably you know it's probably Insurance all these types of things um and then figuring out okay which one do you get the most traction with in the beginning do do you have any have you done this at all yet or is this just like you know super young idea where where you at kind of in that process yeah so I've literally had two beta customers um my so it's been interesting uh the amount of traffic that they get on their website is the sort of key thing right if they're not getting 1,500 to 2,000 visitors a month which isn't that much but like really smbs I thought was actually going to be the space to go after but they just don't get enough traffic to drive enough Le through to make it worth I feel like this is something for like a clavio or like you know company yeah I think it's probably going to be like ass um what I would do is go look raise their like anybody that raised an a be like yo like we can get you like you're already getting traction like we can get you we can extract more people out of this for you basically right and if they but it would probably the filter would be like do they have a sales org already like they're past founder Le sales but they don't have like the robustness of being like you know super far down the line I would get my first customers that way and then start climbing the ladder up into like more Enterprise deals Greg what's your thoughts I would actually go and penetrate the YC community so yeah that could work yeah not many people know this but YC has a private social network called Bookface and so many startups have actually like the only reason to go to YC today is to sell to other YC Founders 100% and uh there's so many examples like lad for example it's like multi-billion dollar company scaled by just selling initially on on Bookface and two other YC Founders so I think if I were you I would just do everything I can to get into the YC Network and create content for the YC Network I'd also I also think that organic video around your AI like anything AI that you've built around identifying uh like Cody was talking about on the back end some of these leads that the sort of stuff that you just see go viral on like Tech Twitter so organic video plus YC seems like good places to start totally agree love it yeah I think that you know you're probably gonna have to get them young to begin with and then you're gonna get like enough Rumblings in the industry that you'll just start to get inbound and then I would just have you know make some type of owned media channel right like literally just a podcast that's like lead genen you know B2B lead genen like just name it that is the show the B2B lead gen show and you just like interview people that are in that space yeah exactly and then distribute that out to sales like anybody with a director title hire and that's thousand this is a great company idea I you got a huge huge opportunity here but again I I would be uh I'd be worried about I only the only thing I'd be worried about is like what happens with um uh compliance like private dat data privacy I think there's a short yeah this is a cash cow for 12 24 months that's what I was laughing like revenue or retention or whatever that that company I can never remember the name um but uh for them it's like yeah they grew to like 20 million AR like 18 months and it's like okay cool but like I don't like personally the longevity of that business I just don't know based off of what we're seeing at a global scale as soon as a commonwealth country adopts one of these right like you see Oz or you see the UK like happen that it trickles into Canada it's gonna go into the US it's it's bound to happen so for sure uh can I ask one more question to you guys do you have a framework for cold DMs like how do you cut through the noise and seem like a normal human instead of just like pitching right off the bat people that you get a million of a day for me go ahead Greg yeah I was just gonna say um I mean I always include a loom video like 60 seconds or less and how do you prove that you're human like you are a human and what you can do is like in cold email like screenshot what the loom looks like with a big ass play button and and then put it in the email and then like link that um link that image yeah link the image um but I think you could be like hey similar web like this is probably the the structure the content structure like similar web is saying your website gets XYZ numbers like we typically see that with companies that are get this much traffic there's this many leads that we can extract you know from from their traffic like more lead than they're currently getting right right and I mean that's a that's a repeatable thing where it's like you could sit down for an hour Crush you know probably 10 of those out land those or just you know hand them off to a VA or something like that I mean probably what this turns out is you initially and then you have somebody that's like just that's all only shoot that off day yeah exactly just all day long you're basically building those out um I wouldn't use yeah I don't know I mean you can maybe use one of these like AI clones now I've seen these more and more like these avatars but I just feel like this is probably a high touch thing guess also at that price point again like if you're you're like yo it's 15 to 20 grand to do this like it's totally fine for you to do really manual stuff on that that that reach out especially to get that addition that once you get 10 customers to it'll just this thing will naturally compound as well like you will you know because all these business owners know each other they're going to be like yo we just increase revenues by 15% quarter over quarter and all we did was like hir this agency right and we paid them 30 grand like they're going to do that all day so love it thanks for your time guys later Scot all right I probably got one more in me Greg and then I gotta bounce all right sahill you're the you're the last last one to be blessed by Mr Cody Schneider hey everybody how are you doing good how you doing good um so I'll not waste any time I start off with the idea that I have so uh what I have figured out in recent months is like since I've been like actively hiring a lot of candidates and also been pursuing a couple of job opportunities I've seen like a lot of companies generally tend to these companies are small startups or like individuals who are trying to hire they tend to like use Google forms or type forms in order to like get applicants to uh give their information to them so this part is good it's free of cost it's very seamless to create a Google form and just get your leads uh get your leads from those applicants but what happens after is sort of a nightmare like once you start getting like hundreds or thousands of applicants on those particular Google forms for that specific hiring purpose it's like very hard for you to sort out through all the resumés that you eventually find in those Google on those sheets effectively so you have to like sort of manually open each one of them and then like go through them and the second biggest problem with that is like once you are like up and running with all that sorting the problem is you are never returning back to the candidates that you have rejected it's like very rare for a Founder to actually go back to those 100 rejected candidates and reach out to them that you have been rejected based on those Google sheet responses so what I'm trying to build is sort of a better alternative for Google forms for specific hiring purposes where we let you create a sort of a form just like a Google form but after that everything else is just very efficient automated and you'll get all the leads directly your like dashboard in a Canan View and then you can simply sort them out together and what whoever you basically put down in rejected gets automated email and then whoever you basically move ahead and short list they get automated email and they get they get like sort of a calendly link to schedule your interviews that's the first part of it that's the MVP that we're launching on Monday uh and yeah the plans are big after that but I would really love to hear your feedback on that Greg you want you want to go first sure so it to like the way you portray it is it's like there's Google forms and then you but in reality isn't there other hiring platforms that people are using for sure uh there are a lot of hiring platforms that people are using like lever D Davin box is big in India and then there are a couple more others but the problem with that is either they are super expensive or it takes a lot of time to set up your branding your recruiter branding and like probably get your teammates on board and then start the hiring process but what I'm offering is basically a one touch solution to start off by simply creating a form just like you would on a Google form and then all the leads are basically part of your kban board so it saves you a lot of time and Hassle and if you're an indie hacker you don't have to like press on get a quote and basically get that company to give you a sales demo after that only you can start using it we are just basically a plug- in play software I mean to the the value ad is is obviously the ux but it's also just the price point like you're undercutting like those other platforms from what I understand are super expensive so like to me like what Zoho has done which is basically I'm going to go and copy every single SAS product and undercut it is a really great strategy and it's that Venture back one Greg it's called like gem or something like that yeah exact gem is reminds me of this but so I'd actually push back I think I would tap into the Google form so like something we thought about at one point was like oh there's probably a company like you know there's probably an opportunity to disrupt Survey Monkey right now because like what are you trying to do when you get surveys is understand what the data means right so like that's actually the end goal of this and so okay well what if you from the ground up you built this like surveys as a as as an you know from with AI built in from the ground up right so I think the angle I I would come from if I was you is like hey we are you know we're rank stacking for H hiring you know for applicants like we rank stack applicants for you based off of like what you're trying to hire and then they just drop in like you know whatever that ends up being they're like LinkedIn or what you know their resume Etc um but I I think that the go to market if people are already doing Google at like go Google forms and they're like yo we're getting you know a thousand different applicants there's no way that I can measure these against each other I would be that solution that plugs into that and then you can probably up sell them into like this other thing but whenever I'm building anything what I'm always trying to figure out is like okay what are they doing currently and like what is the end goal that they're trying to get through get to with the thing that they're doing currently and is there some way that I can fit into that workflow I can always like you know I'm GNA wedge in here within that timeline right I can always go out from where I wedge in but I need to find that like place for me to get that initial because it's going to be way harder for people to like to convince people to switch from a Google form to like here's the service you have to adopt right um yeah I mean this is probably a contradicting Viewpoint than uh like building the whole you know the whole model but I but I think that the differentiator in my mind is like we are what you're doing currently with like measuring candidates uh like Effectiveness as a as an applicant or like how good they're going to be as an employee we're gonna We Built This AI tool that does that automatically and then like basic you know to your point then it's like it's automatically saying no to people email wise it's automatically saying yes to people that it qualifies and then you just build in you know maybe their countly links automatically built in that gets sens out to them so that whole thing like you know as a recruiter then or or a Founder You're just showing up the meetings like you don't have to think about any of that process right um so I I I think that there's something in here I think it's figuring out it's like extracting the most valuable piece and like the most time consuming I you know I've done exactly what you're talking about right like most timec consuming part of this is measuring the people against each other and like going through that so like that component of it that where I would inject yourself figure out how do I tap into the data that they're already you know get like getting um and then uh that from there you can work your way out and into this like full service platform but in the beginning it can be just like a tool right it's a tool that attaches itself on to a bigger thing if the industry is already doing Google forms or type forms Etc like that's an easy way to convince them like oh you already have this set up like you just plug into us and it's done like we're already you know you tell us your your your your uh the outcomes you're looking here's the uh the responsibilities of this person and then it's just again rank stacking those against each other so yeah no for sure uh the thing that we are trying to do initially would be uh because after the Google forms process you generally end up with a Google Sheets and that can be exported as a CSV file so we would definitely allow users to like import a CSV file and basically put it in our dashboard and just sort it out very easily and then yes of course we have big plans for few like adding in uh have you ever seen that sort of a tool where you can like chat with a PDF that had been a very big recently so we are planning to build a sort of a tool integration into that particular platform where we would let you chat with the resume so if you have let's say a thousand resumés but you have that specific criteria you can simply chat with the resumés and then also so I'm just going to push back I don't know if people would want that right like that's the only thing I would say is like the are they do they want to chat with rumes like this is cool right but like do they want to do that thing so that like use that as the filter right again what's the job to be done it's taking a thousand candidates and turning it into 10 of the best right if you tell me that you have a software that t that does that and I'm paying somebody 40 hours a week to go and sort these things for me right yeah like you can I mean just do the math right like if I'm paying them we'll say 25 an hour 40 a week um that's 4,000 a month whatever right and you're telling me that okay I'm going to we'll charge you 25% of that cost so it's 750 a month to do that or whatever that number is or you know 10% of what that current cost is so 400 a month like that that is in a heartbeat you'll get people to pay for that thing because it's it's something they're doing currently and you're just you're just augmenting their what they're doing right it's like saving them time money or mental energy you're doing all three so just I that's the deliverable if I was in your shoes that's how I'd wedge into this Market again you can go like you're you're going to have your customers as soon as you get that traction they're going to ask you for so much more and then just be like yo can can you just give me a form like a form Builder or like can you just give me like where it's like they upload their resume and like their LinkedIn URL and like that's it right and then you you you go scrape all the data you organize all the data you rank stack all these PE you know you can you can go further out but I think again I that foothold would be what what is the thing they hate doing right now it's analyzing 100 you know a thousand different candidates oh we automate that for you that's an easy value CR that you can go and sell so and you do it cheap you do it cheap right and I think from an organic content perspective like there's a bunch of tweets that have gone viral that have been like I SP oh my God I can't believe I spend $2,500 on tip form a month um I spend 40 Grand a year on type form and I think showing what like I would basically repurpose some of those tweets and and then and that's your upsell right it's like yo you're paying you'll know too right like you'll have the volume that's going through their type form you'll be like hey like what you're paying this much like if you switch to our form like it's you know here's it's a tenth of the cost right and so again it's just it's when I you're always trying to piggyback off of things that are happening like what's the wave that's coming right now how do I ride that and then once I'm on that I can then build out all these other things right I can figure out all these upsells I can figure out that expansion Revenue but again it's it's it's the what's the the smallest thing that they aren't being servicedr currently so I mean to Greg's Point too like that's probably your GT like your go to market right it's just like look for tweets of people complaining about form cost and be like yo we built this free form thing that analyzes the results like sign up for free you get 10 free you know you can see how it works or whatever you know whatever your free trial or you know whatever your offer is so Cody you gotta run what are you up to what does a guy like Cody do on dude I'm going to I'm going to the park we got a we got a dog date with our friends I'm going to probably drink a bottle of wine and get sunburnt so that's my that's my plan for today but God bless you Cody Schneider thank you for anyway blessing us we appreciate you good luck man I I really think this is super I mean I think the the whole form and analyzing the data idea that's a massive opportunity right now again I think I think like all of these form companies can be disrupted if that's just built into it right again surveys to your employee piece and maybe that's that's that's your path right it's like you wedge in with this employe stuff and then it can expand I mean it's the same process right it's like form data what does this mean and like that could be the whole tool that you build so anyway yeah sure you later later later Cody yeah keep us informed too I love this stuff so hit me up with the updates Greg and I both want it so anyway we'll see you later later dude cool thanks s all right we've just hit two and a half hours W that is crazy that is crazy uh someone reminded me that the Clamato juice the Caesar as it's called is getting cold so without further Ado I'm going to go grab that have a sip sip and then I'm gonna invite some people back to the stage about to sip on some of that Clamato juice unfortunately but let's go grab it all right Sarah I'll be with you in a sec welcome welcome hello hello what's going on oh I was basically in my pj but then you sent me the invite I was like okay maybe I'm getting out of my pj I'll sip to that I'm gonna sip I'll sip to uh getting out of your PJs and hanging out in front of 137 of your closest friends well cheers hello everyone what's that this is disgusting so this is a um in Canada where where where are you living uh I'm in Berlin in Germany yeah so I don't know do they they have Bloody Mar's in Germany yes they do okay so in Canada they do it a bit weird so they have Bloody Marys but instead of tomato juice they put what's called Clamato juice what's that now what is that well they just took tomato juice and made it weird which is they took tomato juice and they put clam juice in it oh who wants to drink that no one but you know I'm drinking it because the the chat told me to do it and what the chat tells me to do I do so I'm sipping it and uh I keep my word so that's where we're at awesome perfect timing yeah so what what do you got for us so I spent some time doing some research on the topic of loneliness uh and and relationship it's kind of uh the latest Obsession um and there are some like crazy stats that over one billion people worldwi are like super lonely and the majority of this is very very young like genz um or even underage and so like I was like what why are those people Lely right and sometimes those people are lonely even if they are surrounded by by people so not necessarily physically isolated right and then I had the the idea that is like what if we could make relationships easy somehow and I think that to make a relationship easy uh you you need two things uh you need to first uh train your social skills in some cases and and second you need to be with people that you're highly compatible with and those people might not necessarily be in your immediate proximity and and so I thought um okay let me let me look uh who has this problem and I spend a lot of time on redit uh looking the the Reddit lonely Channel and people that use AI Companions and what they right is absolutely mindblowing like the majority of you know those people okay do not have real friends in real life and uh but they would like to well some are per are perfectly fine just chatting with a chat bot you know on their couch respect but others would like instead to have friends in in real life and so I thought about okay but then we we need to meet them where they are right and so I thought about creating a sort of character that AI meets dingo for social skills though not for language training meets Bumble so basically like Ani companion that you can personalize you can give it a name like a bit like character. AI but instead of just talking with a chatbot aimlessly the goal of this chatbot is to train your social skill so that when you unlock a a certain level then you get matched with people in real life life but it's different from the way that dating app or like friendship app do the matching uh you need to be matched with some people with people that are are your same Readiness level and that you're highly compatible with so that it's easier for you to bong with those people that's what I mean relationship made easy so you have the training part and then you have like the the matching part so that's the that's the overall idea so I mean I think you should explain what character AI is for people who don't know what it is yeah so character AI is basically cha GPT like cha GPT but you can give it a personality so Imaging you can create like the psychology character or the uh training coach um character or I don't know I saw very popular Elon Musk right and the and the chat but instead of being quite generic will try to impersonate the character that you create as much as possible so the people so I buy so first of all the whole loneliness epidemic uh I buy I buy the fact that especially younger people like can't even look other people in the eye and it's it's getting you know social skills are getting worse and worse but the people actually is there a big enough market of people who actually want to improve their social skills mhm from from preliminary research I will say yes but I don't have yet the numbers to prove it to you and I I did a lot of research if there were some numbers around like I I really spent some time doing this and I couldn't find anything so I'm thinking okay how do I validate this thing and the way I was thinking of uh proving my assumption is uh well first of all like doing some ads on on Instagram and Tik Tok but also start producing organic content on this topic and see if people Vibe with this and then like I was thinking okay then I can funnel maybe some people into Discord create a Discord bot I Alpha I'm I already started sort of you know with a bit of JavaScript Etc to do that um and then see if the concept uh holds right yeah yeah totally I have this concept some of some of the people already know it called the ACP funnel Right audience Community product so you start with the audience convert to the community and then you build the product so I don't know if this is going to be a really big idea what worries me is it costs a lot of money to build the product but I do think there might be another product that might be cheaper to build that actually might end up help you know being the solution and I think starting with the audience talking about it converting a subset of those people into a Discord but I would be I I would definitely grab their email addresses and um phone numbers uh to join it um and then from there uh create a product the issue with like competing you're not competing with character AI but character AI for XYZ is that the price to go and build something like that is just you know it's going to cost a lot of money so you want to make sure that if you're going to be spending XYZ dollars that you're going to be returning 5x or 10x 15x yeah yeah for sure know this is something that if if you have any sort of you know traction you you need probably VC money yeah totally I don't think I can you know build it on my own uh at all I have another hypothesis though for for like a early adopter that is also like people that have like similar need but different is like people that have gone through a recent breakup or a divorce and maybe those people are a better payer also because they're usually a bit older and uh but but if you think about it they need kind of the same right so like I have this Persona in mind that is like okay so maybe this person is like 30 something 35 38 or so they just gone through like a divorce older friends are like in a relationship or have kids so they don't really have time you know but and also you don't want to like always talk about how heartbroken you are to your friends because after a while it's boring right totally so and so maybe you need like a like Ani companion that sort you know that doesn't get bored no matter how much you say oh my God you know I'm my heart broken or stuff like that right and then you can uh also sort of like help those people transition from their previous relationship to the new one like sort of bridging them and then match them you know with their idea romantic partner yeah I mean I think that to me is like niching down in a way so I think that focusing on them is probably where I'd start and also from an audience building perspective it's just a lot more clear like what you'd actually create and um so that's what I would do if I were you I'd build an audience focus on on one of those and then see where it goes right like you never know where the audience is going to take you so thank you so much for coming up um I'll sip some Cato for to that unfortunately thanks Greg I appreciate it and uh yeah uh come back soon thank you CH Chow all right we have two more people that we are going to bring up and then I gotta go I really gotta go so I'm already getting late so let's uh let's bring you how do I pronounce your name it's jovanka if you're in the states and if you're anywhere else in the world it's joov Vana but you can call me Joe interesting well welcome Joe thanks for uh thanks for joining us and I like your T-shirt andk you and uh what's on your mind oh thank you one for inviting Greg you have become like my brown noise my green noise like I listen to you so much my son is like are you listening to that like so I I thank you for having me up and thank you for being you know on socials and allowing me to find you um so I have a couple of things I know I sent you a few of them yeah and just between Josh and Paulo yeah sorry and Paulo just so many different things so just tell me which one do you want a fun one or do you want a hardcore one I want the one that speaks to you the most well okay so then that would be like the first one which would be the um assistant for the add or the ADHD or the manic entrepreneur I think one of your podcast you had earlier this week where you had the manic entrepreneur that's right and I so identify with that um so what I've been doing with you know thank God for gp40 and some of the other platforms and apps and stuff I've built an AI well I call her my friend her name is June right so I quot June um so June kind of automates and pardon I'm redoing my office so pardon the mess um June automates a lot of the task the people that have ADD or ADHD or just have that I don't feel like participating in adulthood today but we have to make our money so she goes through a lot of the Monday tasks that need to get done and then let's say you know God forbid there's an urgent email from you know your your your child's school or you know your your your job if you have a regular 9 to5 it will notify you so that you can address that issue but everything else you know I'll say okay today I want to work on this app tailor made you were talking about resonate so I have another app where you upload your LinkedIn profile profile whatever you want to say about yourself your resume and you upload the JB the job description and it will create a tailored resume specifically for that job using language and so it's not lying or anything like that but it's just really niching down and speak into that job description so um so this way you have a better chance of you know and it's not AI because it is you you know so these are just some of the things so she does that for me June takes care of what like okay so I gave her Specific Instructions this is what I need you to do ask questions and then show build the road map show me you know what it needs what needs to be done what resources are needed and things like that and you know I think it works for me and it works for a few other of my friends you know that have high level positions and they just don't feel like working sometimes like Joe can you just send me that you know so on the GPT store I've been doing a few things so that one has like really been what I've been working on because I have a crap ton of ideas yeah like you one of your podcast you're talking about ideas literally I have ideas upon upon ideas but they never get completed because ADD and ADHD right so it's helped a lot so I wanted to get some feedback on what you thought about like you know maybe a subscription base or something or what you thought a sip a dip a pip what no so this is a this is a sip in in on paper it's a sip um and I want to talk more about that so I I think that the idea of building products for people with ADD and ADHD there's just not enough products for that Community period And I think that people who who you know who have ADD or ADHD like they you know it's kind of like real recogniz is real like they understand other people who have it and it is that you know it's not just drugs that are going to help right I think agents could help more than drugs in a lot of ways um sometimes so I think uh I love the idea you know it's kind of similar to what we were talking about with Sarah um in terms of ACP funnel like I would build I'd start with an audience around just like building you know talking about ad and ADHD and tips and breaking it down and also like famous people who have DHD like I think that would you know be really cool to learn about like okay you know uh Julius Caesar had add and this is like how he lived his life and like let me tell you the story you're you're leaning on the credibility of other people um I think I would probably use Twitter to start to build that audience andate threads that a lot of them have videos because that's just what's working on the algorithm right now absolutely yeah and then I think in terms of like the product here's like the reason why I'm like uh about the product is like yes I believe that something like this should exists same like I believe that something like this should exist for Sarah but the issue is to build what you want even if you're using something someone mentioned crew AI uh which I think crew AI would help um it's basically uh you know you can go to their website but AI agents for real use cases um so it's an open source tool that lot of you know everyone here should check out I just think that building what you want to build is going to be a lot of money and expensive and and that sort of thing so I wonder if you can just do the same sort of strategy as Sarah you build an audience you build the community maybe you do some like lightweight AI a water down a water down version to start um and then eventually sort of build up but I like the idea to me it's a sip and thank you for bringing bring coming up and sharing it with us thank you can I ask you about one more uh a new a whole other idea holder yes told to you don't have to give me inut I just well you can just say sipper or you know drip okay sip sipper spit I'll give you a sipper fit the CH yeah so um so many people you know I watch YouTube that's my guilt and pleasure as with most you know and you know of course you look at the luxury travel and the people that are doing you know a A7 was A380 you know from you know I I'm I'm like H I live in New York and I live in Dubai so it's it's pretty expensive you know if you want to fly business in first and I usually don't so um I found you know like skip lagged and stuff like that so I kind of created my own scraper where you can do like if you have time for people that have time they have a little extra money and you you know you're you're free with your schedule if you can find in first class ticket to you know Sydney for $600 but you know you have to go through you know K lur or something like that but you're still flying first class from New York to so that's something I've been working on too yeah that's it that was just a wait so how is that is that just like a first class version of skip lagged it it is it's but it's for people that have open you know have an open itinerary they don't care it could be two years from now they don't care here they just want to fly first class for I like that one that's a sip for I mean it's a sip like I I think it's a good idea because I've used skip lag before and it it's worked really well and it's kind of like a hack but I think uh that's a good small business idea that you can create and just go to upwork and just be like you know this is what you I'm working like the framework I use your I use your funnel system exactly I I use I use like a lot of your stuff like thank you so much we have no idea like I make AI out of like almost everything you say I make a bot to help me carry it out so yeah that one is I'm working on that one that one's actually coming out soon I just don't have a name for it um but I've been working on the framework for because who doesn't want to save money who doesn't want to fly first class exactly period come on how do you not sip to that okay and people are loving it too not just me in the chat people are loving it and J even says I love Joe so thank you I love you guys too yeah so lots of love for Joe lots of sips for Joe and and thank you gotta come back again come on come thank you so so much I appreciate your time I appreciate you and you know appreciate the sipping on the nasty stuff I have some homemade lemonade that but I appreciate you and having me up and you know I'm I'm G to add value to you that's been my biggest takeaway like adding I'm I'm I'm stalking you like you said so I can add some value I love it all right thank you Joe thanks so much guys thank you so much all right last but not least patiently awaiting I sorry I was seeing you waiting there and I was like sorry but uh we got to you no worries no worries I'm happy to be on here I've been following your stuff for and Cody's stuff for for a while now so it's cool to be on here I didn't think I would be doing doing this on my Saturday so that's awesome um I'll jump into it so I sent you a Instagram message uh I've been a marketer for like seven years uh I just left a B2B software company they're like series C and I joined around seed um and I was just kind of sick of the VC hamster wheel um because like only one out of a 100 people actually uh have a good end result um and so I wanted to do a startup and I was kind of inspired by you and like Andrew Wilkinson um and I wanted to something that I had experience in so I was looking around at all these digital marketing uh certification companies like digitalmarketer.com career Foundry and and some other ones and I was like this space looks like it's a little old um I thought their marketing was like a six out of 10 seemed really expensive um they only posted like a couple hundred times a year rather oh [ __ ] he's gone there's back and uh I'm back I'm back um and I looked at the space and I just thought I estimated these five companies probably do about 30 million a year in um revenue for like digital marketing certifications and I thought maybe somebody could just come in with a more modern approach towards remote work um and hire professors who are already marketers at companies like Google and Netflix and Airbnb um so I've been working on that for like the last two months and and launch that um so I wanted to get your feedback on that um because I can either keep going with that or I can just build a B2B um SAS marketing agency what's the name of for the oh it's called remote marketer I sent you on Instagram kind of like some context and links so you can just get a quick visual remot marketer.com is that what it's called it's with a dash between remote and marketer couldn't afford couldn't afford the real one okay we're gonna we're GNA pull it up and we're going to share screen this is just a uh a boot camp page so my thinking was cool it's do a free boot camp send YouTube traffic to it make everything free and then if anybody wants help like we can have a course that I'll build out later in the year with like professors from like Adobe and stripe who are actually marketing teachers um and I just like the idea of having digital products and having like an audience so I went with this um but I realized it's a lot different than like B2B SAS marketing so uh yeah any any questions um like how's this going like how's the funnel the funnel working so I've done like nine videos on YouTube three like long videos and uh like six shorts I have like close to a th views I haven't got much traffic through here but my thinking was just post like 2,000 times a year on YouTube yeah to have all the content go on Twitter LinkedIn Etc and uh Implement ads so it's it's pretty early but um close to like a thousand views for like nine videos with a lot of shorts and so the question is basically do should you continue I mean you can still keep this top of the funnel but should you build a boot camp like a paid Boot Camp or should you just focus on B2B SAS marketing yeah like should I further develop this out and compete with like digital marketer.com and like um a career Foundry and and some of the other courses it's kind of like a I'm trying to build like a lomda school but for marketing if you know LDA is but why would why would you pivot so early like what makes you want to Pivot so early uh because like I get a couple messages a month of just inbound request asking for um B2B SAS marketing help just because I've been doing it for like five years and I'll get like three stups a month and I I keep turning them down and I'm like I feel like I'm just saying no to money and and you can't do both you don't think you can do both I I probably could I mean I could do both but I was like oh splitting focus is I'm not Elon Musk I should do I should do one thing yeah and but you still nothing has changed in terms of your thesis on the boot camp right no no I think I think both I think both could work but I was like should I just like should I have stayed in the lane I was in and keep building Agency for that or I don't know it was just kind of could you hire could you hire someone to either do the boot camp Camp stuff like even when I say hire maybe even partner like part basically you know I'm just trying to think like if you want to focus only on the you know mostly on the the two things right let's just say you can focus on two things the front door which is going to be creating YouTube content and free boot camp and then the second thing is let's just say the agency maybe you'll spend the other 50% of your time on the agency could you find someone to can you just do a deal with someone who either wants to start an agency or has a small agency and be like we'll split the revenue uh I could yeah I I can have two partners for the I have twin brother uh who's also in marketing and stff so like I kind of have a clone um so I can do that with him and then I also you had a clone you had a clone you didn't lead off with that no no I'm used to it but uh yeah the agency I can start with him because he's a B2B stas marketer and then also one of our old bosses who's like a VP and has more experience and like a bigger Network um yeah like I could I could do that like oh everybody says an entrepreneurship you need to focus and not do multiple things but um yeah but you're not doing multiple things if you have a clone or someone like that partner yeah right yeah he has a full-time he has a full-time job at a seed stage startup so it's like he's he slammed yeah I mean my advice to you is if you would have told me like I'm not really sure on this boot camp thing and here's the reasons why that's one thing but I think if you never go back to the if you never end up doing the paid boot camp thing it's always going to be like a what if so right until you learn that I I would I would stick with it but I would find a way to refer I mean saying no to clients potential clients is kind of dumb kind of dumb right because at the very least you can refer them to to another partner and at the very least get 10% of the revenue like literally like like at the very least so that's true then the next level of that is you strike a real partnership with another potential partner and they do the Fulfillment or a small group and you split it maybe 30% or 40% um and uh so that's my that's my quick feedback on that idea I I would just say don't don't give up on it like the I think the idea of like digital marketer certifications and boot camps you know done in 2024 is a great idea and there's like a bunch of proven ways around how you can acquire traffic how you can convert that traffic and then how you can monetize that traffic I feel like you're just seeing the dollar signs come in with the agency stuff and you're and you're it's conflicting yeah yeah 100% yeah yeah I really appreciate that thank you man my pleasure all right thanks Isaac awesome all right see you take care and just like that we've hit three hours live when I woke up this morning I definitely didn't think I'm gonna be drinking Cato juice three you know for three hours in front of a bunch of amazing people from the internet but we did it and we had a good time I want to thank you for showing up on your Saturday and spending time with me and everyone here um this was really fun and if you had fun maybe maybe you can just share the channel share the podcast startup ideas podcast with your friends uh you can get more of me

brainstorm the other day uh and it was not nearly as fun and as good as this because we couldn't bring people on stage and now we are able to bring people on stage so that's that was huge so um again enjoy your weekend hope we got the creative juices flowing and uh I'll sip I'll sip to you all cheers later e e

I want to talk Chrome extensions cuz like I am obsessed with them so like if I was a developer and like an engineer and I was trying to figure out okay what's my first product and like how can I like build this portfolio company this is where I would spend all of my time the whole strategy here is like find something related to like data scraping or some type of like extraction from a web page that they're going on because like most of the time when people think Chrome extensions they immediately go to like honey or like any of the you know or grammarly these massive tools I'm not talking about that I'm talking about what is a job to be done that's like super small like getting data out of red fin as an example because they don't have an API and so building's a tool that's like that and then you go and you buy like the exact match domain name for that Target keyword you go you build like 30 links to it and you'll get it to rank page one and then that turns into your top of funnel you have a free tier then you have some type of bump pricing based off of usage and you put them into an email nurture to get them to convert

this will make minimum 1 million per year what if we look back to the things that were popular and exciting when we were 14.5 and you try to Milk The Nostalgia out of those things to create new products and I'll give you an example I was obsessed with the video game Halo back when I was like 13 14 uh and I used to do land parties uh a lot back then they're some of the best memories of my entire life and if I'm thinking okay so that's a memory that I had that I really deeply loved but what could be something you could do okay it's a comforting memory maybe I could start a twitch Channel where I just run land parties with like you know eight other people in a physical space and you're not trying to make content that's like super educational it's Comfort noise you're making comforting episodes that last 3 hours long you're just chatting about [ __ ] so if you can become the content creator for the new Millennial retro you're want to make yourself a [Music] millionaire and we are back Jonathan ja cream Courtney that's me that's me it's literally you speaking into a metal rectangle you said you had something to talk to me about I did so I sent you a text message and I said I saw this thing I saw this survey and also something else happened and I somehow it's connected in my mind and we need to talk about it because I think your audience needs to hear about it uh and then I couldn't find the survey and and then you found it so that was the whole thing um the survey is called or actually well I don't know what the exactly the name of the survey but the the important part of it is called Nostalgia tends to Peak at a single age and nostalgia in this case you can see uh I I guess you'll see this in the video version um in the study they asked people when uh you know when was the most moral society when were the happiest families when was the best music when was the best fashion when was the best economy um when was the best television when was the best cuisine and it asked people to sort of rate when these things were the best uh Accord according to them and it it was um like people it it asked people from like a broad range of Ages a lot of people came to the same kind of or a lot of people's answers lined up with that basically the best stuff the best movies the best everything happens happened sometimes between sometime between when people are like 10 years old and 20 years old so Nostalgia Peaks somewhere in between 10 and 20 I think they did they like bring it down to 14.5 so like basically somewhere between the age of 14 and 15 is where like your Nostalgia absolutely peaked what do you think about that one Greg so I was eating okay so I'm in Montreal right now and the dish here that people eat is poutine which is fries you know it you know it I had it yeah you know it and it's fries gravy and cheese curds so I'm chowing down on this poutine in my American friend who's never seen a poutine in his life goes why are you eating that and I I never even didn't question it you know I've been eating it my whole whole life um and he's like you know just soggy fries so I was thinking am I do I like this or do I just like it because it reminds me of my childhood mhm yeah well it could be a little bit of both but it's probably more of the Nostalgia element of it I guess yeah although it is pretty good it is yeah maybe a bit of both so I think that I mean what I want to talk about is why did does this matter within the context of startup ideas yeah so I think it so I I think I have an idea of how to how to land this uh although it might not work um today at this so uh the reason this came back to my mind earlier and the reason why I messaged you is because today I bought a very cool thing uh and because it launched today and it's something called a mod retro which is Palmer luy's new physical product Palmer lucky is the guy who invented the Oculus and he also runs andural which is like a defense contractor right now and he's also really into video games he used to be like a Game Boy modder and he created this mod retro which is like a ridiculously detailed and loving Recreation of the Game Boy Color I guess it's the Game Boy Color I just bought the orange one if you're if you're wondering which color I went for and I looked at this page and I was immediately like I need to get this this is something I have to get now I had a game Boy Color um I think I was I don't know actually exactly what age I was when I saw this and I I knew I had to buy it I started thinking back to this um back to this study and I was like I actually have a weird thing about buying nostalgic things in general like there are things where when I see a YouTube video of it or when I see like a um for example I just got uh a Game Boy DS because I remembered having it as a teenager and I was excited about it and it's not not really that I end up playing these things or even using them but just having them gives me sort of like a comforting feeling I can't really exactly describe it and I started to look around and realize that so many of the things that I buy and so many of the things that I do I'm looking to the other side of my apartment here and I can see a lot of radio head uh vinyls and they're all of the radio they're all of the albums that I was listening to on repeat when I was 15 um I was listening to Kid a like on repeat over and over and over um but also like the teenage engineering products that I love and I obsess about and this is also teenage engineering object it's just like hyper nostalgic hyper nostalgic designs um and I was thinking right okay startup ideas we're always looking for ideas we're always looking for new angles what if you look at people like okay we're Millennials we look back to the things that were popular and exciting when we were for 14.5 hey everyone if you're anything like me you've got a ton of design work that you need websites landing pages emails social assets you name it but you don't just want beautiful landing pages or beautiful websites you want the stuff that's going to convert you want the stuff that's going to actually drrive value that's where design scientist.com comes in it's an agency that for one monthly price will do all your design work all your copy work all your engineering and do stuff that actually scales your Revenue you don't need a designer you need a design scientist let's go design scientist.com I liked it so much I invested in the business and you try to Milk The Nostalgia out of those things to create new products and I'll give you an example of like a business that I think you could make relatively good money out of and I want to go like hyper over thetop specific here um one business could literally be looking at something I was obsessed with the video game Halo um back when I was like I don't know like 13 12 13 14 uh and I used to do land parties uh a lot back then uh this is where if for for any Millennials listening you'll know what this is you literally would like connect your Xboxes with a cable we would all sit around in in my house in Ireland and destroy the place um but we it was like they're some of the best memories of my entire life and if I'm thinking okay so that's a memory that I had that I really deeply loved but I don't see anyone massively taking advantage of you know exploiting that memory but what could be something you could do okay it's a comforting memory maybe I could start a twitch Channel where I just run you know once a week or even you know once every day if you want to go hardcore I run land parties with like you know other people in a physical space Halo uh maybe Halo 2 as well to to to add in the you know dual wielding for any of the people who know you could you could hold two guns at the same time was pretty cool and honestly just I I honestly think just streaming something like this and then turning that into other types of content maybe a weekly podcast um talking about Halo and Halo 2 a genu I don't know how much money you could make out of it but if you look at something like the kind of funny Games cast which is a daily gaming podcast more focused on the news side of things I think you could make a fair amount of money doing advertising in a piece of media like that at least for a while and then you add in the next thing uh another example another thing I think you could do which would be pretty fun is you could like create and I heard I was listening to um my first million today and they were talking about these specialty print magazines and I was thinking like I was one of the very few people who had a Dreamcast video game console and there was like four of us in the world but you could definitely create something really high-end for us four people maybe like a ridiculously nice coffee table book for all of the nostalgic uh video games and all of the elements of the Dreamcast that were like that would just get someone like me drooling um and yeah I don't know man there's just something to this idea of looking at what was hot what was exciting what made you feel super cozy and it is a comfort thing it's not about making like an amazing new creative thing it's like how do you bring back that sense of comfort uh to the Millennials who just crave that sense of like oh man that was such a that was such a cool thing that was such an amazing time you know what I mean am I getting this point across at all dude this this hits home this really really hits home to me so but I I want to I want to respond to your to your your idea I'm gonna respond to your idea first wait were what console what kind of console boy were you when you were like 14 15 I wasn't a console boy I was a Counter Strike efficient a I was basically I was a PC Gamer and I took it really really seriously and that honestly was what got me onto the internet and really just like meeting people from all over the world joining teams uh competing uh compeed in the world cyber games tournament a worldwide tournament the Cyber games the Cyber games so yeah I'm a nerd I'll say it and it was an incredible experience so I think the idea of a land party is something that is extremely special but I wouldn't go about it from a twitch angle because there's the secondary Trend around IRL happening right now yeah so I think that there's an opportunity to if so house was creating land parties what would that look like it's funny because I was thinking okay first I was thinking yeah but that's just a [ __ ] creepy internet cafe but that's the thing internet cafes are now really creepy and weird because like who goes into them you know I I don't exactly creepy people creepy people but um if you were to have a place for millenn like professional Millennials to go where they could do multiplayer games that they basically also the other thing is like once you turn like 20 you kind of stop gaming in the way you used to when you were in a te you were a teenager and also you cannot compete against people playing Counter Strike now like I'm 36 if I try to play any online multiplayer game including the new Halo infinite I can I can last like three seconds but if I could go to a place I honestly I'm always thinking about like what are some alternative ideas to bars where you go drinking and you know what dude [ __ ] I also and I've been talking to my girlfriend about this a lot I hate going to dinner parties I hate going to bars and just sitting around in a circle and talking to people it's so intense and what I used to do when I was a teenager is we would play games together we wouldn't sit all facing each other we had something to do while we were kind of chatting and shooting the [ __ ] and I think one of the things that I I really miss and I'm trying to bring it back into my like social life is just doing stuff when you're hanging out with your friends instead of just sitting around drinking smoking whatever it is I feel like having a central activity and if we could if we could have a Soho house uh with land party combo dude I would be so in I would be so in yeah and I also think the yeah with the other Trend around sober curious people and people becoming sober uh board games are becoming more popular card games are becoming more popular you throw in land parties there maybe during the day it could be a place where you can kind of wework work maybe you can you can work there and and be creative but at night that's when maybe there's just organized games like you need someone to organize it and there needs to be structure so for example I saw a friend of mine actually this is a guy his his Twitter handle internet Vin he's like a an entrepreneur and I was actually surprised he wrote playing Counter-Strike tomorrow night uh in North York which is a in Toronto getting two rooms for 5v5 we have eight people but need two more let me know ASAP if you want in and you're just starting to see little things like that where people are like yeah I do want a game I do want to be in real life so that's why I like this idea and it's kind of if you think about it a lot of the most famous entrepreneurs like okay Palmer lucky also Elon also just a lot of people who are in startups are kind of nerds maybe that's also a great way to just meet other very interesting entrepreneurs in a way again I I cannot stress enough how much I don't like sitting at a table and facing people and having to interact with them the only way I can do that is like and find it interesting is when we're drinking like when you're out at a bar and you're all sitting around a table it's just kind of intense if you're stuck next to someone and you kind of have to talk or else you're going to be weird but if you have something to do I mean I'm a nerd I find it awkward I think to just sit directly across from someone and talk to them but if you have something to do I think you can have some pretty interesting conversations Halo golden eye all that kind of [ __ ] um there's something to it I know that people have tried to open Arcade bars but like I'm not talking about arcades that's not the vibe I'm talking about yeah Halo yeah I'm talking about coaches I'm talking about also standing sometimes yeah yeah and I know someone's going to be listening to this and be like but but that's going to cost me $200,000 to open up a space like that and then I'm going to be on the hook for $10,000 a month of rent and then my ENT to you listener is slow down what does the smallest version of this look like well it looks like just organizing games it's organizing game nights yeah um and maybe you do game nights with entrepreneurs like Halo for entrepreneurs Halo for designers Halo for XYZ and then you move on to other games and then you can eventually charge for it I'd love it honestly if someone does this in Berlin I'm in like I'd rather be paying for this than a lot of other like cuz this goes into a bigger topic by the way you know this um idea that when AI gets better we're all going to have nothing to do and actually entertainment becomes more and more important like filling your time with entertainment it sounds ridiculous I also saw this guy on Twitter um he was kind of giving this he was doing this post maybe you saw it it was like since 1885 we've been living in a world of abundance and so we don't need to do anything most of us are just making up our work look what we're doing right now dude and so entertainment becomes super super important and it becomes an actual important industry because we're all so going to be so bored and I think yeah just tapping into that Nostalgia tapping into the IRL thing dude internet um online gaming did not kick off for me at all the last time I really enjoyed uh multiplayer gaming was Halo 3 with a friend of mine Alex in person I just I'm not the the I I'm not the multiplayer gamer but I love gaming I I want to go hang out and play games with people I am the multiplayer gamer my favorite part about gaming is like what internet Vin was talking about five versus five and like being on a team and playing in a team sport yeah and coming up with strategies and do you still do it do you still like play a lot of PC game PC gaming not not not nearly enough cuz I I have a Mac and Counter Strike 2 which is the latest Counterstrike I can't play because it's on a Mac and I just can't I don't know I don't I don't want to set up like a separate rig just for Counter Strike so rig you should though I should treat yourself it's more of just like yeah honestly you're right I should you should just do it yeah another uh another Steam I have the steam deck here for anyone who hasn't seen it um the steam store is also full to the brim of games that tap into different types of nostalgia right now I'm playing a game called batro uh which is just like a it's kind of looks like solitaire but it's kind of like a weird haunted poker game um I'm also playing a game called Road Warden at the moment which again is just fullon uh Game Boy Color Vibes which is super cool and it really appeals to me me I think there's just this I don't know there I I also love like AAA video games but there's something deep there's something that like drags deep into my soul and deep into my wallet when I see anything uh relating to video gaming from when I was younger like that that mod retro I just I didn't even read I was like I need it I need it right now and by the way the shipping to Europe is almost the same price as the object and I still had to have it if they can do that to me there's a there's a market the other tangential idea I have to to your Insight is how do you take something like a nostalgic uh product like let's say the Game Boy Color and create high-end expensive art out of it oh so you so that's what this is like the prompt for people listening which is go think about what was meaningful to you as a 14-year-old because if it was meaningful to you there's probably other people was meaningful to it could be as silly as poutine it could be as fun as a Dreamcast but and everything in between and then go think okay how do I create a really expensive uh object that's somehow a piece of art that I can sell on the internet and then talking tactics then you just you either build Niche websites get a lot of SEO track traffic and then convert them to the high-end products or you just run paid ads I know you're a big paid ads guy I love paid ads yeah you love paid you love paid ads as much as you love Halo I shot like 30 new ads today I saw some guy on Twitter say that meta ads uh I can't remember who it was I should remember this stuff uh to get them a shout out actually he did a great job maybe I should give him a shout out so you bring him on your your pod um he is like this ads expert and he was talking about the idea that like a lot of people who are running paid ads just don't run actually enough ads um and so the algorithm can't really tell which things are working you know as in the more ads you have the more likely you are to find the winners and then you can kind of double down on those winners but it like takes a while to find the winners I'm not going to go fully into that now but uh I can't find it it was really good I I recorded loads of ads back to nostalgia noal people are going to be get dude you know what people are going to get nostalg when when the people who are 15 years old watching the ads with me and them right now in 15 years I going to be nostalgic to them oh 100% people who are listening to this podcast yeah and and seeing us hang out at this particular time and it's going to be like 2042 and they're going to be listen listening and they're going to be like oh I remember remember when you know it was 10 p.m. and Jonathan was like hanging on a couch and he was eating this USB drive it's fully bedtime for me my eight sleep is like pissed off right now that I'm not that I that my eight sleep is going to be angry that I did this podcast so late but I just had the urge to tell you about this graph yeah yeah I mean isn't there a quote there you you don't step into a river twice no man steps into a river twice is that relating to the eight sleep uh kind of bursting and soaking the whole bed or no but sort of um it's related to a river it's related to Great explanation the river changes it's a flowing river right so it's changing over time so if you step in it right in 2024 and you step in it in 2025 it's a different River it's seeing different things uh is this relating to like if I hadn't told you the idea the idea would have changed tomorrow or is this related to something Nostalgia related here's the here's the quote no man ever steps into the same river twice that's true River moves on River moves on I think I just kind of I I just don't why why are you saying this quote because I don't know man I don't know but we got to leave this in I like leave this in I guys I don't know why Greg said that but later when I'm watching back I'll be like oh yeah like how didn't I get that like I don't know why you said that quote yeah I just I I just wanted to confuse you I could pretend that I oh yeah you're right yes um twice yes River I understand yes oh smart quote there that is a great it is actually it is a great quote um uh like for something I suppose yeah it is a really good quote because the whole point is that nothing change nothing is the same nothing is the [Laughter] same before we head out Nostalgia if you wanted to create a high-end collectible company based on Nostalgia how do you come up with the idea and actually how do you get started you know do you create a landing page do you use SEO paid ads like walk us through a bit of the your framework for thinking about how to start one of these businesses I do think that content would be the easiest way to start um and and that content would probably be you know let's say Metal Gear Solid is probably one of those things that a lot of people in my generation were like obsessed with um I remember like everyone looking at every detail of the trailer for mgs2 it was one of these just obsessive things and so what I would probably do is realistically start a YouTube channel and I would maybe do a series on one specific game uh and that series would be like breaking down what made it so special like um I I would try to recapture the excitement of looking at the trailers and it would be almost like a little kind of you know low-end documentary about maybe something like Metal Gear Solid for example um I I would try to get an audience basically I would try to get as much of an audience as possible and honestly if I'm thinking about a high-end product just in something that I would know how to create I would probably create a coffee table book uh something like we talked about the um last week this guy who does the video game magazine um what was it called a something waste of time I actually have it literally right behind me uh what was it called a AP o Dude I don't know it was in the podcast last week I know I know exactly I can picture the website I don't know what it's I don't know called he's really leaning into this like he he's interviewing video game developers who worked on games from like you know 10 dude you know uh one of the biggest reveals this week in the PlayStation event I'm obsessed with the video game industry by the way uh one of the biggest reveals this week in the PlayStation event uh one of the biggest showcases was Silent Hill 2 and so that would be an example that's getting remade like if you played a game that really stuck with you that you became obsessed with that you got really into making content about that product and I I wouldn't even sell it like the high-end product probably would be a coffee table book about like um either one game or it's about the a couple of games that came out for maybe maybe there's like a special uh coffee table book just for the PS1 or just for the PS2 or just for Halo um that would be probably my angle what would yours be or oh I got I got one more I got one more um controllers like refurbishing controllers uh like PlayStation 1 controllers or X box controllers um like just making them I don't know making them into like some sort of object that you can have in the house maybe it's just the face plate of the controller I don't know some something with that you know I would really really Niche down so I would be like the channel for I don't know mar Mario Brothers you know just really really Niche Niche down and just talk about that uh video first 100% yeah short form probably first and then you really just need like one or two of those clips to go viral to get you know I was talking to a friend of mine this morning he just had one of he's like in The Entrepreneur Space and he had one of his Clips uh get 10 10 or 12 million views and he got like 30,000 or 20,000 subs from it wow and you so you just need like one of those to go viral and then you have your base and then from there you can create other channels and just start using your Mario channel to to push to uh your Zelda Channel and I would think about what are games I think the Silent Hill uh example is really smart because now all of a sudden people are like oh I forgot about Silent Hill yeah but there's a group of people who are not going to buy Silent Hill 2 but who would buy Silent Hill one nostalgic items right so that's where it comes it all comes back to searching on Reddit and seeing where there's growth areas in certain games and and and picking the one strategically I think also is something what I would be doing so you would also sort of do a Content first approach yes content first and then just see what sort of things like I think also even something as basic if if you go to the kajima website hideio kajima has a his own company now he's the guy who made Metal Gear Solid and I actually buy like the [ __ ] on that website I have his hat from the death stranding video game I buy the little keychains all that kind of stuff I think but you know what I think would work best forget about if forget I love the big the high-end idea the high-end product idea I would just advertise other people's high-end nostalgic products on my super long form threeh Hour episode per week conversation between me and you talking about reminiscing about our gaming time during like the you know late 90s and early 2000s honestly yeah yeah and you know what we the name of the show would be called the good old days the good old remember the good old days I remember the good old days I remember it there's actually a podcast that if you guys want to check out an example of like it's not exactly what we're talking about but there's an element of it because it's more about the industry it's called Game Boys to Men by Jeff gersman I don't know if you can get it for free I pay for access to it um and it's like this guy and his friend reminiscing about the games industry in the 90s but I think there's a game Boys to Men for Mi Millennials talking about Halo Silent Hill 2 metal gear salt guys if you're listening to Greg's podcast right now let me see if this does something to you you've lost your entire audience first of all that means quite literally nothing to me you don't know if you're listening to this and you heard what I just did you put it in the comments we got to we got to tell Greg what he's listening to yeah no can know that one no I was a Nintendo Nintendo guy and a PC Gamer okay let's see if you know this Nintendo one Zelda Ocarina of Time man yeah all right can I tell you about a business related to Nostalgia that I think you're going to like and I think probably does at least $5 million a year yes all right it is called grid studio. CC do you know about this business I don't I'm looking it up now so it's brilliant it's basically doing something similar to what I was talking about where you take Nostalgia and you make high-end art pieces of it although I don't I actually don't think it's as high-end as I would do it so what do they do they get original parts from original game Boyson [ __ ] so [ __ ] cool I knew you'd love this I knew you'd love this and they take the original parts uh and even like newer is things like the Apple watch but first generation and they put it in a art frame and they just kind of annotate it and it's just a beautiful piece of art like so they'll take out a Game Boy and you can see all the inner workings on on a beautiful art piece and it's just it's a beautiful homage to the device dude you know what's so weird remember earlier I I haven't seen this before but remember earlier when I said I would take the face plate off the controller and yeah I didn't explain what I would I was imagining putting it on some type of frame but this is way cool I wasn't thinking about this exploded view but honestly the looking at the um Xbox original Duke controller version of this gives me that feeling of nostalgia oh my God this is so cool look at do you see the snz one so good the [ __ ] game boy oh I really really love this I love this do you know the people who did this I don't but on their website I think which's really interesting is their influencer program is like at at the bottom and I bet that a lot of their revenue comes from uh I mean if you're like a YouTuber Creator type person like you just want to talk about this you know this is so cool so that's really cool I think they're doing really well and I also I found out about them because I saw their paid ads absolutely everywhere for a long period of time oh I I actually need to get this um purple Game Boy Color with Pikachu on it for myself yeah I just I feel like I'm gonna bankrupt you this this just bankrupted you oh no oh no not again I already spent a lot of money on a Game Boy nostalgic thing today totally yeah but dude this is okay I mean you obviously found the best example uh this is amazing that's exactly what I'm talking about um on the product level so so now that I've seen this I would make a YouTube channel about Halo about era so you I think it's probably best to choose your when when I'm when when you said Niche down if I was thinking about this and I was spending a bit more time on it I would probably choose a platform first and that would be my first channel so I would choose the original Xbox just because I have somehow [ __ ] tons of nostalgia for that even though I had the N64 I had the Dreamcast and I had the Xbox I think the original Xbox was the most influential console to me because of Halo um and and that would be the channel I would create I would focus on the Halo games I'd focus on a lot of the other I mean there wasn't so many other amazing games that came out outside of Halo that I really loved on the Xbox but yeah I would focus in on that I talk about that a lot and I would be an affiliate of this I would be affiliate of grid what do they call grid Studio yeah horrible URL grid Studio CC like I would love to acquire this business Rebrand it add some higher-end uh art pieces to it so their their stuff looks amazing but imagine if it was in you know the frame to me looks kind of Ikea cheap um so but you know I think that there's some collectors that would spend thousands of dollars for some of these and if they were numbered and were there is Rarity associated with it this is a mega mega business uh so I'm really interested in that um have you seen displate d i p a te no so it's kind of similar I mean no it's not similar to that but it has it would be another one of the Affiliates for our new podcast um and actually interestingly enough coincidentally Halo is right up front uh when you land on their display plate.com landing page they are I mean I don't know how much money they're making but a lot of influencers talk about them it's kind of cool interesting man this this is like I want to I want to shut down my business and just work on this now that's my goal is to get people to listen to this and stop what you're doing and go do something that you hear on you hear on this podcast yeah but this the hosts aren't supposed to do it oh yeah because they people need us they [ __ ] it the host yeah but um honestly dude listen we're not going to do it because we don't have time because we're running a well you're running a lot of businesses I'm running one um we someone needs to someone needs to do here I'm going to give someone the exact idea that's going to this will make minimum 1 million per year if you like that area era of video games and you if you have a friend to talk about it or even if you don't so if you don't use Jeff gersman as an as um as an influence so go to YouTube search for Jeff gersman he does a oneman show every week it's three hours long and you talk about nostalgic but not no the thing is people when they talk about nostalgic games they go too far back they're talking about like the original SNES I'm talking about nostalgic for the Millennials I honestly don't know if that exists yet there's L retro is always snz it's always you know original Sega Mega Drive I'm talking about retro for us is Halo it's Metal Gear Solid it's Silent Hill 2 it's Resident Evil Resident Evil and it's you know siphon filter all of this [ __ ] so if you can become the content creator for the new Millennial retro you're going to make yourself a millionaire and you're not trying to make content that's like super you're not like super educational it's Comfort noise you're making comforting episodes that last three hours long you're just chatting about [ __ ] listen to Jeff gersman he's a perfect example of it it's just three hours of chatting and he opens energy drinks and talks about them there's just something deeply satisfying about listening to his podcast and I think this needs to exist for the millennial retro whatever the [ __ ] that's called all right this is big this is big this is a really big idea and it's such it's a big idea because it's a thousand ideas it's not just one idea it's a whole media Empire run by me even though I'm not gonna do it yeah oh man some got someone's got to fun your excessive nostalgic Collectibles habit I know I have so much dude dude I have so much stuff I don't use it I don't use it turn your turn your cost center into a profit Center yeah this thing is great though look how cute this is that is cute I love the colored buttons never going to use it though um so yeah uh that's it that's all I that's all I came here to say I appreciate you having the time thanks for thanks for bringing this to us and if folks liked this episode you have two little things you could do one is you can subscribe on YouTube because we're trying to grow that YouTube as much as possible so go at Greg Eisenberg just go and do it and two comment on the YouTube and we will be in the comments uh the last episode with J cream didn't get as much love is it deserved yeah we we need to know if you if you if you love ja scam or not the best episode to do I mean don't you this this episode's definitely the right it it if you don't like this episode you won't like the vibe so yeah you got to tell us if you like the vibe and if you recognize what I was humming as well earlier yes exactly and thank you for coming on it's been real I'll see you later see you Greg bye bye [Music]

any content that's going viral related to a Creator inventing a new style of making work and sharing it on Tik Tok is a product that could be sold on a monthly basis as a as a box company or in a Marketplace and this is a product you buy that allows you to create content around your purchase and in doing so you're in inadvertently marketing the thing you bought I one theme in my all my stuff is like how do you make it so that your customers share your story and bring you more business organically which is honestly a good prompt for anyone listening for any business it's like pick a business and then be like okay I'm Maddie Mo what is the viral version of this business I I'm trying to cheat to make my life as easy as possible and the viral Loop built into the business is a hell of a cheat [Music] this is going to be a special episode Maddie Mo the most famous artist you don't do that many interviews these days and I feel lucky to have snagged you for for your brain to give us some startup ideas my pleasure to be here it's a long time coming easier to pin you down for a podcast than a dinner in Miami so that is true um but for people who don't know you can you tell them the two or three craziest things that you've done yeah and done is a relative word I mean I operate a large art studio and work with a whole bunch of different people so I've facilitated or helped out with some crazy stuff one that might be of note is uh the changing of the Hollywood Sign to say hollyweed that was done by an artist in my studio uh when California legalized cannabis um a few years back and I painted a block of houses millennial Hank a developer came to me and said that they were having a hard time getting a demolition permits and so they said what could we do that would really uh make a stink so we painted this block of houses Millennial pink thousands of people came to take pictures in front of them and the city ultimately um decided that the houses need to come down which was an interesting urban development project um I taught a famous dog how to paint a portrait of itself um and that that that portrait and video did better than most artists ever do in their entire lives I DED a dragged a duffel bag full of a million dollars in cash a transparent duffel bag full of a million dollars of cashr an art fair built the fuselage of a private jet that allowed take people to take selfies inside of it got credit for all those monoliths that started popping up and most recently have decided I want to build an art town and move to the middle of New Mexico and have been um shipping away at that so what I love about you is you hijack you hijack The Narrative and you do it through ART and that's the lens of our conversation today uh you've got a few cool ideas I just want to jam with you um where should we start well the reason I hijacked the narrative as I started an advertising technology back in like 2008 9 10 when Facebook's uh API was emerging and YouTube and the iPhone were emerging and realized that there were these new centers of attention and there were certain metrics or places that you metrics you can manipulate or places you needed to be seen uh in order to capitalize on those those attention portals or places for attention and um that's where I really hone my skills that I'm now kind of playing out in art um most of my art to date has been me starting with a headline thinking to myself like what headline could I make and then reverse engineering actually actually how to do it which publication to pitch it to how to create enough digital artifacts to tell the story um I've shied away from that and I would say like in 2020 when the pandemic hit I was looking at you and Jack butcher leading these digital communities and realized that was definitely the future um so I I would say that you guys were a big inspiration for that um and started an art community and then realized there was all these ancillary businesses in addition to being a direct consumer artist or a gallery artist um that were fascinating that's supported the entire ecosystem and community and that not a lot of entrepreneurs were building and so I think that's where we're going to start is like think about the world of art as more than just Galleries and artists it's a whole bunch of infrastr between and much of it is being ignored by the powers that be the major institutions because they're set up to sell certain type product to a certain type person for a certain type of result um and that's mostly really expensive product as a store of value and sometimes a way to avoid paying taxes yeah and I'm happy you said that so because a lot of people are are listening to this and they're like art I don't like Art's cool but I'm here because I want to create a cash flowing business and what they don't realize is that you can do both yeah and you can reframe what art means art doesn't have to be a square white cube with some paintings on the walls art can be a way of living like a way of justifying the materials you use the choices you make deeply studying your Craft um I think of myself as more living an artistic lifestyle than portraying the um archetypal artist um and so that's the takeaway is like as a startup entrepreneur you can live your life artfully and that will actually lead to deeper meaning and perhaps better results all right let's dig in bro okay um so we should we talk about these ideas yeah okay I think I think we should start with this idea of a mural agency so it's not a new idea I've already built one I know the ins and outs of it very well um The Challenge I had with scaling was moving to New geographies and so the opportunity lies in indiv individuals realizing that they're in a a tier 2 City a tier three City there's no other mural agency in town and you can effectively Arbitrage uh the cost of of buying a billboard or Arbitrage the cost of generating uh social media uh attention by creating murals for Brands and I'll talk you through how this business works so if you're driving around any City you see Billboards a billboard company bought that infrastructure they put up uh Billboards they manage the placements they manage uh in how much traffic goes to those placements they manage sometimes the creative production and they sell that to advertisers advertisers need that more and more today especially for hyper local advertising or really creative out of home advertising um but the billboard Mafia owns all those placements if you're driving around a city you also will notice a whole bunch of blank walls and those blank walls and the billboard world could be referred to as like Remnant inventory their inventory that hasn't been turned into a billboard placement maybe because it can't be turned into a billboard placement for for practical reasons um but here's the pitch you go to a business owner or building owner and you say hey you got this wall how would you like to make a few hundred extra bucks a month they say wow that's cool never heard of that you sign an agreement with them to be able to manage placements on their wall um you then photograph that wall take dimensional measurements uh package it up you figure out kind of generally what the through traffic is and then you can price it for sale one for the CPM advertising that you can sell comparable to that of a billboard to an Advertiser and two for the artistic creation of the mural so the services associated with that and that can very easily scale to a multi-million dollar business and I'll tell you how hey everyone if you're anything like me you've got a ton of design work that you need websites landing pages emails social assets you name it but you don't just want beautiful landing pages or beautiful websites you want the stuff that's going to convert you want the stuff that's going to actually drive value that's where design scientist.com comes in it's an agency that for one monthly price will do all your design work all your copy work all your engineering and do stuff that actually scales your Revenue you don't need a designer you need a design scientist let's go design scientist.com I liked it so much I invested in the business one billboard placement or or one mural placement let's let's go with mural placement one mural placement can be anywhere from1 to $20,000 in a hight trffic area you get a handful of of of landlords to sign deals with you all of a sudden you control millions of dollars of inventory you go find a killer sales team you go find a few painters and all of a sudden you're just back officing a mural agency okay and you know you say like start a sales team and find painters but how do you actually go and do those things okay so um start a sales team you you have to have some hard skills to be able to do some of these things like you would need to collateralize your offering take photos of the billboard or the the the mural I keep calling it a billboard because that's effectively what it is um take photos of the building measure it figure out the total square footage make a nice little PDF that says this is that build that placement um go online and figure out what the through traffic is based on people driving by add that um extrapolate that number out on a daily basis to a monthly basis come up with a total number of impr Impressions you expect to make um for a particular Advertiser come up with a handful of formats of types of murals you could paint it could be a straight sign which is probably a lower-end production or it could be hyper realistic like photograph and that could be a higher end production and then you uh you go out to advertisers that are advertising on billboards and say hey Billboards get ignored murals are cool for X Y and Z reasons one of those reasons is the process of putting it up draws attention everyone driving by is going to see this thing going up they're going to be have some kind of emotional connection to it as it gets produced eventually they going to drive by it and be like wow the second thing that's kind of cool about these things is people will take a picture of a mural they will not take a picture and share a picture of a billboard so you're going to get organic social Impressions and you're going to get a whole bunch of earned media out of this placement and you get to work with artists and if you pick the right artist you might be able to get them to post on their social feed and tap into their influence and then all of a sudden you have these multiplying effects on a placement that you're already paying for so why wouldn't you work with us and so that's the sales pitch I'm like sold bro um then and your second question was how do you get a team of artists there's a gazillion artists out there that are not making it as full-time artists and in fact to make it as a full-time artist is kind of a curse because you become a like a packaging and shipping and customer service company and you no longer make art um so you've got these artists who would rather paint murals in their free time for an hourly paycheck than work at Starbucks and so you start reaching out to them on Instagram finding out other artists that have painted murals in your your local area and you say how' you like to be part of our mural agency um we'll go find you clients will pay you a flat fee for production you give us your portfolio of work we represent that portfolio work to our clients um if a client chooses you and has some kind of like design phase that they need to go through will make sure you get paid how does that sound go out and get a dozen different mural lists and all of a sudden you have a bunch of different capabilities to sell to these advertisers and from like a revenue and profit perspective how big does this get and how profitable is it I Against I can speak to my business it was a big like high six figure business with a dozen walls in LA and that was not 100% fill rate and that was with a team of like five different painters um that business shuddered during the pandemic when people were no longer buying out of home placements and this whole thing kind of fell on its head on its face but I think there's an opportunity to bring it back um you could probably get 10 grand per wall per month so good sales team um maybe it's a 10% sales fee for anyone that brings you a lead it's 1,200 bucks of the or 10 or 1,000 bucks of the 10 grand um painter maybe pay him, 1500 bucks so you're still at a 75% margin maybe you've got some equipment another 5% you're at 70% margin and then maybe pay the building under 10% th000 bucks a month all of a sudden you've got a 60% margin business and it's just turning out else yeah and I wonder if and you kind of mentioned it tier 2 and tier three cities like I wonder if this is even more interesting in in smaller cities because just no one's doing it right and if you get like a a new local business that comes in they're going to want something cool and splashy and they're probably going to be willing to pay you for a couple months of advertising yeah and you might not get 10 or 15 grand there because the traffic's smaller but the margins probably are bigger there right you just got to figure out how you can get cool artists to small towns but you know I think you can do that I mean cool artists are in small towns and they're waiting to break out and they're very hungry it's just about building the Frameworks around them to actually enable them to earn with their talent totally and it's cool for them because then they can point to like hey I did this mural and it puts them on the map literally another way you can kind of speed up your sales process is um is work with property developers that have tons of buildings and then you can go out with massive scale to a big Advertiser like a Pepsi or Coca-Cola and say hey do you guys want to buy 10 placements across this tier 2 City and do this really cool campaign and then you can charge some kind of crazy like handh holdy Services fee on top of the actual work and placements it's really cool because if you're doing you know a million bucks a city and you're making you know 5 600 Grand per City like could you know could you go to four cities like it's not crazy no and then you become an acquisition Target for a Lamar Billboards or um colossal media um because they need to expand their current efforts which are mostly based in tier one cities there you go all right take it go for it do it do it idea one mty Mo um I like that one you know what I like about that one I like that it's just not complicated it's so easy it's like it's so it has like four or five moving Parts but it's assuming you you get the artist you understand how to sell you're personable uh you iterate with like landlords and and uh property developers like you figure out who what your Niche is and then you pick the right City once you have it set up you got a good thing go yeah if I was in a tier one city I'd be doing that again but uh I'm in a not a tier one city anymore Fair that's why you give it away exactly um we'll go we'll go with this art rentals business and we're we're gonna do three art businesses and then one that's kind of like um close to my heart given the thing I'm doing out in tukum car New Mexico um so art rentals there's this art dealer called Stephan squiz who was referred to by the New York Times as the patron Satan for his art collecting practices and the way he views the art world I think he's a genius and he does a couple things one is he goes to artist and says hey I'll pay for all of your production and your studio and I'll pay you a living wage but all the work you create I get to own and sell and in some cases you get a REV share on and what that does does is it enables him to ma amass a massive inventory of art at a relatively low cost per unit um it also allows him to control the supply of a particular artist's uh like ove or or production um which can influence prices down the line and in some cases when if the artist blows up you've got all this inventory that's super valuable and that's happened to him for a couple times um this other thing that has happened is he's got this Mass massive inventory of Art and he was trying to think about what to do with it and so he started to rent it out to interior decorators and tier one cities um people that kind of like stage homes like 10 20 $50 million do homes in La put really good art up and often times uh the house just gets fought with the art in it if it's well placed and so he liquidates his inventory he's getting a rental fee and he's getting a Services fee to transport the work from his warehouse and install it now that works really good for high-end art in tier one cities but the thinking is if you're in a small town or let's call it a tier 2 City not a small town um and you can go Network in with the art art community I'm willing to bet there's a lot of inventory just sitting around with nothing to do artists make work they don't know how to sell it yet their demand hasn't caught up with their production they're not at their not at where they want to be just yet so you say to them let me consign this work which effectively means let me take the art place it sell it and take a percentage of the sale in order to do that work for you and for many artists that's awesome because they don't want to be sales agents and so if you go and get enough of this work signed up you photograph it you inventory it you build out a database of this work you go talk to interior decorators you go talk to commercial developers we're building big buildings you go talk to Hotel operators and they're willing to lease this work from you and you can charge something like 10% of the sale price with an option to buy it after seven years or 10 years or or whatever or a discount if you buy it after three um you charge a Services fee for an installation so the the the the leasor would likely want to keep the art for a while because they have to pay an installation fee and a deinstallation fee and you effectively create a subscription Revenue model out of this Remnant art inventory you give a r share back to the artists for enabling you to have access to the inventory and you just manage a massive database of artwork sitting in studios I think what's so smart about this idea is when artists think about their assets their pieces of art they think about working with Galleries and I think correct me if I'm wrong galleries take half of the revenue sometimes more sometimes more so a huge percentage now this is kind of flipping it on its head and it's saying forget about the galleries for a second we're actually going to go to this completely new channel that you've never thought of um it's going to be like a completely new almost agent that manages it you and the cool part is there's probably more liquidity in you know condo markets and new home developments and interior design jobs than people walking into an art gallery in your local town and being like that piece looks cool I want to buy it precisely and that's largely requires a reframing of what art is some people think of art as like the most important cultural artifacts of a generation and to be real many artists are not making the most most important cultural artifacts of generation they're making pretty things and what are pretty things decorations so if you're selling decorations and you can realize as an artist you're the maker and of decoration you probably want to sell through the appropriate channels your decorations I wonder what other assets are like this like what are other assets that are just marketed to the wrong channel it's that's a really good question I'm not smart enough to have that answer off the top of my head what do you think I was yeah I I'll give one off the top of my head so hand clothing so there's this big uh you know the last five years let's say shift towards thrifting and buying secondhand clothing and right now you either sell it on Poshmark where you're not getting that much money or you give it away to Goodwill so it's free um I think that there's an opportunity to take secondhand clothing and do deals with retail shops selling clothing I don't quite get how that works I think it's different than art in that well here let me tell you so you go to you go to the store right and the store is a boutique selling men's fashion let's say and you're like I'm G to go put this secondhand currently you don't sell any secondhand stuff I'm gonna go put this secondhand stuff that I've curated from let's say Goodwill or other places and we're going to split the revenue 50% 50% um but I'm also going to charge you a installation fee and a deinstallation fee um so why is this cool because like most of these shops don't have like a secondhand section and they don't want to it's like a whole new channel for them right so it's a similar concept um where and what I love about all these businesses is including your mural one like the startup costs aren't very much money you just have to like do the deal and find the channel yeah so I don't think it's sold in clothing stores per se but it's like a a popup Boutique in a coffee shop or at a bowling alley or something like that where you have a secondhand retail vintage store that pop ups pops up in different locations it's effectively flea market stuff I'll give you another example of one that just came to mind coffee cups should have some kind of thing on them that markets something and when I was in LA I did a lot of the murals and and brand placements for Alfred coffee um through my mural agency they were like a network of walls that we sold through and once a wall got painted then the advertiser would often want to buy the sleeves for all the coffee cups as well so it's like it's taking these services and bringing them to a retail store and adding Revenue to their current infrastructure which is the hard startup cost of getting like a brick and mortar going yeah I like this a lot super easy super easy I also think there's another Trend like on Friday I'm meeting someone for coffee at a at a clothing shop that they're doing a popup coffee shop within the clothing shop so I think you can create I think you can create an agency that is basically a Marketplace of like connecting different retailers with different service providers and different advertisers and just middleman the whole thing agreed so good go do it someone do it how many people actually go do the startups and then email you and be like I did it I did one of these and it worked there's actually been a few people that have emailed me and been like you've changed my life this has been life-changing I heard an idea that you said one year ago I took it and I just sold my company for x amount of dollars or I just hit 1 million in revenue and especially now at the pod's grown so much like it's getting crazier and crazier I love that what a service thanks for doing that Greg I mean to me it's just like selfishly I I'm one of those people and I think you are too like I'm an idea junkie and to me this is therapy like getting out ideas jamming on ideas just to me like this is my time to just it's my guilty pleasure and what I'm learning is that a lot of people are sick like me and and sick like you probably and and and need time to just flesh out ideas because we see the world and it's it's just not perfect right we see the oh what if this happened and what did that happen we're like What if people so I don't even do it fully self-servingly I do it also just for myself it's great I love this concept um should we jump into the next one yeah let's do it okay so this one I don't know that it's a gigantic business but it could be and here's why it could go viral um and so this one is this idea that every day I open Tik Tok and I love TiK ToK by the way it's so fun um every day I open Tik Tok and I see some kind of like new creative method being used by some artist that invented that method and there's a certain number of skilled people that can replicate that method but because they're skilled they're probably going to be doing their own thing but then there's this whole audience of people clicking like and comment ing on these like new viral methods that would probably buy like an art kit and I'll give you an example like there's this guy that does like spin paintings and you just dump paint on a canvas that's spinning you could easily sell that motor and a few components to enable anyone to make a spin painting or there's this other artist that has these spray caps that are unique where he like pipes out a whole bunch of different caps and as you spray it creates this really cool texture that could easily be a product that you sell to everyone that has watched this artist videos and thought of it as really cool now you could do this without permission and just go out and do it because there's no real copyright on the process for the most part or you could go partner with these artists and provide them with a new thing to sell to their growing audience of customers um so viral art kits viral Pottery kits viral spray painting kits like any content that's going viral related to a Creator inventing a new style of making work and sharing it on Tik Tok is a product that could be sold on a monthly basis as a as a box company or in a market place um now there's manufacturing challenges with this one um there's there's it there's a lot more it's probably a harder startup than the first two that we've mentioned cuz you're actually selling a product rather than a service um or a service-based product um but I wanted to kick that one out there and see what your response to that was Greg so check this out I'm gonna share my screen so I met someone who her Instagram handle is Marina minis you see my screen she creates these like miniature versions of things and it started to go really viral cuz people love Mini things and this would be a great example of like an artkit to do small mini things with like instructions on how to do it like she has 263,000 followers on Instagram she's got more on Tik Tok I think um but just crazy engagement right 84,000 likes and this is like relatively new so what I like about this idea is you can actually spend dollars add dollars to to Target people who follow certain accounts so you know that these people like Marina Minis and you can go ahead you don't need their permission right you just buy the ads against it um and yes there's the the TP what I don't like about this idea is the production side but let's just assume you can do that for a second um you start building out this Marketplace of five six seven 8 10 creators and by the way someone should go and register this domain the domain viral artkit dcom is available go it somehow it's available um so unless my producer Rafa goes and registers it you know during listening to this should be available and you grab that and then you just start having like a bunch of these creators you organize it by creators and then it becomes a thing and here's the way to take this from like a small business that's kind of annoying to an interesting big business that has recurring revenue is you just do a monthly drop where you for $50 a month you get a you know you get one of these kits and it's cool because you get to learn about a new Creator a lot of these people are creative in general like that's the reason why they follow these accounts and you're happy because you're getting that recurring Revenue can you find you know 5,000 people to pay you $50 a month or $80 a month for these things like probably yeah and I think the other macro trends that this touches on is it's expensive to live in the world and people are looking for things to do at home that take time that feel rewarding and build confidence people are also a second macr Trend as people are more and more becoming content creators and this is a product you buy that allows you to create content around your purchase and in doing so you're in inadvertently or or kind of kind of proactively marketing the thing you bought so it's a product that has a viral Loop built into it which I I quite like yeah and like you know I'm looking at Google trends for things like 3D puzzles and board games and if you look at it on a um you know let's look at it from a 2004 to present like these are these are some big Peaks you know people are they want IRL things that they can touch and do and and you're right like when going out for a drink and a cocktail cost you $18 or something like do you know you might not want to do that right because a night out might cost a100 $200 you might just want to stay in and create content with with your boys or your girls so um I do think that's it is a trend and and uh I like this this is a sneaky good idea dude I'm not going to do it someone else should do it someone's goingon to do all these all all these ideas can't wait um okay the last one which I think is kind of cool so since we last saw each other which has been years I moved to this small town I built an art residency on this Ranch um I've been kind of like getting involved in the local politics of this town um joining various organizations related to economic development in this town trying to figure out is there a way to use creative creatives and culture to revitalize economies of small towns given that there's this almost death spiral happening in big cities they're becoming unlivable they're becoming expensive people are now able to work remotely some in some cases and so is there this idea that you can take old infrastructure in small towns and create like little Utopias especially given that the major Maj of the population most these small towns are retired age and on their way to the end of their life all of this infrastructure is going to become available for sale largely because the kids of these retirees don't want to move back to these small towns because quality of life isn't there so I'm trying to figure out if I can like Kickstart a small town and my thesis started with an art residency and that was cool but what I really needed is people to be able to come to the small town spend some time enjoy nature have an affordable experience and have something to take a lot of pictures of so I bought 40 acres I turned it into a glamping site I brought in a whole bunch of big huge selfie friendly sculptures and created what I'm calling Art City and it's this concept that could be a franchise that I take to other koas or or koas and start to acquire koas through private Equity it's a a business that I could just scale myself and have 10 art cities around the country it could just like a really nice cash flow business for myself I think my guiding principle with anything I take action on is that I have to be able to do it faster than anyone else so I can iterate and make it happen quickly also it has to pencil into 25% Roi no matter what or else it's kind of like a UNG growable business um so came up with this idea glamping site 40 acres Sculpture Park off- rout 66 20,000 people drive by every single day because of our proximity to Ione 40 which is a major thoroughfare land is Affordable um it it just seems to work one thing that I had to do in order to stimulate demand for my glamp ground was sign up for hip Camp which is like Airbnb for camping and if you go look at the hip camp map there's quite a lot of cool spots but they're for the most part very much clustered around certain geographies but the thing about camper is they're often on road trips and they're crossing the country and there's areas or pockets of the country that have no hip camp sites available and why is that well in order to have an appropriate hip camp site you need to have shower facilities and toilet facilities and perhaps like a fire pit and some infrastructure for these people to camp on whether they're in a tent or a van so here's the idea go do a little bit of data analysis on hip Camp figure out where major thorough far are where people are leaving big cities heading to another location go to that town in between write a letter to a property owner and say hey I'd like to do a joint venture with you where I'm going to invest in bringing in like a composting toilet and an outdoor shower and I'm going to manage your listing on hip camp and I want a revenue share against the revenue generated and just like folks built these Airbnb Empires I suspect you could do this with hip camp and I think the macro Trend here is that for many people that are traveling airbnbs are too expensive and they want perhaps a more organic um kind of a little bit more uh in the woodsy feel experience and there's already a platform that does most of the heavy lifting and finding these customers for you so I want to comment on one quick thing I think on the air on Airbnb what I noticed it is there's a bunch of people that don't even own airbnbs they're going to people who have Apartments they call it lease Arbitrage so they're going to people have Apartments my my friend Blake roacha talks about this a lot online he he basically you know will go to this building and say listen I'm not going to buy your building but if I find you a tenant at this rate like is that cool or if I manage your Airbnb at this rate you know can I get a cut so I think this is kind of that same thing but in a different vertical that no one's thinking about literally no one and the other thing that's happening with campers and Van lifers is they're mostly content creators and so this has this other built-in viral loop I one theme in my all my stuff is like how do you make it so that your customers share your story and bring you more business or organically and so this this particular category of accommodations does does satisfy that condition that most of your customers are going to market the thing for you after they've experienced it once totally I like it the challenge is like how do you find the perfect like composting toilet outdoor shower combo that comes on like a a semi and you Fork off and drop down and it just like Works um because most people are not going to want to plug into their septic or their sewer they're going to want something self- sustaining um this might require some Capital to actually get started um those are some of the challenges I see in building out this business how much Capital realistically does it take to get going though well like a really like I bought a really nice composting toilet from my site and it was like 14 Grand for a two-seater um but this is like the the top of the line um you could probably do like an outdoor shower and a composting toilet for closer to a grand or two grand or something like that so let's say you get 40 bucks a night per camper you've got a 50% fill rate that's six grand a month um I think that's six grand a month 44 no 600 bucks a month um you could could probably break even within the year and then you own the infrastructure and you keep doing that my math was way off I'm not that dumb we swear he's not that dumb yeah just okay so when the when the editor goes in I'm not that dumb exactly yeah yeah um so those are some of the ideas I had I mean I'm really into what Cody Sanchez was talking about related to like roll up of services businesses in small towns and operationalizing them I'm seeing that as a need here in this town but I'm not a subject matter expert on that and I'll probably end up doing it here and two carry um but yeah that's those are the those the big ideas for today Greg three fire ideas four fire ideas actually three in a bonus uh which we appreciate and I like all of them because anyone can do it it doesn't take a lot of capital they're all with vir ity built in uh because you know the problem I think with a lot of businesses is you just it's hard to find customer so you know if it's built in that makes your life a lot easier and uh so I appreciate you man and where uh where could folks learn about art city and you uh visit art city.com is uh where you can find uh day passes to Art City learn about the artists involved um book overnight STS and the most famous artist.com is where you can see all my work yeah and if uh if you're cruising through tukum Cary DM me on Instagram at theost famous artist and I'll show you around and otherwise uh my email is Maddie thefamous artist.com and I'm I'm open to hearing about people starting these businesses and having tremendous success with them and like what does Art City look like in 20 years like where do you want to take this thing have you heard of Marfa Texas yes okay so Marva Texas was this military town and kind of in the middle of nowhere West Texas um Donald Jud moved there with the help of this Rich lawyer guy bought up a bunch of infrastructure built his Studio brought his friends out there and Mara's real estate 10x in the last decade or so um that's an example of how art can kind of impact an economy I would like to have a tremend this measurable impact on tuken carry and pro that like investing in art is a good thing um because it drives the economy um I could see a world wherein I partner with largescale property developers and become like the creative director of their entire portfolio given the relationships I've got with these large scale sculpture artists and the understanding of installing and selling this stuff um ideally whole bunch of knowledge workers and artists and creatives moved to tukum carry and entirely new industry is born and I'm not sure what that looks like um I imagine Art City and its current instantiation will be some kind of Fran franchise business or a roll up of a whole bunch of different campsites that I turn into art cities and then like a acquisition by a publicly traded glamping gr glamp site or trailer park operator or something like that because what I'm building is the viral version of a camp site or the viral version of a trailer park yeah which is honestly a good prompt for anyone listening for any business it's like pick a business and then be like okay I'm Maddie Mo what is the viral version of this business it's just a good prompt yeah it used to be start with the headline because headlines used to be a method through which you could go viral and then the news media just got all wacky and it was no longer that interesting and then everyone became a Creator so how do you Empower people to create content because they've used your product right and so what is it it's a video is that you know reverse engineer the video the video of what I mean it's just I I feel like all social platforms are now 60% video right Instagram Tik Tok even Twitter now is like a video platform LinkedIn just added video YouTube like video is the atomic unit now of social so reverse enging reverse engineering someone being like hey I'm at you know Art City check this out yeah and some kind of interactive component that's like memeable like a meme is just a repeated Behavior how do you allow people to repeat a behavior over and over again that elicits positive reactions from the people they're sharing it with cuz that's all that's fueling this virality is like people are going look I did this cool thing please accept me and then they accept you by giving you likes and comments on the cool thing you did totally yeah exactly and I think your goal as the business owner is you know if you've got 100,000 unique visitors visiting or watching or seeing your brand how do you get the highest percentage of that 100,000 call it 20,000 30,000 to actually create a meme or create content um so that that brings in another 100,000 and then you build a flywheel yeah and I wouldn't say I figured it out yet nor do I have like as ambitious aspir as as ambitious of aspirations as you Greg I don't need to be like the guy who owns a portfolio of businesses till the end of time like literally all I want to do is wake up and like water the plants in my garden and go for a walk and like hang out with cool people and I've arrived at that place in my life and so I I'm trying to cheat to make my life as easy as possible and the viral Loop built into the business is a hell of a cheat yeah but you're looking yeah you're looking for I think all entrepreneurs are looking for shortcuts and it's just in our nature that's the best shortcut that we have is if if you if you can solve customer acquisition and solve word of mouth I think you've got a pretty good CH code and the cool thing is yes like okay you don't want to build a huge portfolio of things you know maybe I buy that maybe I don't but I will say that you've built something that could like when people ask me oh I want to build a holding company how do I do it I always say start with one thing so you you're building one thing that has this viral coefficient built in and the beauty about that one thing is it could be scaled to different regions if you wanted you know if you wanted different regions different re Revenue channels like I could see Art City becoming a kith likee brand where we do collaborations with really high-end other brands or I could see Art City becoming like an artist rep representation company where we're selling large scale sculptures for a whole bunch of artists that we don't actually have sculptures on site with um or have their sculptures on our actual property um I could imagine becoming a festival company um there's just yeah H finding a shelling point and having it be extensible I think that's what you're doing quite well Greg well I think what what you're doing and what I'm doing and what I think everyone should do if you're interested in being an entrepreneur is you're putting yourself at the middle of something that really interest you and that gives you optionality to you're like you're you're the center of gravity when it comes to you know art and this local art so you have these sculptures you're meeting artists um and then once you're once you're at the center of it even if it's local Center um doesn't need to be Global then you have this optionality around okay I can go do this thing I can go do that thing totally yeah optionality is important I get bored easily it's also more fun dude it's way more fun to to to be to have that optionality to to do different things as you evolve as like a human being yeah and one thing I've seen you preaching lately or for a while now is like the lack of Need for venture capital and building these types of businesses and I think that's totally true but as someone that's raised venture capital for I want to say like six or seven different startups that process and that going through that structure has helped me think more clearly about how to operate my own own businesses now and so it it's not that Ventures good or bad it's another path and perhaps exploring it is a good way to get punched in the face a few times and learn exactly what you don't like doing yourself so that when you start your holding company uh you've got some some strong Foundation to stand on well I think what's good about Venture and you know yes we've both done it is a you get rejected hundreds or if not thousands of times so the process of getting rejected is just good for any entrepreneur because it allows you to you're pitching all these VCS and a bunch of them are just the timing isn't right you know the the metrics need to be higher oh we have a a conflict right so you're getting you're getting all these insights and it does force you to like put all your thoughts in this deck that ultimately at the end is this potent way of explaining whatever it is you you do and that's really really awesome I feel like so that's number you know that's a and b I feel like someone should just create like the YC but at the end there's no Venture investment it's like a program designed to just help entrepreneurs and accelerate them and meet other entrepreneurs so I think the VC ecosystem does put you in the room with a lot of other VC entrepreneurs and that's that makes you high quality yeah so uh when next time I come to Miami can we go for a meal we can go for a meal also I'll be in Montreal for mural Fest in a few weeks which is a I just Googled it 1.15 million people go to this event that uh they decide it's a nonprofit and they basically take over like 100 mural and they do all kinds of cool murals and people go and visit it and you should check it out little R&D yeah I'm I'm uh locked in here uh making sure that my summer is very uh profitable um but maybe next year I'll check that out cool mie Mo it's been real catch you later thanks bud thank you [Music] baby

like what makes this business really great for other people who want to create uh businesses with tiny teams is number one you lock people into an ecosystem number two the customer service is just exceptional number three family business number four it's niche it's not for everyone and they went after like the Tony Robbins of the world and then last but not least it's a dope name [Music] so there's something different about us today we are wearing suits why are we wearing suits Greg we are wearing suits today because we are introducing a new award for the industry the entrepreneurial small business business bootstrap industry and what's that award that award is the tiny team award and what does that mean it's an award we're going to give out maybe once per month maybe once per quarter who knows maybe once per lifetime maybe once per lifetime so like zero consistency at all listen audience don't expect any consistency here it's an award we're going to give out to a company that has a a team of less than 10 people but that is very special it's like a company where you you've maybe used their product or you've maybe seen their product around but you didn't really know that it was just a tiny little team behind it so it's a tiny team doing something big and special um that you may or may not know about they're they're like flying under the radar that kind of thing you know you think they're bigger than they are but they're smaller yes yes exactly you think they're going to be bigger than they are but then it turns out you think it's like a 100 people but then it turns out to be two people yeah and and it blows your mind and you just you can't believe it you're like what how's that even possible yeah and it's super cool as well because they're often like family-owned businesses or like it's a couple or it's like a brother and sister or it's like two high school friends um and I just think that's like a nice heartwarming kind of story as well or just lovers just some lovers just lovers yeah it could just be just lovers you know that's it we just keep it like that all right let's dig in all right so the first tiny team award for the startup ideas podcast 2024 goes to King flip chart yay okay but I don't know I don't know what I don't know that business at all good good good good okay so King flip chart if you go to any Alex Heros video um if you've ever seen like videos of Tony Robbins on stage if you've ever seen any basically any public speaker using a flip chart on a stage this flip chart if you look closer has a little stamp on the bottom right hand side and it says King and this is because they are using a company called King flip chart which literally is two people doing one thing and that is they make the world's biggest flip chart okay and a flip chart flip chart meaning one of those things uh where you're just like kind of like a whiteboard it's like literally like a a stand with really big pieces of paper on it that you can write on and then just turn them over the next piece of paper a flip chart and and how well do you think these guys are doing honestly I don't know and I've reached out to them to see if there's any way I can like get that answer I don't know the answer to that question but the flip charts are very expensive and literally every single person in the personal development space is using them look at any Alex Hermos video uh where he's like every second Alex Heros video he's standing in front of two two of these flip charts and the paper refills which are specific to these flip charts cost $100 for one paper refill and we're a tiny company like my company's very small and we're using like four to five of these paper paper refills per month so anybody who buys one of these flip charts is using that paper and essentially paying a monthly subscription to keep doing their events and using these flip charts and they do pens so I'm looking right now they charge uh for the the king flip chart exclusive set it's 1315 plus taxes and that in that includes um the foldable and portable flip chart I think it probably includes uh a few refills and stuff like that but I didn't realize it would be that expensive yeah it's it's expensive because it's like completely custom made and the weird thing about it is so I started seeing this flip chart on stage and the exact same thing happened to me I was like oh man I need a flip chart that size and so so I started looking for a large flip chart and eventually I was like what like looking at all these different flip chart companies and like most companies are not like Standalone flip chart companies they do all sorts of other things and eventually I went back to the video that I was watching and again I think it was like I think it was Alex Heros or Russell Brunson or someone like that and I zoomed in and I was like King what is King and I figured out it's a twers company working out of Italy and it's a sales and marketing expert uh and a like a Furniture designer I think uh working together they're I believe a couple and they are the people who personally respond to you when you message them on the website so we had like an emergency two weeks ago because we were running an event at our office and we ran out of the flip chart paper and they're like no problem we'll like expedite it to you and it's just so nice to have this as like the most personalized experience ever and I just love I love the Simplicity of it it's like we make a flip chart what else do you do nothing the end I also I also recommend people go to when you go to their website if you go to the team of King flip chart and we we'll put this on the YouTube video it's just a picture of um T Zana and Sandro just like looking deep into your soul yes and it's it's perfect and they just talk about like you you start reading the about the team and you really get a sense of like who these people are why they why they're doing what they're doing it just feels so family business and I feel like the trend around like the Amazon modification of the internet this is like the anti-trend around just like this feels like you want to support this business quick ad break let me tell you about a business I invested in it's called boring marketing.com so a few years ago I met this group of people that were some of the best SEO experts in the world they were behind getting some of the biggest companies found on Google and the secret sauce is they've got a set of technology and AI that could help you outrank your competition so for my own businesses I wanted that I didn't want to have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I didn't want to depend on ads to drive customers to my businesses I wanted to rank high in Google that's why I like SEO and that's why I use boring marketing.com and that's why I invested in it they're so confident in their approach that they offer a 30-day Sprint with 100% money back guarantee who does that nowadays so check it out highly recommend boring marketing.com absolutely and that's exactly what I do as well like for me once you buy one king flip chart first of all you're locked into the ecosystem right you can't find you you'd have to Custom Design uh or have a company custom design that paper size for you because it's humongous but the other thing is I just want to keep supporting them they're so nice it's just such a humble uh like tisana is the person who we talk to um when when we are when we need new stuff um and honestly one of my biggest challenges right now coming up in the summer is when I'm traveling around and I don't have my king because I don't want to bring it onto the plane what I'm going to have to do is literally buy a new one and have it shipped to the location that I go to and so I'm like super locked into the king universe and they're just such a tiny company I just I just love it it's they deserve this tiny team award which we need to make a little logo for so they can put on their site they deserve this prestigious very prestigious award hey we're wearing tuxedos here that's right exactly so congratulations uh I know you've been you've been wanting this uh from the day you've been born t t tana and Sandro so congratulations and just from like a uh framework perspective I'm trying to think so like what makes this business really great for other people who want to create uh businesses with tiny teams is number one you lock you lock people into an ecosystem number two the customer service is just exceptional yes number three family business number four it's niche it's not for everyone and they went after like the Tony Robbins of the world so then you look it in you're like I want to be a king too you know I don't I want to be a king Tony Robbins is a king and then last but not least it's a dope name King flip chart King flip chart it's so it's just what I love about it is they've so you can buy flip charts from anywhere right you can go just Google flip charts and I'm sure there's a million of them on Amazon but they've locked themselves into this world of like direct response marketing and personal development where they basically now and and all of the testimonials on their website I'm sure way more people have think flip charts but they are focusing on the people in the personal development space and it just keeps it keep yeah it's it's like a niche within a niche because it's not just that it's we're just doing flip charts it's we're just doing flip charts for the personal development onstage space which is just so cool it's a flip chart that's big enough to be on stage that's what I think is so unbelievably specific and about it and it like what are like theal station style things where you think that 3M has already cornered the market so 3M is the company that makes posted and all of these other things like where and I actually have one of the 3M flip charts here it's hidden in the background here but this thing is like pretty expensive as well but King flipchart came along and was like What if it's the biggest though you know yep I love it I love it I'm I I just love it I love it so that's award number one I I've got a tiny team award I want to give out all right I'll lift it up again so for the second tiny team award ever to be given sip to that uh stardew Valley oh my God what a [ __ ] great I don't know if you want to beat that up but what a we didn't know which ones we were going to bring to each other that is such a great one do you know about the story of stardew Valley I know about the story of story of stardew Valley and I have it on here and have way too many hours on it so stardew Valley is a farming game started by a guy by the name of Eric not sure how to pronounce it Eric Baron or Eric Baron I don't know if he's ital you know maybe it's just the Italian flip chart got to me so it's the flip chart family again it's the son of the flip chart it's a it's the son of the flip chart Dynasty yes so for for the purpose of this award we're gonna call him Eric Baron he's the oneman developer behind $300 million of earnings of stardo Valley so stardo Valley started um I think he started building it in 2011 so it took a while it took a few years but basically it's this farming game um and he was the sole developer for the game and Not only was he the sole developer he was the sole designer he even crafted the music for the game that not many people know that and it was this really cool concept where you know so many games the trends were first-person shooters uh MMOs uh killing people fighting games he did the complete opposite and uh created this like calming farming game and he what I love about the whole story uh besides that he's a tiny team and he did it I mean amazing that he create you know created $300 million of value by himself is the fact that well he just basically went against all best practices and all Trends and just said like this is going to be a really cool game I want to go and put this out here and you know people said that it should be $60 he started charging $15 and you can even get stardy Valley now for as cheap as $4.99 so his his you know I just I love people who have a POV and is just like this needs to exist plus I'm a tiny team chef's kiss so congratulations Eric bar beron very very good one very very good one okay so you know before the episode we didn't discuss how many awards we're giving out uh so I'm gonna give out another Award right now uh another tiny team award staying in the video game Space uh I don't know if you've heard of the magazine called a profound waste of time have you heard of it no I have not ah ah I'm very happy to hear that so in the video game space there is a magazine called a profound waste of time uh the guy who does it is a guy called Caspian Whistler and Caspian whis Whistler is the person who not only is like figuring putting putting together this entire magazine and finding all the artists and um figuring out how to get all the interviews in there he's also the person who personally is messaging you when your magazine is like stuck in delivery um and was personally messaging my girlfriend back and forth over Christmas when she was trying to get me the three issues of the magazine um super high quality really amazing interviews from really crazy uh video game developers in there really like uh high-end video game developers uh like the for example the developers who created IO and uh Shadow of the Colossus really I I don't know if you can see if you go to the website a p.com like it's just ludicrously high quality for one person to go in and actually take on a project of this size it's ridiculously ambitious as well similar to stardew Valley the amount of effort that goes into a project like this and I think what's what this and stard do Valley have in common what the two people who worked on these have in common is that this is absolutely a labor of love where you never know if this is actually going to turn into a viable way of making money but it's almost like an obsession that you that that these people go down and actually start working on these things so my my third my my personal second but our third tiny team award is going to the a profound waste of time video game magazine uh and how they do each Episode by the way how they how they fund each issue is by uh doing a Kickstarter for every issue so that's also kind of cool so they don't just bring out an issue it get every every single issue gets funded through Kickstarter which is kind of cool this is this is beautiful I'm obsessed with this the covers like the cover art is just absolutely stunning it's like one of those things where you want to buy it and just like frame it and put it on your walls it's it's absolutely amazing and it's actually one per customer so it says due to demand is not possible to order multiple of the same item in one transaction action uh so I just love like the scarcity of it too um it does feel like very Community oriented like this is this is a really really good one I wonder how much revenue they're bringing in for something like this yeah you can see on the kickstarter Pages how much each uh Edition makes so there's some transparency around that but a lot of the all of the past issues that I bought were not through Kickstarter so those would be included uh so I guess you could check the kickstarter Pages um like for example there was 100 if we look here to Issue 4 or issue yeah I don't know actually okay it doesn't even matter it it doesn't matter cu the impact that this is making it's so cool it's so cool this is so cool it's so cool yeah this is too cool this is too cool they're interviewing like the members of the Portal 2 Team theater of Silent Hill come on come on shoe in this is yeah it's too much I have them all around my apartment I bought every or my girlfriend got them to me as a gift but they are so unbelievably beautiful I love them so much all right that a good one than all right I got I got one I got I got another one when are we stopping like is is it just like we're stopping when when it feels like we should stop yeah exactly I'm like [ __ ] I'm waiting for you to run out of ideas and run out of one so that I don't have to have another one you know you're talking to the wrong guy oh man yeah all right so my second tiny team award goes to AJ the founder of card c a r r d are you familiar with card no I'm looking it up right now so if you go to C rrd Co it's basically these simple free fully responsive onepage sites for pretty much anything so uh card is I I got to know AJ through Ryan Hoover from product hunt so he launched on product hunt he was just like I just need a way to create a onepage card onepage website in a really simple way and I think other people probably want that he launched on product hunt it went viral within that Community all of a sudden as a Onan developer he's doing I think at least a million a million and a half of ARR wow and and and you know the cost with something like that I mean not very much um and what ended up happening is a lot of causes um like social causes uh started using it and a lot of for whatever reason um like K-Pop Stars started using it so it's just like cool because number one it's cool because he's a tiny team it's him and I think one other person it's cool because it got popular like he didn't really do any marketing it kind of just like blew up from the product T community and then spread to it you know communities that needed it most I think the black lives matter community used it a lot and that spread to other causes and then K-pop Star started using it and that spread to other people who uh listen to K-pop and I just thought I just thought it was cool that it's just some developer who created um a one page I think website Builders are just cool too like it's one of those categories where it's like people have been building website Builders since the 90s it's like do we need another website builder I guess we do that's what I was that's what I'm thinking about it's interesting probably you see this with your audience I definitely see it with my tiny audience is that when if I would post something like this you'd have one or two idiots in the comments being like Oh So pointless we don't need another one of these things and the point that you should be when you're when you see something like this something like card what I am thinking is what the hell how can you make something like this differentiated when there's a million different like one page I don't know there's a million different ways to make websites uh also for a very low price so I'm like my gut reaction is to be like why would you need another one of these but actually the correct way to think about this is how is this actually working and this is I'm super curious about this because it absolutely does not appeal to me at all on first glance but like why do you think this works so firstly go on to to Twitter and just put in card and search and sort by latest what you'll see is like every second people are tweeting about their their card websites and I think one of the reason why this works is it's a status symbol within certain communities to have a card oh yeah so it'll say like like when you create a card it'll be it'll be Greg Eisenberg doc. Co and within certain communities like I mentioned K-pop and and causes it just it's kind of like a flex but why like how did that how did that happen was it an accident or was it cultivated I don't I I I I honestly think that it was organically cultivated like it was it wasn't like AJ you know I think he lives in like rural Tennessee so I don't think he has the most amount of K-pop connections yeah you know um so it just from that product hunt launch I don't know it just sort of spread and they they they they saw the product and and it and it felt cool and interesting and they like the name in the best way possible when I'm looking at these card Pages it reminds me of geoc cities was it called Geo cities or geoc cities um it reminds me of that sort of retro like if you look at we talk a lot about anti-trends it's like the anti-trend of Squarespace Squarespace is all about like high quality everything's aligned perfectly the templates are beautiful whereas this has this more rugged homemade geoc cities Vibe I wonder if that sort of retro energy is what also makes it work so well I also think that their business model is one of the reasons why it work so most people most website Builders will charge 10 20 30 sometimes $50 a month uh for access to it guess what car charge is uh zero no not not that tiny well it says it says uh on the landing page that it's a simple free fully responsive one-page site oh actually you're right it is free like you can create for free but if you want like uh if you want the pro features like a c you know uh multiple sites no branding widgets embeds Google analytics forms like if you want to connect it to beehive or convert kit something like that you do have to pay for the advanced features and it's only yes only $19 per year that's that's pretty very affordable yeah I mean that's what is that it's less than $2 a month um $9 that's like one coffee you know it's it's a tiny amount of dollars per year yeah $19 that's like an espresso you know $19 is like half an espresso yeah $19 that's like a water isn't it yeah yeah I'm happy you started talking about that because the comment section is going to be like so upset and people people are so get so upset about the prices of things but at but $19 is like the price it's only the price of like a small glass of water it's like for for Dan water it's about $19 you know I I think what we should do you know people don't watch every podcast I think what we should cultivate on this podcast is a sense of being really out of touch with the rest of society and when we see something like um oh the the Apple Vision Pro is only $3,800 like price of a coffee totally don't like don't say it's a joke and just keep doing that until people think we're viciously out of touch totally I like this I I like that a lot yeah I mean $3,800 to be completely disconnected from reality and for the price of a coffee it's a no-brainer yeah dude I like coffee what does that it cost approximately I mean I'm sure it's within the ballpark of $3,800 right right yeah it's in the ballpark right with with tip it's around $3800 [Laughter] hey does your audience know both of does your audience think we're both fully wearing a tuxedo or do you want where do they think it ends yeah I mean I I think they know where well are you wearing what are you wearing underneath there I don't know we just have to think about it you're gonna have to guess in the comments you have to guess in the comments I mean I was thinking about putting on pants but then I was just like what is the point yeah can you see this ghostly [ __ ] happening behind me yeah what is happening behind there like your I hope your editor does like one of those crash zooms whenever that happens like stuff's just moving around in the background Wow that's scary okay you did you just give your tiny business award yes to card yes I give the tiny business award to card.co congrats I love that I have another one all right we'll go will we do another one I'll do one last one okay I'll do one last one so I think there's a an area we haven't gone into yet and it's patreon businesses uh like really small uh patreon businesses and I want to give an award to a patreon business and again like maybe this person wouldn't like it to be called a patreon business because it's uh he's a really amazing artist but I want to give an award to Bobby fingers uh if you go to YouTube and search Bobby fingers uh my favorite video the best video I've ever seen on the Internet is called Jeff Bezos rowing boat if you watch this whole thing and don't think it's the best YouTube video you've ever seen something's horribly wrong with you and you're a bad person so Bobby fingers has a patreon account a patreon account what I love about his patreon and what he does in particular is that he's not like a person who's constantly putting out different uh he's he's not constantly pumping out content he puts out like one video every couple of months you have no indication of when it's about to come out and then this video is literally him making a diarama do you know what a diarama is no so it's it's kind of hard it's like a it's like something happens in real life so for example um what's the guy's name in his most recent one Fabio so there's this I think singer called Fabio and he was on a roller coaster and he he got hit by a bird in the face um or got hit in the face by a bird whichever way you say that around and there's like footage of that there's footage of him coming down from the roller coaster with a bloody nose and he's really pissed off and this guy Bobby fingers he makes like a little model of that moment uh like a moment in time but like a physical model like a sculpture of the moment his videos are like the making of these little sculptures or in the case of the Jeff Bezos thing he makes a boat which is Jeff bezos's face but a massive working boat and literally the strangest most kind of confusing videos I've seen on the internet the most like painstaking work like we're looking you're talking about a 30 minute video of the making of this Goose uh this diarama of a goose hitting this guy in the face and just like the journeys he goes on while he's making this diarama and the weird things that he's saying while he's creating it and this is like for me a business that could have never existed outside of patreon existing and I think patreon really allows for single person teams or one or two person teams to monetize just their weirdness and I love that and I think it's super cool I don't know how big Bobby finger team is um I cannot imagine it's more than 10 people but he gets another tiny team award from me in the content category let's add in categories now wow you went there I can't believe you went there yeah content art category wow nich yeah yeah exactly very very Niche so Bobby fingers honestly guys if if you only get one thing from this uh from from this episode please and also something weird is happening I know this is not really interesting for the episode but I pay for his um patreon but like I can't use it I don't know what's what's happening here so something's patreon if you're listening to this uh tell me tell me what's up with that uh with that issue there by the way like an exam another example who I'm not going to give the tiny team award for but one of the runners up have you seen nice dad's channel yes I have I love that yeah I love it I love that people now can take their weird little hobbies and if they're just consistent enough and just focused enough and willing to sort of push through this initial phase where just no one knows you you can literally replace your job by showing a 30-minute video of you making a boat uh that's in the shape of Jeff bezos's face and uh you never have to work for someone else again I love that so good how cool is that that is so good that is so cool so cool that fires me up what did you say that fires me up yeah like you could quit whatever I mean you don't already have a job you're kind of like creating your own jobs but like if we just did this award ceremony every week and it's like $10 a week to listen to I'm just kidding that wouldn't be totally and we make a magazine out of it yes yes um imagine how little money we would make and how annoyed how annoyed we would be all right I'm gonna refrain from one uping you with another tiny team award I think dud no I can't I can't I want I want you to have the last word on this one and we'll do another one of these yeah um here listen think what you should do is maybe someone on your team should make a not shitty looking version one of these and like we send it to the to the people who want it as like a hute thing totally or we just send them that post it you know that we just you know even so here it is here you go yeah but I think uh it would be uh if if you guys do this um please let me know if you get responses I think this could make some people's day or maybe they don't give a [ __ ] maybe they're like who are you losers how are you how dare you call yeah my team tiny yeah exactly I'm 6 foot three okay I'm huge do you know how large my flip chart is yeah all right well JC this has been fun uh thank you and uh any any parting words um I'm so sweaty yeah the thing with suits is it really traps in the Heat and there's no uh air conditioning in Germany like in most German I'm in a new building like a new apartment and there's still no air conditioning being built into apartments and like I'm just sludge yeah well they say higher quality of life in Europe but no AC I don't know hard hard hard to uh hard to deal with that one Greg we need to do an episode just this is a preview for what I think we should do as as an episode in the future Europe versus the US when it comes to entrepreneurship yeah biggest episode ever totally did you see my tweet to to Daniel e yes it's very uh I I I I have a lot to say about that topic and um have you had Peter levels on this podcast yet no he's like really hard to track down we get we got to get him we got we're okay we're going to do here here's live canvas strategy you and me are going to do an episode on Europe versus the US entrepreneurship we're going to talk about Peter level's um European accelerationism uh which is one of his his new kind of movement and his merch and uh Peter will just have to he'll just have to come on you know yeah he'll have no choice but to come on Peter yeah come on come on Peter yeah all right man dude it's been it's been real I'll catch you later thanks everyone bye bye [Music]

this is a perfect first company to for anybody to start so it's Google ads for XYZ and then you create an agency that's around that specific thing it's going to be like shooting fish in a barrel all of these com companies or people are searching for Google ads for XYZ and if you go to the front page of Google what's ranking for the majority of the pages at the top is a snack pack of three YouTube videos so if you just name the video Google ads for apartments and you walk through literally how do you set up Google ads for apartment complex and you're just going deep on like the strategy the tactics the philosophy of this for a lot of people they're going to look at this and be like oh my God like I don't want to do this like this looks mind-numbing so I'm going to go and I'm going to buy the service from a person and then basically you know get 30 clients and that's a million dollar a year business like I'm obsessed with this right now as like YouTube as the top of funnel for service businesses some kid who's 24 can go do this tomorrow and I guarantee you if you did a video a day for the next 200 days you could easily be at 30 grand a month doing [Music] this dude what is this a week later so I guess it later so we recorded most viewed pod most downloaded pod since the beginning and I've had everyone from Alexis Ohanian on here J you know Jason Cal canis David fredberg Morgan how sah Bloom you name it but I don't know there's something about you you're an idea machine that people couldn't get enough of you I love it man I'm stoked to be back we got a lot more I think we I've got eight in the chamber but two are software one's a Creator business and the other ones are all like service companies but anyways I totally Juiced the numbers by the way I was like just running Twitter ads I just I wanted the top spot on the Greg uh the Greg YouTube channel so and you did and it worked so thank you let's let's start with service businesses because they're easy to start and I want you just to bang through all these service business ideas because some of them are really good cool um should I start with the Creator one or go to the service one whatever you want you can start with whatever you want but what's what's important to me is that for every idea that you talk about just being giving people the tactics around like here's the idea and this is how i' actually go about starting yeah exactly cool yeah no I'm down all right let's rip all right so idea one uh I want to start with this the local only marketing agent Agency for XYZ rich person service category so let's break that down um so I did some Consulting this is years ago for a CrossFit gym their uh customer lifetime value was like $1,700 if I remember remember right um and we could get people in the door for like 50 bucks and so for them it was basically just like this like money printer uh all we were doing is it was Instagram ads to people that were like had a CrossFit interest that were in that area with like a certain income bracket so on Facebook you can actually Target people that have um like you know they're the top 1% of a uh of income earners within a geographical area and then you can combine that with an audience audience interest targeting so for CrossFit but this same idea could be applied for like any type of business that's servicing these type of people so think CrossFit uh think um like estheticians uh you could do this with probably like tattoo removal my whole strategy to go and build this list would be just like you can scrape all of these people's email addresses from their websites by using a service like hunter.io um so the whole strategy is you go and you scrape Google Maps uh go to Fiverr right now search uh Google Max Google Maps scraping and uh you'll find somebody that's built out like a whole proxy server Network that you can pay them you know $100 and they'll go scrape like a 100,000 listings for you on Google Maps you give them a Target keyword phrase they're going to find every one of these uh companies so say you're doing it for like CrossFit Gyms and why we're talking about like a specific category is that for once you figure out the marketing strategy to grow that business you can use that exact same stack that same marketing stack to like get people in the door so for them what we did is we had an ebook download that was like uh you know how to gain muscle fast or something you know just something like that basically we'd basically send them to this free eBook download that would turn them into uh or that would put them in an email nurture campaign and then we grew like their Instagram account by doing Instagram ads uh with like a call to action to follow that account to get more like fitbo or something if I remember correctly but so once you have that whole marketing stack you can just do that over and over again and this is actually how you create like a great product High Service Company that is focusing on a specific vertical uh so like again to walk through the whole acquisition of new customers you go and you scrape uh all of Google MK for all of these companies their emails will be public because most of them put them on their website so hunter. will find those you can also use a tool called Phantom Buster Phantom Buster will go and it will scrape the entire website and it will reject any email that is publicly like visible on that website all those emails you then take and you use an email validation tool uh the one I like right now is called zero bounce uh once you get those emails validated then you can start doing cold email buy like you know 20 different domains that's probably all you would need for this you can do two uh two inboxes per domain that you have use a software like instantly uh use Microsoft their admin or Microsoft 365 to make all of the inboxes so you'll have 40 inboxes in total you can send 40 uh emails per inbox and so so on a daily basis uh you'll be or sorry on a monthly basis you'll be able to send 32,000 cold emails uh to that list uh so like with Crossfit gems if I remember right and again this is a couple years ago so don't quote me on this it's probably different numbers but when I initially was looking at doing this there was like 25,000 of them that I could find with contact information and I mean you could hit all of them within a quarter basically uh is the is the idea and if you can't sell that many of them uh that's you have a problem but this you to talk about this it like when it gets scaled up like these uh marketing agencies that are for specific vertical there's this company that nobody's ever heard of it's called Suds creative the only reason I know about it is because I dated this girl who worked at this company and she uh all they do is uh for car washes they are basically the marketing agency that does like all the marketing for basically every car wash that's in the United States and it is the same stack of stuff that they do they do coupons and then they get people onto the subscriptions and it turns into this recurring Revenue thing quick ad break let me tell you about a business I invested in it's called boring marketing.com so a few years ago I met this group of people that were some of the best SEO experts in the world they were behind getting some of the biggest companies found on Google The Secret Sauce is they've got a set of technology and AI that could help you outrank your competition so for my own businesses I wanted that I didn't want to have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I didn't want to depend on ads to drive customers to my businesses I wanted to rank high in Google that's why I like SEO and that's why I use boring marketing.com and that's why I invested in it they're so confident in their approach that they offer a 30-day Sprint with 100% money back guarantee who does that nowadays so check it out highly recommend boring marketing.com but if you look on Zoom info it says they do like 12 million a year I know from Insider information it it's like 5x that and all they do are marketing car washes for car washes and their acquisition strategy is literally exactly what I just talked about so I think this is like a huge play for it's an it's an operations game is what it comes down to but now with these AI tools I mean you could basically like build this whole stack out and build automations and it's like cool like you onboard a client and it just like zero to1 all their Google ads Facebook ads you know built a a a a PDF eBook download for them like that whole whole thing could be standardized and turn into a process and like where I was doing it previously with like offshore team members you could do this with probably like one person with a stack of these tools behind them like all you would need as account reps and then if they had a little bit of digital marketing knowledge or you just get like a whole Army of offshore Talent that's like focusing on each of the verticals so somebody that's focusing on only Google ads somebody that's only focusing on Facebook ads and then they know that're they playing and they're just op optimizing for each of those so uh yeah I don't know if that's the the one that the one I'm most excited about we're going to get to in a second so but yeah anyway just wanted to lay that out there for people so what I like about this one is it's local and I think a lot of people they think software they think Services I want to go everywhere and I think you brought up cars which is really interesting I heard a story of a company that is a marketing agency for uh car dealerships in Quebec and dude these these websites that they're building like look like they're from 1997 they're terrible man terrible and the business is doing $20 million a year just marketing agency for like they've got like you know a 100 clients and uh they retain their clients right because totally yeah they totally retain their clients and this is just Quebec so it's it's just which is a market of 7 eight n million people right so I think um CrossFit for insert GE geography right it doesn't always have to be the United States too there's other markets out there thousand per. I think the thing that people don't realize with this too is there's a learning effect when you get that many clients that are all in the same category as well so like first off you're not competing with people that are very sophisticated like tomorrow a week ago and we could like optimize a Google my business listing and we could get it to Page you know into the snack pack Within 72 hours right with just like super simple SEO stuff it's like are the keywords in the description of the business is this completed are there photo like this is things these are things that are like basic standards when it comes to when you're playing at a global scale right but on this local scale this is super easy to do and also the people that they're typically interacting with that are providing these services within their geographies are really bad at this so the competition that you have is like you know this random dude that all he does is WordPress development oh we also do SEO and we do all this paid ad stuff but in reality like all he's doing is putting a skin over you know like a WordPress we like website block Builder and then upselling all of these services and so when you come in with that expertise that's just focusing on that digital marketing component and then layer all these things together and have the learning effects that are happening from the knowledge that you gain from servicing all these clients within the same industry you create this mope for yourself where it's just like you're you're going to be so much more comp and and the thing with these types of Industries is they all know each other like a great example of this all the gym owners know each other because they're all in the same forums and they go to all the same events and so you get this natural just I mean I we got I think at one point I was the max I ever got to was I think it was doing four gyms um at the peak of it but all of it was just referral base right like I wasn't doing any big it was just Consulting work so I think to you know to reiterate like there's there there's just so many positive things here and like it the challenge is operations like how do you because a lot of them they want FaceTime like you and so it's like on a weekly basis like you need a 30 minute like call with them that you're having that conversation and then how do you supplement that like you can use Loom and maybe you put them in a slack Channel or you know or like some type of community where they can talk to other members there's ways that you could do this but I think that the challenge that you know and this is when I was just starting my career was like I don't know how I'm going to scale this out outside of myself like I could go get 10 clients right but like now how do I take that to 100 how do I take that to a thousand it just needs a good operator to do that a couple quick tips for people so one is if you are targeting non-english-speaking countries like don't do cold emails in English sounds obvious but you know if you're sending emails to Germany like it should be in German shouldn't be in English if you're sending emails in to France it should be in French um the second thing is uh use Loom like don't just send characters in an email and you know I'm sure some people are going to be like well I don't speak German um so how am I going to supposed to go on loom well that's where you can use 11 labs and some of these other tools just use AI to basically you know create create it and uh I'm sure you've got some ideas there but you know I'm just seeing looms within emails convert just so much more than just straight up text totally agree I totally agree I think something that I've seen be really successful lately is like just show the growth graphs so like we're building this new agency and like this is all I'm sending is it's like here's this graph that goes up and to the right and then I have a sequence of like four emails that are just graphs up and to the right and do you want to take a call and works pretty well when you just like show don't tell right it's that same idea so uh I think with the video thing too we're seeing this just be like the biggest leverage point to for Founders to create and it's really like it's like one to many sales right like I can do this single video and like that's what marketing marketing is traditionally like people talk about marketing and it's like they're like build Brand Build brand it's like no like really what you're doing is you're like selling people on an idea at scale so rather is one to one it's one to many and that's like the really the biggest differentiator between sales and marketing like I when you think about it uh different than that you're actually not doing your job well in my opinion unless you're like a you know you're trying to differentiate a commodity brand like Coca-Cola or something like that then the rules kind of change the biology of it changes but yeah I think uh I think that this one is like a especially if you're young like if you're 22 and like how do I get my first you know 10K a month so that I can be the most balling balling person out of anybody I know at College like this is the this is the business that would I I would start tomorrow if I had to start from zero right it's one of these types of things this this is like 2024's version of college painting 100% a thousand perc I mean you could do this in a bunch of different categories too like you could do this you know it doesn't have to just be cold email as well like you it could be uh you know do Instagram DMs like wherever they spend time online that's how you get in contact with them right restaurants it's like a lot of Facebook still so it's just like okay just DM them on Facebook like figure out that whatever that channel is and I mean half the time you can just like cold Callum as well too and this is the scariest thing for people but and like it's such a volume game like you start to get numb to it I think that that's the other thing with all this like when it comes to any cold Outreach you you get numb to like with enough reps you just quit like it's like water on the back of a duck right it just like flows right off of you when somebody gets pissed off that you reached out to them because there's a certain percentage of these people that they they're going to look at this and they're gonna be like cool like I pay you a grand a month and that turns into 15 grand new revenue for me like from a customer lifetime value point of course I'm gonna buy that right I'm gonna go and buy that all day long and you could probably do a version of this where it's on a like a fee or sorry it's basically um based off of like the per it's like it's Performance Marketing right so we come in it's whatever I convert I get a percentage of that um in my experience that just really depends on the small business but a lot of them and also like I would focus on these things like again things that rich people are buying in your neighborhood right like th not not like HVAC not like any of this those are super competitive those service businesses they're also like not a great repeat purchase like something that you happens where it's like on a weekly or a monthly basis like think about Pilates think about bar classes think about you know these types of of companies where it's like I'm going in and I'm buying that thing regularly those are going to be the most uh effective places for you to create a bunch of inbound for them that's super high valuable and it's not like oh I have to you know with hbac it's like this is just a lead gen game right because like how often does your hbac system go out but in contrast it's it's there's a often a longer customer lifetime value especially with these services that are you know focused on higher demographic people uh in in geography I'll give one idea that comes top of mind to this so pools so you can you you know go find where the highest per capital amount of pools are private pools which cost like 50 to 100 Grand if you want to you know real pool and a try to sell them on a pool and then you just sell that lead to whoever ends up making it um B you can also sell them on um uh upkeep of their pool so you know for like 200 bucks a month we'll send someone who kind of like tests the water and makes it all good um so I think that's you know an easy opportunity and then you can also go to places where it's cold where people have hot tubs so think about like mountain towns like you know don't and and that's the thing The Prompt here for people is don't go to the the obvious HVAC stuff stuff you know that's obvious what are the nonobvious spaces to go into totally and again I would like look at like CrossFit estheticians pool cleaning companies tattoo removal like any of these things that are like high ticket that would be recurring for even tattoo removal probably isn't a good one because it's like okay there's an end to that right you want something that there's no end to it like if you own a pool it's going to live on in perpetuity right like that's the type of companies where this is the most uh interesting place to like start these businesses also just as a side note there's this local SEO play that you can do it's called like Rank and rent right you probably know about this for the audience this idea is basically you like create all of these websites that are geography uh optimized to rank four spec specific keywords like pool cleaning XYZ and I'll give you two examples of this so window cleaning is one of them it's a Rec regular recurring thing I met this guy when I was dirt bagging I was in uh redfish at redfish Lake in Stanley Idaho and he was living out of a van and he ran his company off of a laptop with a starlink and he was doing 180 Grand a month and he owned all these websites all over the US he started out as doing a window washing company in like San Diego Then scaled this up to this thing and I I mean I I was one of the crazy you know it's just like him right that's that's the entire company and all he's doing is selling leads to like other window washers and then another one um so a friend is uh in the space of like selling uh like Yachts like like yacht cruises so it's like you you s like rent yacht you know uh Florida or Miami or whatever right uh owns sites that rank for that huge ticket item and then sells those leads and it was literally just like had a phone number up that that that person would call so again these are like little things that I think for like the if you're deep in Internet you know business culture like I've been here 15 plus years I've probably tried every one of these at some point within my career they're they're like obvious things but for I think a lot of people like they don't even realize that this is happening in the shadows like behind all you know every Google search that you're doing there's somebody that's like me that's a degenerate that's ranking a website that's trying to get your contact contact information so that I can sell it to another company what's your next idea so next idea I want to talk about the uh service business that is reach out for uh influencer marketing so this is a large Trend that's happening within software especially like B to uh SMB software where you basically like have to create trust and teach people how to use the software at scale and so uh this actually really kind of came from I was working or doing some Consulting for a friend's company I was doing some SEO work but their whole strategy for growing their entire like company and it's one of these uh things that's like a multi-million dollar company that you've never heard of before that's in a category that I'll probably never talk about because it's just so so much value um but the uh what it does is uh basically their hold to growth strategy was focusing on just doing YouTube videos so basically influencer reach out to YouTubers to have them talk about their product and show how to use this product and then they have an affiliate place so the structure of this is you basically would go and you'd make some type of affiliate commission for your software so 30% recurring as an example and then you would go and you'd work with these influencers and say hey I'm going to pay you $500 for this video and then you'll also get all these recurring commissions out of this so he did this like himself in the beginning to just scale this up where he reached out to like 300 different youtubers found all their emails went and commented on their videos did this whole thing absolutely massive time suck right but he was in early stage of this Founders ship so he had time and he had resources now he's at scale and he's like I can't do this anymore and you can't it's hard to hire a person to do this and so this is where this idea comes from so it's basically done for you influencer marketing as a service so how you would actually go and do this is you would go and you would find any like software that's being built so like think of a you know instantly think of any of these like companies that are uh building in public right any of these tools that uh PE I mean and there's there's there's th hundreds of thousands of them like just go on Twitter and you'll find somebody Hawking something like you could do this with swell and a harpy so the strategy then is okay I'm going to go and I'm going to find these software companies I'm then going to say hey I'll do unlimited influencer Outreach for you to these people that make YouTube videos to these YouTube influencers and how you actually do that is YouTube actually will show you the email address of a YouTuber but if you so if you go to the about section of a channel it's going to show you an email so those emails um they are uh behind a capture so what again go to Fiverr like there's ways you could do this like yourself but the easiest way is go to Fiverr search uh YouTube uh uh L uh YouTube or sorry YouTube link building or I think it's uh YouTube lead generation something like that they'll basically go and scrape all of these YouTube channels for you find all the emails that are associated and then you can cold email all of these people again use just a cold email software and then you're basically just turning into a service company but the idea is you go and you broker all of these uh Rel relationships and all of these deals uh and charge you know two to 3K a month to do this for the company so for them they' probably give you a budget so you know using my friend's company they would give say hey we have uh 50k this month to spend on influencer uh work so go find me the best uh people to work with so you and go and you email 500 people and then uh that turns into a certain amount of leads the the kicker in how you can do this to be really effective is you then take all the people and you look look at their different subscribers and view counts and the cost and then you create a ratio of what those are to each other and then you can compare okay to see oh in this bell curve of people this subset is actually underpricing themsel so let's go with that subset and invest our Capital there and that's how you can create a greater Roi for your client so at that point you're like okay we just did a 100 videos and then you would go and you look at the affiliate commissions from all the people that you just did create a report for them and then show okay these people are the ones that created the most impact to our Revenue here's you know our Roi basically our Raz count uh we're going to reinvest all the capital back into these people and then we're going to cycle in a new group and so for him where it gets to now is like he has 30 core influencers that he works with that he knows they're GNA is going to generate x amount of Revenue per month but the KnockOn effect that happens here and this is how I would sell it to them is that once you get enough influencers talking about your product in this category then you'll start to see that up incoming influencers that are trying to build within that space will also review that product for you for free without paying them all they're doing is trying to play do the affiliate game of get that 30% commission right so there's like this growth flywheel that gets built in this you know I always talk about this like digital gravity like this is a way to build digital Mass but it's digital mass in relationship to attracting it like Affiliates and as you get more Affiliates in more Affiliates copy them and as more Affiliates copy them you get more Affiliates in and so it creates this like virtuous flywheel but this is is something that I know like every founder that I talk to that's in the influencer space is like I or sorry in the software space I there's all trying to figure this out how to do this they don't have time to do this they don't know how to set this up and like what I just said just lays out that whole process and you could 100% capitalize on this like I've talked to like five friends already and like is this something that would be interesting to you and they're like yes 100% I would do this tomorrow for like two grand a month if it was just handled and I didn't have to think about it and I just got a report on a weekly in a monthly basis of what was happening yeah I think I think what pisses people off about working with influencer agencies is they're not most of them are not really conversion rate focused or row as focused they're kind of just like give me some money and I'll get you some influencers and that's the trade so if you can position this as like Revenue focused and and just basically that whole story and you you you on the website you tell like the founder story that and you're you you tell the story of like I was once one of those people I spent a million dollars a month and I was generating ,000 dollar of sales and you know Mr Beast even reviewed my Prof you know my product and it sucked like some story like that I mean of course it has to be true um but some story with a Founder letter similar to how Jason Fred has like really good founder letters like if you check once.com or any of his stuff he just he has a really good way of just talking about the bigger picture and then once you learn about once you scroll down and you read the founder letter you're like wow yes I have spent a bunch of money on influences and has gone nowhere so I think this idea plus founder letter has legs 100% And then it the inbound that you all you'd have to do was just a YouTube channel for this like I'm obsessed with this right now as like YouTube is the top of funnel for service businesses is like going viral in the SEO Community right now with like Julian Goldie and Jackie Chow um Cho I I'm not sure he jack he owns index he's ripping right now but all of them are basically doing the same strategy where it's like daily videos talking about whatever like basically it's just doing experiments in public like that's what it's coming down to like here's all the experiments I'm running here's what we learned here's what worked and here's what didn't and their channels are just exploding right because of that daily posting that's happen Happ but what that turns into is all this inbound leads because you become an expert within that category so if you just talked about like yo here's all the influencer marketing that we're doing for all our clients make all the data Anonymous and just show graphs that are going up and to the right of their affiliate commissions that are like you know their affiliate revenues that are being paid out you could easily like build this thing I think that could be a part of this top of funnel I'd probably pair those two things together so do the cold email component cold DM and then pair this with like YouTube on top of it and I think that that's going to become a standard I also the the Segway is Into The Creator business so maybe we go there next and talk about this Google ads for XYZ thing because I think this will be also like another like you're trying to start your first company this is a perfect first company to for anybody to start so yeah let's get in there and and just on the Jackie Chu chw side of things like I know a lot of people are listening to this and they're like I'm not starting a YouTube channel and and I was I was actually one of those people who like hated YouTube up until recently but if you go to Jackie chws YouTube like homie is not producing his his stuff very you know super professionally it's a loom video with a good mic and like his iPhone that and he's like he calls in from whatever hotel room he's at at that point it could be like two in the morning his hair is like disheveled like it's all good yes 100% because the content like and it doesn't matter like his videos maybe get 2,000 views right but if 1% of those people of those 2,000 views turn into a paying customer and his basee fee is like five grand for you know link building a month that's five that's $100,000 in new customer Revenue like that's the game that you're playing here and I think this is a larger Trend like you I think you're seeing this but like long form content is how you actually convince people to buy things that are expensive uh Neil Patel just dropped this data I I think it was like two or three weeks ago but they basically looked at like what produces more revenues for a company uh that's in the B2B space or any type of service business and they were looking at YouTube short or they were looking at short form content versus long form content and like 10 10x more impactful was long form content and it makes sense right like also Alex Orosi just switched to this like if you go look at all of his videos he just switched from like 10 to you know 15 minute videos and now they're all like an hour plus okay why is that happening so I was talking to my friend Brian and uh NG he's uh his company's called viral bangers he writes he writes scripts for YouTubers that that are made to go viral and basically what he's talking about is like they're adopting what was traditionally called like a virtual sales letter so what uh what's that company called that yeah I can't think of the website it was like one of the original like sell digital products on it's Russell brunson's company know what I'm talking about yeah clickfunnels okay so it's that idea but for some reason that's cycling again back into the Zeitgeist of people's mind which is hilarious it's like all of these like 18-year-olds are discovering this now for the first time and I'm like oh yeah I just turned 32 weekends ago this is why this is happening because the 10e cycle here but what I'm getting into is that this is long form content is how you build like a super deep amount of trust with people to be able to sell those higher ticket items and this is again perfect segue into this next business I want to talk about so it's Google ads for XYZ and the so if you go and you look for uh the all the longtail keywords that are and when I say Google ads for excise e think Google ads for apartments Google ads for car dealerships Google ads for whatever that ends up being so all of these com companies or people are searching for Google ads for XYZ you can if you go and you look at the front page of Google for every one of those longtail keyword phrases and Greg I'll send you over this list so that your the audience can get it we'll drop it we'll just put it in a Google sheet that anybody can go see and copy because I want I want like 30 I tomorrow like 30 30 people to go and just start these YouTube channels and this is all they do because you could own this so easily so you make Google ads for XYZ and if you go to the front page of Google what's ranking at the majority for the majority of the pages at the top is a snack pack of three YouTube videos so if you just name the video Google ads for apartments and you walk through literally how do you set up Google ads for an apartment complex that's trying to get like inbound leads to get people to apply for the apartment you're going to like get views but the bigger thing is that you can rank on Google for that high value keyword phrase that would be almost nearly impossible to rank for if you're trying to do it from an SEO standpoint so the monetization strategy is pretty straightforward you build if there's a thousand different keywords that you can go after build as many videos around each of those as you can so make a thousand videos then you're going to get ad revenue from that to begin with because the watch time is probably going to be long so they're going to be at least 20 to 30 minute tutorial videos talking through all the components of these things what I would then do is you upsell some type of tool that has an affiliate commission that's super high value so a great example of this is going to be something like super metrics so supermetrics is this company that nobody knows about as well it's like one of these other ones it's a data pipeline tool to be able to get ads data and really only like marketing agencies use this but it gets ads data from like Facebook ads gole Google ads search console you know any data source that you would try to get data into and you can pipe that into spreadsheets you can pipe it pipe it into looker Studio you can pipe it into um like a business intelligence tool like Tableau Etc and the crazy part with this is like some of the price like some of the monthly pricing for some of their highest tiers is like two grand a month right so it's like an Enterprise level software basically but incorporate hey you want to see like you want to compare your Facebook ads or your Google ads like against each other in this specific way well you're going to need this tool supermetrics if you go to the link below you can get access to it blah blah blah right so then you get an affiliate commission there's another like there's so many ways that you could pepper in all of these other softwares that are secondary or you know tertiary related to this core Google ads thing that you're doing but the long-term play is then this creates inbound leads for an agency that you create and you just have it be an unlimited Google ads agency right but if you they just watched a video that's 30 minutes long long have you setting up this thing and you're just going deep on like how like all the like the strategy the tactics the philosophy of this that's going to be like for a lot of people they're going to look at this and be like oh my God like I don't want to do this like this looks mind-numbing so I'm going to go and I'm gonna buy the service from a person and then just again one of these where it's like charge three grand a month you do unlimited Google ads and uh basically you know get 30 clients and that's a million dollar a year business but some kid who's 24 can go do this tomorrow easily and I guarantee you if you did a video a day for the next 200 days you could easily be at 30 grand a month doing this and like from all of the revenue streams that we just talked about right there and I think okay taking a step back putting a framework to what you just just said so if you do want to start an agency that's what you want to do for whatever reason and I think it's a good place for a lot of people to start step one is you create videos every single day in your Niche and you make it look sweaty like Jackie it's all good and sweaty like us 100% step two is you just sign up to a few affiliate offers you get anywhere between 20 and 40% people don't realize how much some of these SAS products are willing to give um and sometimes it's even lifetime deals uh for example you know we host a lot of our communities on school and school which is actually Heros one of Heros and S oven's business we get 40% of Lifetime revenue of the $99 a month that people pay for it so that's step two and the outcome of step two is it subsidizes your customer acquisition cost so it puts you into a zero to negative CAC situation where you can go ahead and take some of that money and put it into ads to get more of your of your uh CER your target yeah your ICP whatever yeah and I think this negative CAC thing is super interesting because you're you're basically I'm seeing all the AI writers do this right now there's like a million AI writers that are being created by these Founders on Twitter and every one of them like if they're you know worth their weight and salt all of them are doing this exact same thing it's like go to YouTube and it's daily videos how to use like an AI writer to create SEO content that ranks right and then that turns into this like viral funnel for them they get paid off of all that because there's ad and and I think what people don't realize is that like if somebody's searching Google ads for XYZ that's a super high value impression that's going to be bid on a lot right so like MailChimp will pay a hell of a ton of money to be in front of that person because there signaling they're trying to do digital marketing activities so there's these categories that traditionally like ads are way more expensive in finance is one digital advertising or digital marketing is one you could go down the list I travel is another one so if you're doing these types of videos like your your your RPM is going to be so high automatically just because you're in that the watch time the dwell time is going to be super high because it's a tutorial and then also that down funnel movement is going to be super high because it's a like you look if if it's your first time looking at a Google ads dashboard it is mind-numbing like nobody knows how to actually use it effectively like there's very few people that are super good at it and so if you are like become you know become an expert in this and for the people out there that're like okay how do I teach myself these things go to YouTube and go to like loves data or go to uh there's this guy named Julian I think it's like Metric school or something like that if you just look up like Google data Studio tutorials and Google ads Google data Studio tutorials you're going to find these people that in public like create some of the best like tutorial content you you've ever seen and all of those another great website is called analytics Mania and they are uh basically like here's how to set up the analytics infrastructure for your website so you can actually do this tracking Etc but in 30 days over a summer if you sat down and every day you just watched five hours of YouTube videos and played with this thing you could 100% get get to that place then you just start making videos about everything that you learn during that process and that's going to create this like top of funnel to then allow you to create this this agency over the long term but that same Playbook can be used in so many places I think this is the thing that like for I want to uh go back to what you're said like talking about the framework component like this could be done for Facebook ads right like Facebook ads for churches Facebook ads for ecommer Facebook ads for lawyers like there's so many of these same searches you could do that exact same thing you could also do it like Google Maps for truckers like I'm looking at these right now Google Maps for boers Google Maps for RVs like all of these different uh categories that you could go after all these specific marketing tactics that people are trying to do if you just become an authority in that and then you create an agency that's around that specific thing I I mean all day you're just it's going to be like shooting fish in a barrel yeah and it doesn't cost really anything to get started and the videos actually make you pretty accountable to actually learn and be good cuz you're not going to be doing tutorials on you know dashboards Google analytics dashboards if you don't actually know what you're talking about so it forces people to get from not good to good at at the skill set totally totally all right we've been ripping uh should we do a should we do a software it's time for software all right this one I'm like I'm geeking over and I want I wanted I want it so bad but I'm going to just give it to people um so there's 4,000 keywords for XYZ QuickBooks Integrations this is insane okay so again I'll add this list I'll give it we'll we'll put it in the show notes of the show you can go down you can you can download it um so what this is basically is people are trying to get data from other tools into QuickBooks and really it's the accountant of that person that's trying to get this data from you know this real estate data in from this other tool into uh QuickBooks and when you look so we analyzed the data for these and we found that about 50% of them 40 to 50% of them didn't have Integrations that already existed so of those 4,000 keywords there were not Integrations that were on QuickBooks already there wasn't like an app on the QuickBook app store for that specific integration so let's just talk through like all the bi like the biology of this business because I think it's like Madness QuickBooks huge company so you can eat you know their scraps and still make a massive business here they have an app store but there's not a ton of developer developer activity within that App Store so there's a ton of Arbitrage that you can capitalize on now when you look at the actual software that you're going to be building you're just doing a handshake it's just a data transfer from one software it's an API call from one place into another place you don't even have to store that that data you're just moving it back and forth between these platforms and when it goes about the marketing strategy all you would have to do is Google ads focusing on those longtail keywords to those landing pages and then you make all of these longtail landing pages that are like and here I'll read off some of the examples uh once I find them but basically you could just do SEO and sem and that would be the entire growth strategy for this because it's so it's so high intent that you're going like if that person is like if there's no other integration in that space like they're going to choose that solution because the only other option is they have to do this manually and so there's no way that the accountant is going to do that so here I'll give you some of these QuickBooks Integrations as an example of like all these different softwares that are built on top of this that like people are actively searching for and again there's tons of these that aren't uh built so clickup QuickBooks integration uh tal uh tallic QuickBook integration Builder Trend QuickBook integration app folio QuickBook integration I mean the list goes on we'll add this below but from a software standpoint super easy build I mean you could build this probably with an offshore team in all reality and then that just turns into a marketing game that you're doing it's like okay how do I basically get the DAT and you'd have to be I I guess you'd have to build some Metric of trust so like as the founder I'd build like some type of public Persona as well that they could go and see oh this is like a real person because you're touching all of this like business uh like Enterprise business data but I think this is like a I think this probably a $30 million a year company I 100% think that just based off of the search volume based off of how many users of Quick Books there are and based off of how many people aren't building these Integrations for this category like just go on QuickBooks the app and like sech like their App Store and search some of these like these integration names like for example like search netw Suite search Builder Trend search Clover search ramp like all of these different ones and you're going to find that like a large percentage of them there isn't an integration that's even shown within the App Store that you can just go and create and they're also like very low competition keywords because there's nobody else in this category going after it so dude do you know how many apps there are in the QuickBooks App Store I guess how many I have no idea how many take take a guess for cont for context Shopify has 13,000 okay 300 750 apps oh my god dude and and half of them don't even have any reviews so there's basically like 80 70 apps that people use it's a gold mine also you could probably sell this with cold Outreach to accountants as well like hey we build custom Integrations for data into QuickBooks right and just like cold email every one of them in the US say it's like offered as a solution but the kicker is like hey you build this custom integration and then you go and you sell it to everybody else right so you get paid Upfront for that development cost that's actually probably the the way to do this without having any operating Capital costs so 29 million users of QuickBooks and you know how many users Shopify has how many 4.6 million users oh my God which is a which is a whole other framework for thinking about when you want to create software in one of these app ecosystems look at how many apps are in the in the ecosystem versus how many users and just go to where great data set I would love to do that data set with you is find marketplaces and we do like a public thing where it's like okay here's all I would be super cool I'd be super down I'd be happy to like put some you know team behind it or something so yeah amazing uh should we do next one yeah let's let's keep going okay cool all right so next one is Tik Tock SEO as a service for like fine dining and cocktail bars so I saw this data like three weeks ago or four weeks ago that was talking about how gen Z isn't even using Google to start searches for local search it's like only happening on social like they go to ig or they go to Tik Tok and they search like you know X you know bars Denver or whatever right or um nlife XYZ location and so it got me thinking about like okay most most of these companies like especially if they're old traditionals like I'm thinking like pizzerias and stuff like that like there there's no way they're have any strategy for this and so like I think you could go to them and be like okay we're going to rank for blah blah blah location you know whatever keywords are high value to them and then all it is is it's just like you as a Creator and you're just making like ugc content that's like the five best pizzerias in you know whatever neighborhood of whatever City right and then you just start with whoever your clients is and you just run down through those and I think that you could super quickly like acquire a customer base because the the thing that we're seeing is that with this type of SEO you can almost refresh it on a monthly basis and it still has as much much impact as it did on day uh 30 days before so in contrast to traditional SEO it's like oh I'm going to make this investment you know month one and then maybe 12 months later I start to feel the impact of what I did in that you know it's a long long-term inest M with a longer term time Horizon in contrast when I'm looking at these socials like and we're actually seeing this with like long former longer form video as well so if you're on uh YouTube as an example and you're doing like a 10-minute video that's some like focusing on a you know bottom of funnel keyword that's related to your company you can probably do that same keyword like every 30 days 30 to 60 days you could just come and do another video based uh you know almost exactly the same that's running through that as long as you're doing enough content like again I'm talking about like you're doing Daily Posts or weekly posts or something like that but I mean I think that you could probably go and sell these companies like Grand to two grand a month and get these you know get clients that are on this local scale to do this I you could probably do it more especially if you go for that higher Echelon that's why I said like cocktail bars or like listening bars and you know fine dining so these places that are traditionally like they have a higher like income uh earner that go to those locations if you can show them that like hey I can regularly get in front of these people and give suggestions of where to go there's also probably a media play here too where it's like okay you make all these pages that are scattered all over the US and they're for all you know each of these locations you basically like go and you make these videos for all of those places and then I I think that there's something like th this feels like people haven't figured it out yet and it's such it's a massive Arbitrage for like you're you're watching these local businesses that are these um experiential businesses go viral on these these apps and the thing that happens is when one viral moment happens here and this is like how you could probably sell the company you get this knock on effect that happens where all of these other creators they start to include you in that because they saw that that video went viral where you went viral in and so it creates this like you know larger flywheel that spins rather than just the search volume that happens from that thing but again if you can rank for you know best pizzeria Uptown Denver or whatever right like you're probably going to create inbound that happens from that especially from that younger generation if you're trying to get in front of them and this is the only way that you're going to be able to get in front of them like all searches are going to go towards this this is where it's starting this is where Discovery is starting from a person's marketing Journey now yeah I think the the move is to create a set of accounts per City so you do like cool spots Denver I also think so that's step one step two then is probably a mix of using other people who've gone viral in that City and being like I'll give you a hundred bucks if you review this other place and getting them to cross promote on their their personal page and you know and the the the your new page and you'd be surprised like a lot of these people don't have that many followers and like 100 200 bucks is like oh wow that's amazing you're going to send me this cocktail bar and you're going to promote promote me on that page is amazing um and then you just build up a bunch of these accounts that are essentially like Yelp for these different cities and then once you have that then you probably you know you probably everything goes back to email then you probably figure out a way how can I get these people build this email list it's a top of funnel probably not email because it's gen Z probably text so like have you Leo yet no tell me about it okay uh startup uh I think they're at La I met the founder uh uh through draft horse actually we we was helping them with this their SEO strategy uh they basically they're they're called a drop CRM so it's like email list SMS and Instagram and all three of those things you can like promote something through at the same time so it's going it's this is becoming like the standard in the music industry space right now is like this is the tool that you use if you want to basically like do good marketing and I think that you could probably use something like this so it's like you could even just grow that IG account and like Tik Tok will come to this as time goes on like all of them will come to this as time goes on the reason that you can't do it with Tik Tok right now is like something to do with like bulk uh bulk uh messaging Instagram has a different privacy policy or different policies where if the person messages you first you can respond back to them at scale so how lelow functions is basically you put on your story or a post like reply with XY exactly DM me with XYZ keyword and then there's an auto uh like response back that occurs for that but I think it's probably something like that that you could do that and I'm just imagining like all so to think about the actual tactical components of this you would make these videos that are like top five spots for XYZ whatever these keywords are that are related that you know would be high value you make these like I mean it's just coming back to like BuzzFeed listicles I think what you said is really interesting though because like this will replace Yelp like nobody trusts yel and nobody trusts Google maps I mean I go to like Reddit right now to like go find the top places like this actually is probably how I'd do it I'd go and I would go I would look at Reddit like Top Mexican places in XYZ place and then I'd be like here's the top Mexican places in XYZ place that you've never heard of before rattle them off and then that account would grow on you do that on Instagram reals do that daily and then you would go and layer on paid ads spend on top of that so you can do paid ads um I think I talked about this last episode but just for the people that didn't hear it before what you do is you basically do Instagram only ads with a call to action in the description to follow XYZ account for more content like this so when it's an Instagram only ad that at is technically a hyperlink so when it shows up as the ad to the person they can actually click into that which takes them to the profile and then you can build basically a follow funnel that happens through that whole process so what we've seen before is like we've gotten like 30 to 50 Cent followers for that but every person that touches that profile you can put them into a remarketing audience and that remarketing audience can then uh you can basically show that content to them over and over again so it builds a brand within that space right but you could do that for every one of these places in the US and then that would grow the actual Channel use something like a Lelo and then uh like you go to a company and you're like yo I've got an Instagram of 20,000 or whatever like we do you want to do a promotion it costs X you give me some type of thing and then you just lay out how it function lelow handles the whole thing and then you're basically you just turn into like a marketing like like you know as a service for these for these Brands and then I would probably put them on like some type of subscription like how do you get a payout where it's like you know you're it's a it's a contract where it's quarterly or by quarter you know you know two quarters or whatever that ends up being and then you promise XYZ amount of like a post a week every Thursday you know or whatever date that they're trying to be more uh like get more foot traffic you have you have something that goes out each of those days to get more people in the door give me one last idea I know I know we're pushing on time by need it I know I got you this what I just said actually like goes right into this next one um so I do a little bit of work in the music industry out of Nashville specifically uh so I my friend his name is Colby Aku um we grew up together we were honestly just like drinking buddies like specifically him and my brother and then I got involved but I would go to the like bar at you know 7 a.m. and they would have been there all night just doing pull tabs like gambling people don't know what pull tabs are it's literally like you buy like a whole raft of pull tabs and you just sit there and pull them and like every like I think it's like every 20 you win and so it's just kind of this like dopamine hit but anyways so he was gonna go into like Financial brokering or I something something in real estate or I don't even know and he called me up one day and he's like yo I think I'm gonna do this music thing and I'm like all right well like this is how I'd do it if I was in your shoes so he dropped an album and we started to look at the data together and I wasn't really involved for the first year but it started to look really similar to an in like an internet business like all the economics were like that when it came to streams and so I had this Epiphany I'm like yo I think we could grow this just like we grew grow any other digital product like it's just functions the the biology of this thing is it function functions like a digital product and so what we did is that exact thing I just talked about with the Instagram ads that grow the profile and then I what I would do is I'd have them go and I would like we go to a studio and he would play every one of the songs off the album so we drop an album and then every like couple every 30 days I get him in a studio and he would record live sessions of him playing the song we take those we CL chop them up into social i' schedule them out uh you know post or two posts a day uh across every channel and then we'd run these ads on top of it to grow the account but what we started to see is that we could influence the amount of streams by growing the Social account and by doing that exact process that I just talked about with with growing those Instagram accounts so what this turned into and once like as we got to this the unit economics of this thing is like we put a dollar and $3 would come out but the K the the crazy part about this is that once you get a fan in music they don't churn they come back to that back po that back catalog over and over until the day that they die right so that catalog has an intrinsic value that lives on and definitely even past your own existence so from a good from a business standpoint I mean this is why you know you look at Universal music group or Sony like they're absolutely powerhouses of companies it's because this media is built once but it lives on basically for forever forever which is really different in when in comparison to like books like it's fewer books that last it's fewer music is kind of this thing that Bridges Generations especially since it gets passed on from generation to generation so anyways music music is like real estate in that sense exactly exactly it totally is it totally is so our Phil our basically our strategy was like let's get you as big as we can get you on streaming and then we're going to wait till a label approaches you because there's this threshold right around 300,000 that labels will approach you so three 300,000 monthly listeners on Spotify a month and uh labels start to look at you because you're at a dollar amount where they realize that they can make money off of you especially if they layer over like ad dollars and all of these other you know like resources that they have available to them so label approached us we then got into like got them into a bidding war we flew out to Nashville and we just basically you know do dog and pony showed him around to every label he ended up signing with Sony Nashville but I think that this same thing could be done at scale and you go and you find these artists that I mean and there's millions of these musicians right like they make great music but they have no idea how to grow themselves and you go and you buy a percentage of their back catalog So 20% as an example and a lot of them are self-published they use a service called like drr kid or CD Baby which now some other parent company bought them but basically it's the the cost to get these L like these albums out the door is like five grand you know a lot of the times they're just doing it in their friend's basement but what you can see is that you can put a dollar into this thing and hypothetically like you can make money off of that for indefinitely into the future so what this turns into is the exit strategy here and and what I again found super interesting about this whole industry is that it functions a lot like software where you basically if you own that percentage the label wants to buy that back catalog so they'll buy you out for that percentage value and so you could have these mini exit you could have these exits basically of all these people so if you got them over that threshold over that Tipping Point and like how I'd probably do this if I you know was going about it was like I'd go and I'd find 10 musicians I'd do this deal this relationship with them and you figure out some type of structure where you're basically doing like a capital injection this is probably going to be Capital intensive on the beginning part but I'm talking like Capital intensive as oh it's a grand a month in ad spend right like but for them that's a huge amount of money right so especially if they're like you know young and they're figuring they're just figuring out this music industry please so you grow these people up and then once you get in one of these relationships with these labels or these management companies if you you just basically are bringing them the cream of the crop that you just grew so of these 10 probably two will hit and you're like yo label like I've got two that here's their growth metrics you go sell them and you just turn this into this pipeline of a way to build so traditionally they call like artist uh what is it artist development A&D I yeah yeah and so B this is this new way that you could do this but it's fundable by the economics of the company so the stream revenues could go back into the growth of the company you basically have to create this Catalyst event in the beginning and again you probably have to put I'm grasing like 10K aside over a 12- month period and to get like one of these people off the ground but of those two people that hit it's going to turn into such like it's it's a venture portfolio at that point it's the same it it functions the same but the difference is that the company lifetime like if you look at the S&P it turns over every 20 years right in contrast that this doesn't turn over it lives on into the future for forever and all of these people are accessible like you can DM all of these people tomorrow and be like yo we do stream growth this is how we function like it functions can we jump on a call to see if this is interesting for you we basically grow your streams we take a percentage of revenues and then if we can get it big enough we'll go and we introduce you to these companies that or these people that we know within the industry and that's this whole like business model that is like something I really want to do as well but again it's like a time thing so this is what it always comes down to you know what my favorite part of you is it's it's when you're 80% through a really good startup idea and like you're you're you just know inherently that this is a good startup idea that you just get it's gonna work you know it's work you're like it's so frustrating it's so frustrating and I'm like again I like I wake I wish I could just focus on like zero to oneing things like that's actually what I'm best at I was just talking to this company I'm I'm helping out some stuff with and for them like I am I am worthless after like a a series B like I'm as soon as you get HR like I am your worst nightmare like as an employee as being involved in the company because I I just I don't know how to function in those environments like what I'm really good at is like okay what are all these pieces and how do you synthesize them together and I think that that's the thing like if I like my dream longterm is like can I just focus on that it it was interesting I was just Ling to this podcast and they're talking about um like investing and how actually that's like when you look at Value investing that's actually what it is at its core is like you're spending all of your time analyzing all of this like you know these components of a of a of an organization or a company in a market then you synthesize that that together and like for me it was like I look at investing I was just like the most boring thing that exists right like it's just not interesting to me whatsoever but after hearing that I'm like oh maybe this actually is the same part of like that entrepreneurial you know or I don't even call it like it's just business person brain I hate the word entrepreneur because it's just so like ridicul like there's every there's there there's such a spectrum of this you know like it's like uh but like I'm talking like repeat foundershield having these and going to into the viral moments I mean I'm looking at your YouTube channel on a daily basis and how quickly it's growing like you're probably going to start like your P your monthly compound growth is probably going to be at 20% a month which means you're going to double every three and a half months right so you're gonna be at 100K Subs by end of year easily based off of your current growth metrics but we know that there's going to be a compounding or sorry there's going to be a an uh like a a like it's it's a compound growth effect right so the curve is going to go more vertical over time like that that that slope is going to increase so anyway go by the way if you're if you haven't subscribed to this YouTube channel what what are you doing like what are you for baby go do that and then subscribe subscribe to his newsletter and if you do that enough he'll maybe have me back yeah exactly although gonna have this be a weekly this will just be a monthly a monthly call Greg here's everything I've seen I want to brain dump all in this [ __ ] yeah another that we could get into is I think there's a newsletter consolidation opportunity right now like all of beehive made it so easy to make newsletters that it uh it flooded the market and content is an absolute grind most people are not built for it they're not built that way and so all of these companies right now could go and be acquired and you could roll them up all of those subscribers into a single thing I think you could absolutely crush it and build like easily a two to 10 million like subscriber new newsletter in this AI Tech space like based off of what we're seeing and I'm talking like I have a friend that's doing this right now um if you if I said the AI newsletter name a lot of you would know what it is it's one of the biggest ones and like for them like he's like I'm getting these I'm getting Subs at a cost that like I could never get previously like in the entire existence of this and we've you know they they've grown exceptionally well but just thinking about that opportunity of like this roll and you see it in all markets right like you have you have all all these startups that come in and then you have economic turmoil and you have rollups that occur and consolidation and it's the same thing that's happening here those Market forces are at work and there's this again is there's a huge opportunity to be a to media and then layering over the top of that you layer over all of these like YouTube shorts Instagram reals long form YouTube content like why is morning brew and all these places building all these social channels now well they realize hey this is great free top of funnel because for you page content just shows it to random people and we can get all these subs from it so it's the same it's this like that is the play that you could you could do and then go and build these other companies whether it's service businesses or any of the softwares that we're talking about on top of that and you can zero to one these companies overnight without having to raise Capital without having to doing any of this and this is really why I think that every company is turning into a media company is because it's it's economically more viable to do that than to do it in traditional ways if you were if you're going to acquire one of these AI newsletters how do you value some of these business so let's say they have 100,000 Subs like you know what do you pay per sub great question I would look you know it depends on if you're established or not for like an established company you can probably look at your CPM or cost per click or whatever that structure is that you're basically selling advertising for currently and then look at okay if I get these more you know these Subs on um what's the cost per sub to add them to my list and then what's the payback period to uh of acquiring those new people and like how much more can I charge basically by getting them added to that list the thing with this is that there's this Tipping Point that happens when you get a list to you know one million two million like these larger sizes where there's just so few lists and this is actually how the podcast industry works right like there's so few podcasts that produce all of the downloads that naturally what occurs is that you have have all like basically all all podcasts when they get to a size get approached by some type of media Network for some type of relationship because like 80% of all downloads come from you know 5% of the shows or something absolutely ridiculous right and so basically like it has to they have to be rolled up into this like and that's how most company like if you look at like a PNG right like that's how they want to buy media they want to go to a single like media buyer or whatever and and say Hey you know we're trying to do X and then they go and they find whatever we'll say 200 shows that they buy ads across that are you know within their their target psychographic or demographic but uh to put like a a number on it like if you could get email subs for under a dollar a piece like so say it's a 20,000 person newsletter and like it's an active newsletter like we'll say it's like open rates are averaging we'll say 50 plus percent and uh you know ctrs are in the range of we's say you know 7% or 10% Like if you get that at 15 grand like I think that's a good buy right like that's coming in at what 75 cents an email and and that to me is something that like would be incredibly hard to create if you were trying to do traditional acquisition strategies whether that's you know paid ads or like cross promotion of newsletters Etc so I think that that is like to me the challenge and the thing that I don't know and the thing that like my friend doesn't know is how are they going to roll this up into to a single like a single newsletter because long term when you look like you don't want to write multiple newsletters right like you want to write a single newsletter because it's just like build once it's it's an operations cost right and like this that that game is just you're you're you're beating up cost right like it's like so I I think that it's it's really how cheaply can you make it and then like how good are you at doing sales at scale so I ended up meeting him because he's like insane at cold email like at scale right because they are constantly selling companies to sub like basically Buy ad space on the newsletter and cold email is like one of the most effective ways to do that right but yeah it was a long-winded answer but I think if you get them under a dollar that would probably to me make sense just based off of what I've seen within the market here's my take and it's also a Warren Buffet take which is if you're going to do an acquisition it's all about a mispriced asset and a great brand so I think the mistake that a lot of these newsletters are making is they're monetizing via ads so to them a subscriber is worth 75 cents or a dollar whereas someone like us so we actually have an agency called LCA that literally builds the biggest AI products out there so we'll work with like a a Dropbox and be like hey let's go build like an AI first version of Dropbox or the Google of the world that sort of thing so a client to us is worth anywhere between one and two million bucks something like that now if you look at 100,000 person newsletter if it's high quality you know are there the chief product officers and VP products of some of these large tech companies then it becomes a literal no-brainer you can actually pay five up to five dollar or $10 who knows so that's how you have to think about it so the way to the way to think about it I think is start with a business that you know produces cash and you know is profitable and then yeah acquire and that's that's also the HubSpot model too right like HubSpot created the CRM High margins and then they started acquiring media after they figured out that okay we've got this great margin business let's go spend 20 million bucks on the hustle totally totally I think that this is the bigger Trend that's happening in all business is do you know AER Electronics I think we talked about them last time yeah $6 billion doll market cap like they've basically been rolling up like electronic components and magazines and blogs and like you know any like industry Publications for the last 60 years that's their whole strategy right they're just a Content machine and they're selling a commodity product so that's the only way that they can do this and I think that this is going to become the standard like I this is how I think about owned media right it's like it's this long-term investment that can never be taken away from you and like as this thing grows and if it lives on long enough like the cost The Upfront cost of starting that thing approaches zero over time right so it's like a an infinitely decreasing curve because you're just like amortising it over like as many as long as the existence of the company happens I think the other piece too that people don't realize is that it's marketing leverage like why does a HubSpot or any of these other companies like you know and this is something that I learned when I was at Rupa Health like we saw that we grew this podcast that became like known within the industry and companies that previously would not even take a call with us were inbounding being like yo can we sponsor the podcast which allows for us to create relationships with them and then cross- sell them into like our services and get in deeper you know business relationships with them and like that is something that's like incredibly valuable that people don't talk about is that you can create leverage especially as small companies and this is why I tell like every startup like what you should do tomorrow is you basically scrape every person in your target audience you callemail every one of them you C DM every one of them you import them into Facebook ads Google ads LinkedIn ads and run uh display ads to them across all those places you then take uh that uh email or anybody that signs up you put them into an email nurture and then you make you go and you create a podcast that's about that specific tarted ICP and like name it something that's like as specific and direct to them as possible so like literally their job title podcast and then you build a newsletter that promotes that show and I've like literally seen this and done this with companies where it's like in 12 months we can get them from like nobody knows who they are to they're now at a conference and the founder is recognized by somebody right and like that is what the the power is with these things but the bigger kicker is then suddenly okay I want to go negotiate with a larger company in this space and somebody who I have no business talking to is now coming to me basically with their hands out being like yo I want to get this from you like I and they don't know how to do this they do not know how to build digital media so if you can figure out how to flex that muscle like you're going to be so far ahead of everybody else that you're competing against over the next five to 10 years it's a good place to end I mean I can never end this but I we can talk for hours but we're not going to we'll have to do a part three at some point I love it man have me back whenever it's a good break in my day I love it halfway through a Double J and tonic life is good I'd love to see you fully done that Jin and tonic and see what you spew out actually probably amazing stuff I like the way your brain works it's good uh I always appreciate it Cody Schneider X X on Twitter and SW ai.com I'm going to link both in the show notes so people can easily get there anywhere anything anything else you'd like to say no that's it uh only other thing we're I'm just starting to roll out uh this done for you service for podcast actually that's like we grow newsletters for podcasts if that's interesting to you let me know uh it doesn't matter to the industry or the category we're focusing on B2B mainly to begin with but we can grow uh newsletters by about four to 5,000 uh subscribers per month and if they're bigger newsletters we can grow them uh by about 30 to 35% per month so reach out if that's interesting I mean I'm I'm interested bro I'm interested hit me up I will all right take care all right cheers brother [Music] baby

I buy brick and my goal is to make lots of money with it as much money as possible and spread awareness about it a lot of what I like to do is pres uh show people that they actually do have an issue a lot of marketing is like hey you do you realize that this is actually a problem uh and then showing people how they can work with it and I think that brick is probably one of the first products that's actually help me reduce my time on my phone and honestly I I just see also having a daughter now I really want there to be some infrastructure for people dealing with digital addiction but brick is just literally a utility and I think it could be turned into a brand a product uh education an a media company around digital addiction um so it could do something good but also I do think that's something that people would pay for especially entrepreneurs like me who are on our phones all day the first thing I would probably do maybe in in week one is I'd probably start a YouTube channel uh that YouTube channel would be 100% focused on grabbing all the keywords around uh digital addiction uh phone addiction um any I would just do the keyword research and and the easy way to do that by the way if you just want to be really uh very lowii is go to YouTube and start slowly typing in the thing like so for example I would write phone I would write first phone addiction and I would I would just press enter and I would remake the top three videos better than the ones that are there already then I would click into the first video and I would remake the first recommended video so the start of me creating a YouTube channel or the start of when we move into a new topic at AJ and smart is essentially remaking all of the most popular videos and I don't know if you know this trick I can't remember who I learned it from if you find a video that has a lot of views but very few subscribers that's something that YouTube really likes and so you you want to remake that video essentially so I would start uh one stream would be having a YouTube channel to build some sort of content awareness and it would be purely SEO focused so I'm not trying to build a like a YouTube channel like Mr Beast where people are super engaged I'm doing what we've done with AJ and smart where people are searching for keywords and finding us on YouTube that YouTube video would probably link to a free mini course or could be literally a small ebook or it could be a free community I mean we both use school.com um it would just be a place to n collect and nurture leads for a while so I would I would just be creating content collecting and nurturing leads on this topic of digital um digital addiction etc etc the product itself wouldn't be super to be honest like I'd rather do this without having to buy this brick product like the logistics behind that wouldn't be very interesting to me personally I think I would make I think one would make a lot more money doing this without taking on a physical product um what I would do is I would build essentially a media and content business an info product business around digital addiction um I would write the book on the topic but I wouldn't launch it with a publisher I would launch it the way that a direct response marketers launched their books and which is the way we launched our previous book uh I would use I would create a bookfunnel a bookfunnel is just like essentially you're you're paying you're you're losing money on every book because you're giving it away for free a physical copy of the book and you're getting but you're bringing people through like a a lead collection funnel and potentially upselling them to something like a course or something like that um I'm always thinking in the way the things that work for me is selling info products so I probably sell training in-person training uh I would I would very likely try to get corporates to book me and my team to do large scale digital awareness training for their employees and I think you if with me as the CEO we would probably max out a 10 million on a product on a business like that [Music] time baby

if you're a good marketer you would charge on performance right but most people aren't willing to take the risk this pay per performance agency why why is that a business idea that's exciting you right now because when I hear paper performance I'm like hasn't it been done before like why is paper performance an interesting startup opportunity right now I'll give you two stories on this one um so one of my friends his pay for performance agency does $80 million a year 30 million in profit and they have like 30 employees and it's like okay well that sounds agencies a boring business it doesn't scale well blah blah blah it's like no like all he does is he focuses on one industry and just runs paid ads he's really good at copyrighting they're really good at strategy he's his uh co-founder is Technical and they just build a lot of interesting things for people in that that industry and what they do is let's say you are in the finance industry I'll say okay well how much are you going to pay per customer like 500 bucks it's like okay we're going to run a test we're going to run some traffic towards you and if you like the customers we can continue the conversation but there's no need for long-term commitment you only pay us if we perform that's a good offer and my whole thing is as a marketer if you're a good marketer you would charge on performance right but most people aren't willing to take the risk um and I've always wanted to to emulate that model and so I don't think pay for performance will ever go away in fact I think you know we can go towards like smart contracts I think it's going to get even crazier right the best marketers are going to capture u a like even more value I also think that in like an AI world where an AI and just like data world the marketer has more data so they're able to underwrite yep and be like okay we're willing to bet on this particular opportunity right yep and here here's the other thing yes and like imagine all the stuff you're going to be able to build which you might get into but there's another pay for performance agency they focus on telecoms and um I think they're probably doing over a billion in Revenue now and one of the guys I used to work with at another agency a long time ago he was one of their early employees and they were like not really doing much at the beginning I think they were doing like a couple million dollars a year and then they started do this pay for for pay for performance thing tongue twister um where they would basically drive you leads through Google ads and then they get paid for the leads eventually what they did was they got bigger they started acquiring call centers and then they would basically just gift wrap a customer for you and then a bunch of private Equity like invested but they just gift WRA customer for like AT&T Verizon you know all these like T-Mobile and all that now um and so I think it's a big opportunity because there's not a lot of capital expenditures to set set it all up feel like a lot of people have done payer performance in the lead space is that correct like I Insurance lead sorry yeah yeah because like you want to go into a space where they'll pay you a lot for lead right so what other spaces would be interesting I think Finance uh depends on like you know I think there are are a lot of crypto companies reaching out to us right a lot of the biggest exchanges they all want to do pay for performance and you know there's money in crypto right um AI is a very broad space I think you need to focus on the actual industry you can't just say SAS or AI it's got to be like you know um for like hotels would be another example right it just wherever they're they're going to pay high CPAs right so you just make a list of industries that are paying high CPAs and then create a brand a landing page yep uh and you test it and like my friend by the way what he does is he creates a lot of different brands so he might have like 20 different websites like you know um California Hotel group or something or Florida hotel group and he just drives traffic there because like if I'm working with you and you decide you want to screw us or something sure you can cut us off but we'll just go to your competitor right and so the relationship is a lot more balanced now [Music] it's SI time baby

there's a there's a new subg genre that's really been catching fire that's called lit RPG have you heard of this no no okay so it's RPG like role playing games literature lit RPG but it's not literature this I mean this is this stuff is not well written at all but it's essentially reading a video game so you would the the story like you would open it and the person would be like I woke I opened my eyes and a button is flashing in front of me it's a Quest Giver he's giving me my first Quest and I have to go get a bow and arrow and I take my steps you're it's literally like articulating playing a video game okay so lit RPG anyway the takeaway is lit RPGs are catching fire okay new sub genre that's really really uh popular now and this guy that I'm talking to he's like what's so interesting about this subcategory on Amazon is that there's way more readers than there are creators there's a lot more people who want to read lit RPGs than there are people writing it so I spent an hour and I was just like going through the bestseller list of lit RPGs and I'm like wow this is a really great example of this Niche is starting to grow the writing quality is pretty low it's like very Indie the cover design is really low it's very Indie and if you were to go into that subcategory but with some money or with some funding and be like we're going to elevate the writing we're going to elevate the stories we're going to Elevate the book covers we're going Elevate The Branding and then you sort of incorporate all the stuff that we know and talk about where like you had a lit RPG specific newsletter to create that flywheel you had a paid newsletter you had like a digital product like you created that whole value ladder but it's all centered around this one very very very specific sub genre in Kindle unlimited I see a lot of potential in building super Niche like publishing houses where like I was even just think just entertaining the idea for us where like what would that take that would literally take you could hire a writer you could pay them cuz they get to write what they love you could pay them like five grand six grand a month Seven Grand a month they write those stories full-time each cover you invest three four five grand into but you're upside because you you potentially could own this sub genre there are books just for context because I have a tool that looks this up there are lit RPG books right now doing like a quar million a month this is why I love you because I would never in my entire life think about something like this but now I have 100 ideas that would go deeper let's go because if you zoom out what did you just said was identifying opportunities where the supply and demand are mismatched but specifically in the literary world right so my head goes how do you find all of the subg genres where there is more demand than current Supply and so you identified that because you have Niche expertise but almost you mentioned there's a tool of these books do high amounts of Revenue how do you build something else that goes okay here's the search volume and then the number of books in that category where there's a mismatch that's where you insert the niche publishing house and go okay cool this is underserved we're going to sta this one and monetize that mismatch until it's it's like finding Arbitrage within the Kindle Direct publishing Market M interesting yeah so that's exactly where my head went too which was how do you a SAS tool M that does that except you don't want to sell that SAS tool because you want to build the publishing houses yourself you build an internal tool internal so there so there's a tool called publisher rocket and it's made by this guy this guy owns a website talk about an amazing B website called um the site's called something self-publishing and basically or k Kindle publishing.com or something and all he does is talk about publishing via Kindle on Amazon Super Niche but like really lucrative site and he built this SAS tool where you can type in any book any subcategory any anything and it shows you the search volume it shows you the the average estimated sales of that book it shows you uh like keyword uh competition so I am obsessed with this tool like once a month I'll just open it up and be like what is this book doing I just want to see but the mistake I think there's two mistakes that people make cuz people have been doing this where you like look at search volume and then you're like okay I'm just going to write a book for this this the mistake that I see is one one is the person sees that opportunity and then goes okay I'm just going to go write one book for that keyword or that subcategory and then I'm going to do it again in a different subcategory and then do it again and then do it again and you don't ever have density in one you're just sort of bouncing around to like the next SEO opportunity whereas I see more OPP more opportunity in going this subcategory is exploding lit RPG I don't want to just write one book in that category I want to write a hundred books in that category so you just flood the density of that one subcategory and then second is when people do this they are more entrepreneurial than they are like publisher or writerly so what happens is they identify an opportunity but then they publish a lowquality book with a lowquality cover in that subcategory so even if it makes a little money it's like it just looks like it's all the same thing whereas if you spend some time going through these subcategories you're like it's really clear you know penguin random house isn't in this subcategory so you have an opportunity to go I'm going to walk in here and essentially look like a major publisher is taking this over but it doesn't cost that much money the reason people don't do it is because most writers don't have the money to do that one of the growing Trends in gaming is that more and more women are coming into the category so it used to be or at least the perception was like 8020 you know dude if you heard a girls voice in like Call of Duty in the lobby he was like what what's going on get out of here I I remember I remember the days 14 on the internet yeah and uh but now it's like 50/50 and so if you pair that with the fact that the majority of book readers and book bingers are female I think having female oriented lit RPGs could be a fascinating subcategory and differenti cuz I was scrolling through and every single book cover is like male enters game world be Dragon okay where's the female Market in that is is interesting and then a third stat I can't remember what it is directly but it's something like Kindle unlimited subscribers re because you have uh part of the subscription is you can read any book in Kindle unlimited like for free part of your subscription basically they read something like 8 to 12 plus books a month and so like the romance category these women that are binging these books they literally will read one of like Colleen Hoover is she's like one of the best selling uh romance novelist I study everything I I like to know everything about this um she's moving like millions of copies and her readers are literally reading one of her books a week if not every 3 days so there is tremendous uh demand and even the most prolific writers that are just cranking it out like what's the fastest you could crank out a book one a month maybe one every two weeks if you're just like screw everything just put it out so if you pair all that together and go female oriented like main character lit RPGs in Kindle unlimited multiplied by a 100 books with digital product or some sort of subscription on the back end I don't know man I can tell you with 100% certainty there's no one doing that so there's no competition which is always a good thing and I'm and I okay just to entertain the shiny object there's part of me that's like what is the real cost to test that idea Couple Grand Couple Grand a month maybe and then you could put out 12 books like one a month and you get a year of data and if you're wrong you burn I don't know 20 30 40 50 Grand if you're right that's like an entire new business because when one of those pops What naturally happens is then all of the readers go well I really liked that what are the other books in this subcategory LTV gets longer and longer dude when you see the math on these books it's mind-blowing so what is the math on these books just because I don't I don't know I mean there are books as big and these are like Indie authors they're a conservative like my book is doing well could go 20 30 40 50 Grand a month on Amazon the books that really explode and pop are 100 Grand 200 Grand 300 Grand a month it's nuts and how long does that last is that just like you know for 4 months it's 100 Grand or 200 Grand or I think it depends but I think on average it probably Pops to that for around like three maybe six months and then it levels off and hits some sort of plateau but there are series that and or like even just the author as their whole Library that's like yeah I have 50 or 100 books in my library and my portfolio does 200 Grand a month [Music]

what's so interesting about this subcategory on Amazon is that there's way more readers than there are creators there's a lot more people who want to read lit RPGs than there are people writing it dude when you see the math on these books it's mind-blowing so what is the math on these books just because I don't I don't know there are lit RPG books right now doing like a quarter million a month if you zoom out what you just said was identifying opportunities where the supply and demand are mismatched but specifically in the the Kindle Direct publishing Market MH if you pair all that together and go female oriented like main character lit RPGs in Kindle unlimited multiplied by a 100 books with digital product or some sort of subscription on the back end I don't know man this is why I love you because I would never in my entire life think about something like this but now I have a 100 ideas that would go deeper let's go [Music] because all right should we begin sure let's do it where do you want to start do you have any ideas for me you got ideas I I have one but is there somewhere you'd like to start no I know I mean whenever I talk to you guys I always leave just like rejuvenated with ideas so well first a question question for you guys do you have like an note in your phone that says startup ideas and you just like log it all the time I have a note that's called book ideas but not startup ideas do you have one that says startup ideas it's called ideas okay just ideas yeah I do not have that and I see a lot of people almost say like oh here's another startup idea here's another one I don't think about that all the time yeah you know why it's called ideas and not startup ideas because when I have an idea for a startup I need the least amount of time like I need the time between coming up with the idea and like writing it down needs to be as quick as possible so when I first came up with that note I was like I'm not writing startup ideas it's going to take like twice as long you know minimal number of friction the the perfect organizational system don't actually name things properly just throw it all in ideas so I say that because I don't necessarily come up with a ton of ideas but I like hearing other people's and immediately saying if they're good or not so that's my strength if you guys have better yeah exactly I hear something go that might not make sense but this might so I don't have as many new ideas but I'm excited to jam on y'alls okay so i' okay so I have a very Niche one go so I was having this conversation earlier this week with um this other writer SL entrepreneur because he his business is he has a staff of writers and they're in the fiction space and he was telling me a lot about how Amazon organizes and tags different books and stories into subcategories and one of the most interesting takeaways from our conversation was he was saying if you want to create a new category of story so something that someone hasn't done yet you should not do the exclusive to Amazon because Amazon is you could publish to anyone or you can do Kindle unlimited that's like specific to their subscription service and the tldr of Kindle unlimited is uh you get compensated based on people who the number of page reads and then they have that total pool of subscription revenue and then it's like Spotify but for books so you get these little like royalties based on how how much people consume your book and so his Insight was he was like if you're creating something new you publish it wide but if you're creating something really Niche uh you should look at the existing categories in Kindle unlimited and then basically like try and stay in that category and then you're just playing the the better best game you know you're not trying to do something different and so then we got on the topic of there's a there's a new subg genre that's really been catching fire that's called lit RPG have you heard of this no no okay so it's RPG like role playing games literature lit RPG but it's not literature this I mean this is this stuff is not well written at all but it's essentially reading a video game so you would the the story like you would open it and the person would be like I woke I opened my eyes and a button is flashing in front of me it's a questgiver he's giving me my first Quest and I have to go get a bow and arrow and I take my steps you're it's literally like articulating playing a video game which if you think about it is like the male version of romance for females where it's like you feel more productive than playing a video game because you're reading a video game do you know what I mean okay so lit RPG anyway the takeaway is lit RPGs are catching fire okay new sub genre that's really really uh popular now and this guy that I'm talking to he's like what's so interesting about this subcategory on Amazon is that there's way more readers than there are creators there's a lot more people who want to read lit RPGs than there are people writing it so I spent an hour and I was just like going through the bestseller list of lit RPGs and I'm like wow this is a really great example of this Niche is starting to grow the writing quality is pretty low it's like very Indie the cover design is really low it's very Indy and if you were to go into that subcategory but with some money or with some funding and be like we're going to elevate the writing we're going to elevate the stories we're going to elevate the book covers we're going to elevate The Branding and then you sort of incorporate all the stuff that we know and talk about where like you had a lit RPG specific newsletter to create that flywheel you had a paid newsletter you had like a digital product like you created that whole value ladder but it's all centered around this one very very very specific sub genre in Kindle unlimited I see a lot of potential in building super niche like publishing houses where like I was even just think just entertaining the idea for us where like what would that take that would literally take you could hire a writer you could pay them because they get to write what they love you could pay them like five grand six grand a month Seven Grand a month they write those stories full-time each cover you invest three four five grand into but your upside because you you potentially could own this sub genre there are books just for context because I have a tool that looks this up there are lit RPG books right now doing like a qu million a month okay quick ad break let me tell you about a business I invested in it's called boring marketing.com so a few years ago I met this group of people that were some of the best SEO experts in the world they were behind getting some of the biggest companies found on Google and the secret sauce is they've got a set of technology and AI that could help you outrank your conf competition so for my own businesses I wanted that I didn't want to have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I didn't want to depend on ads to drive customers to my businesses I wanted to rank high in Google that's why I like SEO and that's why I use boring marketing.com and that's why I invested in it they're so confident in their approach that they offer a 30-day Sprint with 100% money back guarantee who does that nowadays so check it out highly recommend boring marketing.com this is why I love you because I would never in my entire life think about something like this but now I have 100 ideas that would go deeper let's go because if you zoom out what you just said was identifying opportunities where the supply and demand are mismatched but specifically in the literary world right so my head goes how do you find all of the subg genres where there is more demand than current Supply and so you identified that because you have Niche expertise but almost you mentioned there's tool of these books doing high amounts of Revenue how do you build something else that goes okay here's the search volume and then the number of books in that category where there's a mismatch that's where you insert the niche publishing house and go okay cool this is underserved we're going to staff this one and monetize that mismatch until it's it's like finding Arbitrage within the Kindle Direct publishing Market M yeah so that's exactly where my head went to which was how do you build a SAS tool that does that except you don't want to sell that SAS tool because you want to build the publishing houses yourself so you build an internal tool internal so there so there's a tool called publisher rocket and it's made by this guy this guy owns a website talk about an amazing website called um the site's called something self-publishing and basically or Kindle publishing.com or something and all he does is talk about lishing via Kindle on Amazon Super Niche but like really lucrative site and he built this SAS tool where you can type in any book any subcategory any anything and it shows you the search volume it shows you the the average estimated sales of that book it shows you uh like keyword uh competition so I am obsessed with this tool like once a month I'll just open it up and be like what is this book doing I just want to see but the mistake I think there's two mistakes that people make because people have been doing this where you like look at search volume and then you're like okay I'm just going to write a book for this the mistake that I see is one one is the person sees that opportunity and then goes okay I'm just going to go write one book for that keyword or that subcategory and then I'm going to do it again in a different subcategory and then do it again and then do it again and you don't ever have density in one you're just sort of bouncing around to like the next SEO opportunity whereas I see more OPP more opportunity in going this subcategory is exploding lit RPG I don't want to just write one book in that category I want to write a hundred books in that category so you just flood the density of that one subcategory and then second is when people do this they're more entrepreneurial than they are like publisher or writerly so what happens is they identify an opportunity but then they publish a lowquality book with a lowquality cover in that subcategory so even if it makes a little money it's like it just looks like it's all the same thing whereas if you spend some time going through these subcategories you're like it's really clear you know penguin random house isn't in this subcategory so you have an opportunity to go I'm going to walk in here and essentially look like a major publisher is taking this over but it doesn't cost that much money the reason people don't do it is because most writers don't have the money to do that okay I want to I want to Riff on this idea a little bit so first of all lit RPG it's sick i' read it it's if you could do a RuneScape one where I got to relive like playing RuneScape for hundreds of hours but I just get to watch one character dude that's what this is well you know what it is it's analog twitch ex exactly it's analog twitch yes so here's what I would do I would partner with the top 100 twitch streamers and be like I'm going to create oh that's smart because what's going to happen is people are going to notice people are using this tool and they're going to notice okay lit RPG search volume's going up demand and Supply mismatch there's going to be the AI rush to create you know people are going to create these books with AI and stuff like that and it's going to be like low to medium quality and it's like what's going to separate you from them well yes it could be like a nice cover and actually doing it well with writing but having uh the name and the audience yeah exactly the name in the audience and just be like listen um you know streamer I'll give you 50% of the revenue mhm and what so my only thought there is what is the over what what we don't like to hear on this startup ideas podcast show where I so I jump to what is the overlap of people who watch Twitch and also read books so this is what's so interesting about this this subcategory great great question okay did anyone see this is totally leftwing but you'll see the connection did anyone see that Tucker Max went on Tucker Carlson recently that's too many Tuckers for me by the way yeah no I haven't seen okay so tuck Max the author of I hope they serve beer beer and hell um really successful author I I skimmed through the interview it's like neither one is really my target consumption but like but I it popped up in my feet and I was like okay let's just see what this is all about but there was one there was one line in there that really stood out to me where Tucker Max is talking about him publishing his books and he goes I can't tell you how many people how many uh fans have come up to me over the years and said I've never read a single book these are like just guys that want to read about his debauchery you know he's like I've never read a single book cover to cover except for yours and I thought that was such an interesting example of uh especially because the majority of readers are female like two-thirds of all readers are female not male but he was a nuts example of writing something that brought a ton of people who weren't reading into that category and part of me wonders if the same could be true for gaming cuz the majority of Gaming viewers are male you know and okay question and are is Gen ZZ reading books are they reading books I think so I've seen some interesting stats like all over the board where it's like yes but a lot of the reading experience has changed like have you heard of watpad yeah which is like the fiction it's also very like romance driven and stuff but watad is nuts because it's a lot of really young people reading a ton but it's really low quality writing but because it's genre specific and it's digital and it's like a different medium it was also acquired by South Korean company so I imagine a bunch of the readers are from Asia yeah from Asia that's a thesis I don't know there's also a big audience there for like manga and comic and you know things like that like your average I'm gen Z for what's worth I'm on the edge are you officially 28 or 96 is the cut off boy so I'm not tell us what the kids are doing yeah exactly see I think the cut off is like if you actively have a Snapchat do either of you actively use Snapchat like I have not used Snapchat in a long time if we did it would be concerning right that's the thing like you could take us to prison right right away I am right on the edge where I have not opened Snapchat in like 7even years some of my friends do it's like a 50/50 split I remember using it a ton in high school but you were clearly not genen Z if you don't have one and if you have one I think you were like / Zoomer or whatever it is you know what's another great uh like data point that proves that do you remember this was like a couple months ago with the Instagram CEO went on some podcast and he was like yeah the most used feature on Instagram is uh not the feed not the Explorer but it's DM because gen Z and young people are just sending content to each other in their DMS all day and I had this moment where I was like I haven't checked my Instagram DMS in four years like what this is the most used feature that's the yeah old person young person test right there so my thesis no data to support this I don't just practicing it as most thing as most good thesis are my thesis is most of gen Z haven't read a book have not read a book and it's a great question and actually not and but I think that's going to change there's now this new trend around like anti-tech anti-tech and books are going to be this like I'm reading this paper thing exactly you're not going to believe it Counter Culture yeah interesting I mean the reality is a book is super hard to compete with you know a video game where a video game Call of Duty is like optimized like literally for I don't know if you can undo the brains man yeah like if you grew up on an iPad I hated reading because I played a ton of video games I mean you know this you you are a professional World of Warcraft person like these video games hijack Jack your brain and you just get immersed in these worlds now you can make the same argument that well a book could immerse you in these worlds yes but it's just a lot more work a lot more people don't go to the gym than go to the gym that being said I think that whatever if you know 10% of gen Z reads now I think in the next 5 years 20% reads um and I think it's because it's the shift around uh anti-tech but I do think that the vast majority of are just going to be like I grew up in a Call of Duty world it's just hard for me to like sit down and be in an analog world okay so couple couple interesting things to tie together so one is one of the growing Trends in gaming is that more and more women are coming into the category so it used to be or at least the perception was like 8020 you know dude if you heard a girl's voice in like Call of Duty oh in the lobby he like what what's going on get out of here I I remember I remember the days 14 on the internet yeah and uh but now it's like 50/50 and so if you pair that with the fact that the majority of book readers and book bingers are female I think having female oriented lit RPGs could be a fascinating subcategory and differentiat cuz I was scrolling through and every single book cover is like male enters Game World defeats Dragon okay where's the female Market in that is is interesting and then a third stat I can't remember what it is directly but it's something like Kindle unlimited subscribers re because you have uh part of the subscription is you can read any book in Kindle unlimited like for free part of your subscription basically they read something like 8 to 12 plus books a month and so like the romance category these women that are binging these books they literally will read one of like Colleen Hoover is she's like one of the bestselling uh romance novelist I study everything I I like to know everything about this um she's moving like millions of copies and her readers are literally reading one of her books a week if not every 3 days so there is tremendous uh demand and even the most prolific writers that are just cranking it out like what's the fastest you could crank out a book one a month maybe one every two weeks if you're just like screw everything just put it out so if you pair all that together and go female oriented like main character lit RPGs in Kindle unlimited multiplied by a 100 books with digital product or some sort of subscription on the back end I don't know man I can tell you with 100% certainty there's no one doing that so there's no competition which is always a good thing and I'm and I okay just to to entertain the shiny object there's part of me that's like what is the real cost to test that idea Couple Grand Couple Grand a month maybe and then you could put out 12 books like one a month and you get a year of data and if you're wrong you burn I don't know 20 30 40 50 Grand if you're right that's like an entire new business because when one of those pops What naturally happens is then all of the readers go well I really liked that what are the other books in this subcategory LTV gets longer and longer dude when you see the math on these books it's mind-blowing so what is the math on these books just because I don't I don't know I mean there are books as big and these are like Indie authors they're a conservative like my book is doing well could go 20 30 40 50 Grand a month on Amazon the books that really explode and pop are 100 Grand 200 Grand 300 Grand a month it's nuts and how long does that last is that just like you know for 4 months it's 100 Grand or 200 Grand or I think it depends but I think on average it probably Pops to that for around like three maybe six months and then it levels off and hits some sort of plateau but there are series that and or like even just the author as their whole Library that's like yeah I have 50 or 100 books in my library and my portfolio does 200 Grand a month how many authors actually look at data first and then decide to write a book Based on data I think it's not writers that do that I think it's entrepreneurial people who do that and then they are just like and I'm just going to write to fulfill on the demand but I think the people who are actually talented at WR wrting almost never think about this which it's like the whole game you know yeah this an interesting experiment in leverage because you have this idea and something we talk about is I think horos has got a great def definition of power the ability to go from idea in your head to thing in the real world so you have this idea how many different steps are there between you executing it if you had all the resources possible it would be being test tomorrow Y and then it's a nice okay why can I do that what would I need to do that and how could I set myself up in 5 10 years to operate that way or I can be testing these ideas that come to my head because you just said it what is actually required it's a couple Grand it's a writer it's the tool to do the development or do the research theoretically you should have one person who can hear that idea from you and go okay that is being executed on right now yep and I think from a portfolio company perspective that's you want to get to Y because right now you go I'd have to write it I'd have to do the research I'd have to and it's just not worth the upside the risk reward relative to the other opportunities you have is too high but if you someone else was doing exactly if you can put yourself with incentivized upside on that person then there's no reason you can't have those ideas and actually actually execute them I was just uh I was just on the phone within operator um why is that in quotes I'll tell you why cuz I I was like yeah I'm looking at an operator for they have this idea for this business and here and it's a great idea and here and here's here's why it's going to work and it's like a shoe in and and he goes by the way just so you know no operator likes being called an operator you know like we're never call an operator an operator we're like why we're an Entre we're entrepreneurs like we we build the business an operator it sounds like a cck it sounds like he's like it sounds like I'm operating a crane like I'm operating a cran yeah you kind of are kind are man but you know I think as someone who I identify more with operation than I do coming up with ideas like I talked about at the beginning I love being called an operator the opposite would be you're an ideas guy uh and you don't do anything you know hey don't look at us interesting I think they're a poor operator though but yeah I I think that not enough people take their ideas and find we'll create basically a mini idea lab where they're like okay instead of investing let's say let's say you have a couple hundred grand of of cash which like erck Bachmann is the only example from Silicon Valley of like the ideas guy he like operating the household when founding avat exactly so you take instead of investing you know into the S&P you you you find an operator um and you use data to inform some of these bets and you like this is a perfect bet where it's like okay if I'm going to invest five four grand a month three grand a month share the upside but this thing could potentially pay back 20x and there's like IP in it yes um oh okay sorry so real quick on that so this entrepreneur I was talking to he was also like man for years I've been basically doing this model he would like find a niche and then put out volume in that Niche and and capitalize on it he was like recently what I've learned though is you actually don't really care about making money on the book and he's like now we will spend money with advertising to drive more page reads because what the film studios care about is how many downloads and Page reads it has so you might make 100 grand on a on a fiction book that does really well but who cares because I could take that IP and turn it around to Paramount and they'll write me a check for $2 million to turn that into a series and I was when he said that I was like like not only is the is the cash return 10 or 20x if you get it right but the long-term IP value dude and you know what's C and the thing he said to me is he was like and this is this requires more time reflecting on but he was like you come from the world of copywriting ghost writing content writing he's like if you know how to do that and then you apply it to fiction or storytelling you are 10 times more dangerous than the person who came up in the storytelling world but has no knowledge of hooks or selling or like and and the difference and this is part of this other book I'm working on called writer career paths but if you look at the bestselling non-fiction authors James Clear Mark Manson whatever they are a tenth of the best-selling fiction writers the the IP value is astronomically different you know James Clear goes and makes 30 million off Atomic habits John Grisham makes 300 million off of legal Thrillers plus the value of his library and IP so what is even more interesting is if you think about that bet and you go I'm going to go into a sub genre I'm going to elevate The Experience I'm going to flood it with quality volume you're also not just building cash flow from book sales or long-term IP value turning it into series but you also could break that into its own company and then a publisher goes whoa you built a niche Library will acquire your little publishing house for whatever so you also have exit potential do you know what the multiples are on publishing houses I have no idea but I'm going to guess it's in the ballpark of like 5 or 10x cuz you're buying IP it's got to be it's not 2x you know 5 to 10x profit or Revenue I'm going to guess it's probably Topline because they care more about the longterm value so it let's just say it's 7x that's a that's a nice round number to use let's just say let's say it's 7.28 X is the average yeah nice SN let's make it difficult okay yeah let's say it's 7.28 X perfect perfect number you know what makes it 17.2 28x is if you have technology also true so if you're like hey you know penguin we're this like upand cominging publishing house that uses our our own technology that scrapes no dude I got it even better okay I'm sorry I'm sorry just need to keep going okay because I think the real value is you build a niche library and then you train AI on how to write that specific subject we talked about this last on the last episode so it's one thing to go I you know I'm dominating lit RPGs it's another to go and I built a 300 page prompt where AI can create the version of each new book to 80% and then we only need labor to take it the last 20% that is not a 5 or 10 next acquisition and later on the the deals that you have with creators and streamers could also do right that you know for the next five years you could license their name for all these books MH and by the way total side maybe people are doing this already but talk about like a startup ID I would never do but I think would crush it I don't understand because romance is the biggest um literature category it it literally is 10 times bigger than the next biggest category and I don't understand with the explosion of only fans why the biggest only fans creators aren't partnering with ghost writers and writing I'm dead I'm dead serious this goes back to the overlap of reading and only fans no no but this is this is the thing is that the majority of romance books are women that are literally reading porn at home right but only is the majority are women so you're then still convincing men to read That's that is true that is true same the same core issue there's AE issue we have a bigger problem here it's that most men don't read maybe this would bring them into true true true like dude okay but like if you saw like the most popular only fans girl be like here's my tell all ebook of this experience that I had on only f i I have to believe that that would do some numbers more or less than they're making on only fans probably less but even if it was less yeah that's more for them you know I just I don't know this is the rider bias it's like I know you got this great business but a book but a book I know it's so I'm so you thought about writing you thought let me talk to you about writing a I know you got this this thing over here okay you hear let's talk about riding on the internet okay all right well I'm just saying look hey no one said that these were all going to be good startup ideas right we just promised startup ideas I mean that's why you need to talk with your friends about startup ideas right and put it on the internet and put it on the internet so you get feedback right now we went down that rabbit hole we know it's probably not a good idea but it might I'm just picturing like you guys see an elf where they bring in Miles Finch and he like sits down like all right we're bringing her in we got to pitch her on this book and she like sits down and calls across the table and like you just you need a you need a memoir you need a just the rate of Revelation could be really high we need an opening hook I'm just saying anyway that's the only startup idea I came with today honestly like that was pretty damn good I like it yeah I mean a lot there and what I like the most about these exercises is there's a world where all that could happen and it's simply a skill deficiency as to why it hasn't happened correct it's literally and that is like the both exciting and the frustrating part for me when I hear ideas like that I'm like if I was better at this game I could align the pieces of Leverage to pursue that idea if I thought it was good but I don't have the leverage I don't have the hiring skill I don't have the ability to prioritize so it's I hear that and just kind of get frustrated that I'm not good enough to do it I don't know if y'all feel that way I also think that yes I do feel that way but I also I also think that you got me thinking that there's a whole variety of competitive analysis tools that are probably great businesses to build but the thing is you don't sell it yeah you use it for your own Advantage use it for your own Advantage so you have things like um Jungle Scout for Amazon right you have things there a tool I use called Gummy Search for Reddit um there's all these tools in a bunch of different platforms first of all there's a whole like here's a prompt for people listening like what are competitive analysis tools for platforms that are up and coming that haven't been built yet and then go build them and then just use it for yourself and train yourself and think about ideas for yourself like for example there's another one I I was using called Etsy hunt it just goes on Etsy it's basically jungle Scout which tells you like how you pay for those you pay for them yeah people pay a monthly fee but it's one of those things where the price discrimination is completely wrong like I don't remember exactly what Etsy hunt charges but it's probably like less than 50 bucks a month but if you create a killer like there's some Etsy sellers who make millions of dollars a year yeah the real value is knowing how to exploit the data not necessarily the data itself exactly you know as like a meta question I'd be curious to get your take on this too is I think the thing with startup ideas like this what we just talked about is a great example like I actually think that what we talked about with the lit RPG stuff is an amazing idea but I'm sort of aware that I don't know that I want to be the one to do it you know and so when you when you come up with ideas the mental model for how do you decide what you want to do or even what you want to put your name on versus you're like I know that's a great idea and I know that would crush but I'd rather hire someone or hire a small team to do it maybe even put it under their name or a different name you know and like what what is inside your core portfolio both from like a time and a person ction or brand standpoint and what is under a tangental portfolio that's more uh distanced from you I think it's a good question to ask like whenever you especially People Like Us who are on the internet and like ride and do podcasting and stuff like that like you have to it's important to have like a theme like it would be pretty random if I created an only fans competitor for example I thought you were going to say a count or or a count both of those would be out out of your ball you'd be like I don't you know I don't I don't get it but I hope you're okay Greg you know like I'd be getting a text saying like you good or something like that you good bro yeah so you know one exercise I do just for myself is like I have like this is my this is kind of like my mission this is my Mo and this is like my lane or my two lanes I want to be in and here's the portfolio businesses that support that that mission and I think everyone should have that you have that with like writing and start writing and that like that category um but that's one of the reasons why I started this podcast which is like the commment section of this like maybe we might find someone who's like yeah I I actually am passionate about lit RPG like I'm one of those people if you want to do that DM me like there yeah DM DM him like there's um there's probably someone like screaming at their podcast listener right now and being like these idiots like you know why am I still listing that yeah there's hundreds of thousand lit r G is like the biggest thing ever and um and that's where I think having these spitting up these like small idea lab teams make a lot of sense where uh it's not you but you're you're advising and you're accelerating them have you thought about any writing almost taking the ideas that are talked about and have someone write up like threads or long form content kind of extrapolating here's how I would do this thing as a way to rep purpose your content at all that's a great idea yeah like imagine someone doing a mini Deep dive on this market and you just have a team that they hear the startup ideas because V1 is putting the podcast together hoping someone dis listens to this exact episode that's interested in lit RPG V2 is writing it up and distributing that specific thing so the ideal person might find it with and like taking the time to do some due diligence and data and be like we went we took this idea from the podcast we researched it here the takeaways let's curate it Point people back to the podcast but also show what we found a build a big SEO thing with that cuz I don't think necessarily I don't think you have a subscription model of like we're just going to send you cool startup idea breakdowns because I I wouldn't personally pay for that kind of like Trend we actually we added a so we have like a paid membership to $149 a month and one of the things that people get a lot of value is this monthly we we go like hey we were on Google Google Trends and we were on Reddit and we found like these Trends and here's like a couple business ideas to support it and it's a monthly email and like some people have said like just that email alone this kind of like a show that's a great idea it's also it that checks a bunch of the boxes that we've learned with paid newsletters it's infinitely repeatable it's tied to a financial outcome okay well let's take that and apply to our Niche how do we make a trends of writing businesses and where and and uh category what is the what is the niche down version of Trends forx industry so you just said great same same thing it's if you're a writing based entrepreneur and you're interested in this world what is the I want to see what the Google Trends are on this I want to see what Amazon's doing on this what is uh all these different publishing platforms on this topic and the 149 a month same thing you can charge higher because it's like generating a legitimate business idea from them that's we should just go do that that's a great idea you totally should and you know what the beauty about all this is is it puts you at the focal point of an industry so all of a sudden like even with like Community Empire like I have I just see people building these types of businesses now and then all of a sudden I can invest in them we can acquire them trends for X it's the it's one of the reasons why I actually like event businesses so like B2B events you know is interesting because the host of the event ends up meeting everyone like I have to go in person yeah no I just like theidea I'm not leave my house I'm not saying like I'm doing it but one of the one of the best parts about the event business is the host gets to know everyone in a particular industry and there's a lot of value and being the gravity in a particular industry and when you end up creating what you're what you would be doing here which is really cool is you have this you're giving people an unfair Advantage basically whenever you give someone an unfair advantage that's really good the more I'm thinking about that that's a problem with doing a podcast like this though we did this last times like I walk out of here and I sat down this morning and made like a priorities list and then I have to just figure out where this shiny object slots in and again it's a skill issue and a resource issue but I also think I mean we have some pieces Justin's a great example could create a template for this and then go okay Justin help us execute this you know we can do it for you too like you know that's one of the reasons why I built a bunch of agencies is cuz like now my agencies are my idea Labs I have a design agency when I need designs I have an SEO agency when I need SEO I have an ad agency when I need ads I have a you know Community team when I need Community stuff I literally have everything and that's also one of the benefits of owning agencies but keeping not growing agencies for the sake of growing it keeping it like it's almost like an in-house your Finance your team and saying while you're not working on my ideas make a little money elsewhere but if my idea pops up you're I'm going to be the one who employs you and it's okay even if it breaks even because it's like we talked about that a bit with the ghost training side yeah even if it breaks even even your agency breaks even it's like not the end of the world because you've compiled an amazing team who have this who are jelling so well together and then and no agency works at 100% productivity good agencies work at 70% productivity at best um so realistically if you're at 40 or 50% you can use that 20 30 40 50% on your own projects and you don't have to pay for it got to stop more I can feel the future energy required to execute on these we had a nice priority list till you showed up Craig I'm sorry it's okay I'm just going to write this as an email send it to myself in six months and say re listen to this once you've taken care of the priorities uh thanks for thanks for jamming oh these are great yeah and um where could people find you on the internet I don't know on the internet search around start rting online.com it's typically the best place if you want to start riding online or Twitter on Twitter Twitter LinkedIn we'll we'll link it in the in the in the show notes so people just click there and shoot us ideas shoot us DMS if you have ideas happy to jam on them once the priority list that we currently have gets worked through but this is a lot of fun yeah this was a lot of fun all right thanks for coming on later boom see you everyone it's the pod [Music]

all right so the fir first idea is uh I want to start with the selling a like subscription service to unlimited designs for Cricut um so Cricut for people that don't know is like a tabletop CNC machine that Crafters use um it's like it huge market share it's one of these companies that's like in the billions that nobody knows about so basically how they make money is it's kind of like a printer company right where it's like they sell this like high ticket item um and it's and then they basically sell materials to these same people over and over again so the test that I ran was I was like you know what I wonder if I can get AI to basically make all of these graphic designs like that are svgs and these are the files that they use on these machines and so did that and then I was like cool so like let's just go find how many like different keyword phrases that are related to like C Cricut files or SVG files so if you go on like Etsy there's like millions of these shops that sell these types of things right and so anyway we're this kind of evolved into I was like okay we could basically at scale with AI make these SVG files based off of Target keywords that people are already searching we know there's an audience that already like buys these or wants these so now how do we get this in front of them so if you go on Facebook you can Target people that have an interest in cricket the website so we ran ads to them just to a Shopify store and I created a bundle of svgs it was like I think 20 different svgs that were all like horse related right like floral horse SV VG and uh like floral HSE head SVG like all these different you know variations of it we were getting less than $1 downloads of this thing so like imagine you want to make a list of 10,000 customers like you just go and basically spend like five grand and suddenly you have an email list to zero to one this then what you sell to them um and there's already companies that are doing this that are huge one of them is called creative Fabrica they're doing I think around like 30 million a year they're funded it's ridiculous it's some European company that again nobody has ever heard of but what do is they sell an unlimited subscription to the svgs that are on the site so then it's a recurring Revenue so what you get them in the door with is this free package and then just put them in a drip email nurture that's basically like want unlimited svgs you can create this so why this opportunity exists now and why it's easier than it was previously is because you can make all of this different uh like files types like at scale with AI and you couldn't do that previously so like five years ago if you wanted to do this you know you have an offshore team of like thousands of graphic designers that would be just yeting these out into existence and then putting them on your site now you can do that same thing with like these tools like s you know background removing tools and then just like upscaling like tools and then you basically like take that upscaled black and white file turn it into an SVG like that whole thing that I just described there's apis that exist for every single one of those so like again when we made that little bundle that was like these 20 different things that that what we did is like they generated in Discord we down like we had a bot download them we then had uh uh a GitHub repo upscale them we then hit an API to remove background we then uh hit an API to turn it into an SVG and that package was all created with no human intervention all we did was just provide the target keywords that we already knew that people were searching for so basically you could zero to one this Marketplace overnight get your initial customers and then the long-term play with this is you then go and you build like 100 of thousands of these landing pages on your Marketplace and get those to rank organically for SEO which creates more inbound you give them like you know when they sign up they get one free Bundle download or something and then you upsell them again into that subscription and when you think about the size of this market like this is easily A10 million doll a year company like you could do this tomorrow like I want to do this so bad but again it's just like one of these things that I we just don't have time for so anyways happy to time deeper on any of that but yeah so I don't know if I I live under a rock but I never heard of cricket it was on uh MFM at one point I think it was like two years ago and I was just laughing to myself when they mentioned it because like so I've been selling um in the print on demand space since like 2010 right so really early in that made a bunch of money in it lost even more money in it uh because I had no idea what I was doing early on and like how to build brand and actually like do it well um but yeah so that that's like kind of why I know this exists and I this probably was like in two you know during like the the late days of of the pandemic that they like brought this up on one of the shows and again we we know that like this space exist because there's so many people like when you look at Etsy majority of their sellers are these people that own these machines right and so what they're selling on Etsy and like driving all their revenue for Etsy is literally just like custom you know Tumblr mugs but they're building this with like basically like these SVG files and then uh whatever materials that they're buying and actually using on the printer to like you know make these die Cuts or you know whatever it is that they do that they add to these customized products so and if you were going to build an MVP of this how much money do you think it would require I think you could get this off the ground for like 10 grand like 100% like 10 grand and the five grand in ad spend like you just use like Shopify already has like a subscription feature and I I would just use like off-the-shelf tools longterm it would like you would hit limitations with the amount of Collections and like landing pages you could build on shop I say that but like there's also this like thing you can do with Pro Shopify just we could go to into this this is another company that's on the list so we can come back to this but Shopify just released this ability to like you basically make these sub folders and then we figured out how to use cloud flare to like bulk create collection pages so traditionally Shopify has a API rate limit that's like not great if you have like a ton of SKS so say you have 100,000 SKS and you want to make 10 million land landing pages for longtail keywords related to the SKS on your platform you just like couldn't do this right and so we basically figured out how to do this with like the technology like this Cloud fair and what Shopify offers now technology but the kicker was that we could have air write SEO content based off of those keyword phrases so again when you're saying like SVG horse bundle it could write all of the all the the content and that would go on that page so again when you look at like these huge marketplaces like like house.com as an example like how do they actually make money it's because they have millions of landing pages that all rank for all of these keyword phrases and they're basically just brokering traffic like that's actually what the business is when you look at a Marketplace like how marketplaces actually make money is they broker traffic for transactions and then they make even more money off the ads that they're selling on the platform like if you look at the like p&l of an Amazon as an example like where they actually make revenue is not the marketplace fees it's on people bidding on these specific items and the reason for that is like there's only so there's a floor on how low you can go on product cost right and like the margin you could squeeze out of that but there's no ceiling on ad spend that people can go right so it's like they can go up infinitely and you see this already in Google but we're just like like for example if you look at the lawyer space some cpcs depending like if you look at like DUI lawyer uh Denver right like the CPC on it it's like $110 right crazy absolutely crazy but when you look at that like the value like if they get if they close one of those that's like a 15K deal for that lawyer so of course it's like that right it basically can go up infinitely as high as the market can sustain it but you can all you can't decrease the costs like the cost has a floor so anyways to get back to this this idea of like how cheaply you could do it I think that you could probably get this off the ground for like 10 grand um and then it's just like you'd have to have like a little bit of technical knowledge to kind of like piece together all this but again our MVP was like a human put in like you know something into a Discord Channel downloaded and then just these public like API end points like it's not I mean a python script could do that whole thing right so so your Marketplace point I just want to talk about that for a second because I think it's really really smart so the best marketplaces to me are really Niche with high intent so yes Amazon has a lot of intent but it's not which is amazing like you're in the buying mood you want to you want to make a purchase and a lot of people buy on Amazon but at the end of the day like it's pretty horizontal whereas this you know your idea here it's like a pretty specific type of person and just like scanning YouTube right now it seems like a lot of women uh moms 100% yeah so moms seem to be really into it I was chatting with a buddy today who's building a Marketplace for uh Elder Care like how you know your parents are getting older um they need someone to come in house great idea yeah assisted living like in your house so he's building a marketplace around that super smart because not only are they gonna make money on the transaction of just like bringing you to connect you with this elder care person but now of a sudden you can sell them like 500 other things because you know where they are in their life cycle yes exactly also they're like typically historically like a high net worth individual because they've accumulated that wealth over their like whole lifespan right um I I want to I want to kind of pull out a piece of this as well on the marketplace side like I think that right now like every Marketplace could be disrupted like with AI tools right so like you have these huge players like Amazon I think you could cve out carve out these subsets like for every all these different niches that exist Within These large marketplaces and like historically like you'd have an engineering team of a thousand people they would be working on this massive Marketplace and it's like yo we just again like in our test that we did so my friend has this shop she has like 10,000 SKS and so we're like all right this that shop if I think talking about let's just like throw up a 100,000 landing pages and see what happens and we'll do some like Auto indexing on the back just like submitting to Google over and over again so like overnight increased her organic traffic by 10% and increased her organic Impressions by like about 20% so I mean again super small test it was only like over a six-month period validated the idea but I'm just thinking about that for like any sub like like custom Koozies or like you know any of these kind of weird Niche spaces you could B basically build out these sites now for so like so cheap of cost like this I I think that you there there's this huge opportunity for uh Founders to just go and do these things if they want to create like a really powerful cash flowing business and like this is actually where I see the opportunity in programmatic SEO like everybody's like you know I'm gonna write 100,000 blog posts with AI from like it's general knowledge like all right that's kind of cool but like what if I do like 10 million product landing pages on a website right and like all it's selling is print on demand products you're at that scale like you're talking about as many like Pages as a as a as an Etsy and then building like okay how do I build links to this to actually get this to rank it's like just reach out to like Mommy bloggers and be like do you want a free product off this like pick one of these I'll send it to you at like do a post on your site and like that just costs you eight to build a link that has a DA of 50 like that's the that's the like economics of the business here from like a marketing standpoint so [Music] B

how the hell do you get in touch with literally everyone on the planet like how do you do networking this strategy is is Fault prooof like you you are able to pretty much meet whoever you want via this strategy and and you don't need hundreds of thousands of followers and most of those relationships began by just me literally reaching out on places like Twitter I'm sure a lot of people are listening to this and they're like well Greg like you have 300,000 followers of course it's easy for you to like DM people and they're going to respond but I've literally been doing this my entire life how do you figure out how to deliver value to someone who's already let's say 20 years ahead of you in the entrepreneurial Journey so the first thing [Music] is and we are back hey hey there hi hello we're doing this again are you giving it a name yet is it is it sipping time it's sipping time with Jonathan Courtney and Greg Eisenberg hey everyone I'm here to ask Greg questions the things that maybe you've been asking him in on comments and Twitter or things you've been wondering about and uh it's I think this is the this the show where occasionally depending on when Greg wants to do it he's the one being interviewed and not guests being interviewed you know what I mean I know what you mean I watched uh the episode we did uh that came out on Sunday and I did I because sometimes I was looking at the comments and I forgot we talked about this constipation thing we talked about uh Brian doing the reverse Brian Johnson where you try to get your age markers up as high as possible so you like die as early as possible I think that's going to be game changer for some people sounds like something we would talk about yeah Greg I have a I have a topic for you I have a question for you and this is something I actually genuinely have been wondering um and and and there's probably a couple of different angles we can take on this but I think one thing that one of the most valuable things I think your audience would love to know is how the hell do you get in touch with literally everyone on the planet like everybody I know every every investor every entrepreneur every company owner that I end up working with all already knows you before I meet them how how do you do networking like I don't understand it you're everywhere you're you're everywhere all the time how does it work so I do a lot of cold DMS on Twitter or just in general email Twitter you name it I'm not afraid to to just reach out to people and I'm sure a lot of people are listening to this and they like well Greg like you have 300,000 followers of course it's easy for you to like DM people and they're going to respond but I've literally been doing this my entire life my whole life just reaching up to people and when I was in when I was a teenager I'd reach out to people and I'd try to add value to people's lives and I was my early 20s it you know reach out to people and try to add value someone asked me the other day they're like I heard you talking on the podcast about having a mentor and I really want a mentor and which is by the way like I would never call My Mentor my mentor you know that's like being caught with my pants down you know like it's just you're my mentor Greg yeah no no no you know it's like too late too late you're my mentor now Mentor me m me yeah it's just something that it's an unspoken thing it's just like you have someone generally they're like 10 15 20 years older they've been through things that you've been through um and most of those relationships began by just me literally reaching out on places like Twitter and being like hey I see that you're you know you've built this thing not can I pick your brain for an hour oh [ __ ] that [ __ ] that yeah yeah I hate that that's the worst dude or like the PE oh let's grabb a quick coffee I'm like what why who are you quick Co quick Co let's grab a quick coffee so I can pick your brain so let me pay $2 so I can pick your brain for 90 minutes and just like exactly hijack your afternoon there's a great meme that maybe your uh Team can pull up um I posted it on my I don't know if I can share my screen right now so I'll just kind of post it to you exactly this is what I'm talking about this is how not this is how not to do it and I'm happy we're having this conversation because like so many people don't realize that this is not how you do it yeah so the question is how do you do it that's what I want to talk about there's a couple so can I can I pick your brain on a few different angles of this and try to try to be the voice of your audience here um okay first of all most people uh the first thing they say as you already said is oh easy for you to say because you have a big audience so now let's assume we're both talking about this from the perspective of people who started out doing this without audiences and then the second thing is okay the people you're reaching out to are probably already very successful um usually in the case that when we're reaching out to people they're a lot more successful than us at least I know for for me when I reach out to people they're more successful um and so they don't need a lot of the things you can provide how do you figure out how to deliver value to to someone who's already let's say 20 years ahead of you in the entrepreneurial Journey even if you don't have a large audience for example like what would be your what was your process well I think you you need to do the work so the beauty about today's world is let's just say you wanted to get in touch with me there's literally hundreds of podcasts of me talking about things that you know I might be interested in coffee you know that I like Miami you know that I'm Canadian you know that I drive a Volvo like you just there's a bunch of things that you can like grab you can and and here's like a hack on a lot of people's Twitter's accounts you can actually go to their likes so you can actually see what are the things that they're liking like it's kind of stalkery I didn't know this was public oh god oh yeah and I literally just hid mine like this morning because I was I was like I do this to other people so I was like I don't want other people to see what I like but the point is if you can see what people like and you can watch interviews of them you could you could understand how to position it so that you have an offer that connects with them yeah let's give some examples um I'll give one from a perspective of someone who had actually literally no following um back in 2016 I was reading a so I'm running a design agency um and I was reading a Blog from GV Google Ventures they had this blog and it was about they were talking about this thing called design Sprints um this guy called Jake knp who who was blogging about it um he was kind of like this person who I was like oh my God this is like the Silicon Valley designer that I would love to meet who like is doing all the things I would love to do and etc etc etc eventually he wrote this book called Sprint uh became a New York Times bestseller and I was still like oh my God this is this is amazing like I'm reading this book it's so cool I'm here in Berlin I have no internet presence or anything like that and again I'm just like this you know random person uh living in Berlin quick ad break let me tell you about a business I invested in it's called boring marketing.com so a few years ago I met this group of people that were some of the best SEO experts in the world they were behind getting some of the biggest companies found on Google and the secret sauce is they've got a set of technology and AI that could help you outrank your competition so for my own businesses I wanted that I didn't want to have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I didn't want to depend on ads to drive customers to my businesses I wanted to rank high in Google that's why I like SEO and that's why I use boring marketing.com and that's why I invested in it they're so confident in their approach that they offer for a 30-day Sprint with 100% money back guarantee who does that nowadays so check it out highly recommend boring marketing.com I was trying to figure out what could be a way that I could reach out and hang out with someone like Jake without just being like hey can we grab a coffee and I read this article from Ryan holiday it's called the canvas strategy have you ever heard of this I haven't it's it's like a systematic way to figure out how to deliver value to people who are like ahead of you and one of the things it talks about is that if you're the person who can clear the path for those in front of you you can also kind of choose the direction which is a cool way of thinking about it and so what I actually did is first of all I had to come up with an excuse to be in San Francisco so I got a I I offered to talk at this um kind of design and Tech Conference in Silicon Valley this was an an offered to do this for free of course and then I was in the region uh and what I did is I reached out to Jake and I said I have a an idea of something to pitch you that I think would benefit you spreading the word of Sprint all around the world it would also make you money and I've taken care of like 90% of the details already and he was like cool so I went to the GV office and pitched him this idea of traveling around the world and teaching design Sprints but I would use my marketing skills to sell out the events so that he wouldn't have to think about it and I would take on the really annoying part of set setting up the locations and doing all of that stuff he was like yes and this first of all we became really good friends uh and this opened up so many doors to me that I could never have imagined um all a lot of the Silicon Valley clients that we work with today are because of that relationship that I built with Jake but initially instead of just being like hey can we grab a coffee I really deeply thought about what types of things he might find interesting and thought about like what's a what's going to be really annoying if he wants to go and teach this around the world locations filling those locations um and so I just presented an option to him that was uh super easy and cleared the path for him spreading the the knowledge of Sprint around the world um and that was a cold pretty much a cold Outreach from me uh to the team at GV I didn't even have Jake's email address I just emailed GV um and this is this is the kind of thing I do all the time what's uh maybe one or two examples from you so I think that if you want to if you want your cold DMS to work you should create content on the internet like you should publish content on the internet because the hack is publish content on the internet one in every 20 50 100 even a thousand pieces will go viral see who likes your content and then once they like the content if it's one of those people that you really look up up to DM them instantly so I'll give you uh I'll give you a non-financial example of this so grow I grew up one of my favorite bands you know this is like the early 2000s who is it yeah it was Weezer you know alternative Ro yeah okay you approve okay great he approves weer yeah you know what I'm saying so um loved it and I played guitar as you can see in my background and you actually can't even see you can't see it but on that guitar there's a strap that is the same strap that Rivers quomo who's the front man of Weezer uh that's the strap that he used get a new name but it's okay exactly fast forward to about eight months ago and I I I tweet something and it just it goes ballistic goes viral what was it it was what was the Tweet the internet used to be an escape from reality but now reality is an escape from the internet oh that's good yeah yeah that's good so so I tweeted that n [ __ ] I don't like it no not [ __ ] I I thought about it again I don't like it well it doesn't matter if you don't like it because you know who liked it Rivers Cuomo Mr Rivers Cuomo yeah he liked it so it's like 11 p.m. I'm just about to like close my eyes I'm like aimlessly scrolling in bed you know you know just like oh I know that problem my eight sleep hates when I do this and I see he likes it so I go and DM him right away and I say and this is a tip for whenever you DM someone busy be short so I say I you hear this I bet you hear this a ton your art has been life-changing to me often in in La would be cool to hang out sometimes sometimes interesting yeah so sometimes you you wrote it wrong no I said it wrong I'm a better typer than I am uh Sayer of things so let's just break it down a little bit I bet you hear this a ton your is your art has been life-changing to me so saying the word art to like a musician like he's like oh it's art you know it's like this is something that's a compliment I think yeah and I'm with you you're with me okay then often in La I know that he lives in La I did the research right do the research and then I wrote would be cool to hang out sometime I'm not like would want to pick your brain and you know what I mean it's like very like nonchalant like if it works out it works out he responds instantly let's do it I'll be here until June what part of the world are you in so then I respond love that I'm based in Miami often in La I'll hit you up next time I'm there and let me know if you ever come to Miami I give him my number then he goes we'll do we're in Tampa in a few weeks with green day and he just puts his number in there [ __ ] man there's so many things you just said that we need to talk to your audience about here that's amazing two things one you did something that I don't even know if you know there's a label for there's this when you're reaching out to people who are let's say who H in this case you were trying to reach up to this person there's this concept and I think it was Daniel Priestley again I I keep referencing this guy who who came up with this concept of With Or Without You energy I'm pretty sure that was Bono by you too with or without [Music] you that's true I didn't actually think about that that's probably where it came from so this idea of With Or Without You energy when you reach out to someone you don't want to like you don't want to be like um what's his name again not Bono what's his name John Ross Rossman John whatever the weest guy right whus Weezer Weezer Rivers Cuomo the the guy Rivers John Waters all right like okay so so you reach out to rivers and if you were like hey um love your music whatever love your art uh can I come visit you he'd probably like H go like that's weird but if you say that the important thing is you're kind of like I I am there that is something I already do and it would be something that is just on my way it's on my journey that makes it seem less uh intense for people uh one example of this for me it's a bit weird to mention this online but uh or on on the podcast but uh I think he wouldn't mind it I was trying I I I really wanted to meet uh Noah Kagan and just saying I'm in Austin like all not like a week before or two weeks before just I'm here right now um and I was also like looking around what he's looking for he wanted help with his YouTube channel not to say that I helped with his YouTube channel at all but just reaching out and being like hey I am in Austin what are you up to sends me his number invites me to his house these types of things are so like there's a lot of nuance to it that you did there you didn't just reach out and say hey can I hang with you you said I'm already going to be in these areas and that's a weirdly important thing the other thing you and I are are you and I spoke uh were speaking to the same person last week Blake from uh who who Who's he actually is my mentor because I pay him to be my mentor and you somehow are already talking to him but we were talking about this topic in the in the Mastermind last week and he said one of the weirdest things with people who are very successful and very like powerful is they give out their number so easily and giving your number and just being like hey here's my number like whatever that is also something that a lot of people don't do but it's actually super powerful um and and in the background here's someone that I've been messaging with who I never thought I would have the number of they just it's it's so once you cross that boundary once you deliver value or a compliment or in your case it's content or it's like figuring out what they want and what they what what they can resonate with and then combine that with that with or without you energy it's not like me not meeting you is going to hold me back or anything and then a little number on top those things seem to be some juicy elements of uh connecting with people who could be your mentors or not even mentors sometimes it's just people who can connect you or people who you just really would love to meet totally yeah and and people are lazy about it dude people are so lazy people reach out I'm sure people reach out to you every day and they say hey can we grab a coffee like you're not trying to be mean you just I guess you feel like how do I even respond to that like I'm it even feels sometimes a little bit insulting if you're a busy person you're a busy person Greg and if someone just says hey can we grab a coffee and you're like who who are you what what what's the well every everyone is everyone is busy that's the truth everyone is busy and the people that are going to be lazy with those types of DMs I don't want to yeah spend my time with them I'd rather support people who non laaz non lazy people because those are the people that I think are going to actually do cool things in this world and then going back to the river story what's really cool about reaching out to someone who's like above you is all of a sudden if you show value to that person they give you access to their whole world so all exactly so all of a sudden like for forget Weezer for a second Green Day like I'm hanging out with Green Day like that's really cool um you know and what ended up happening with that story is I texted him and he's like I'm in Tampa in a few weeks I was like okay great uh I'll see you there and I went to hang out with him at the show backstage in front of like 50,000 people which was really cool dude you really hold back you keep your story you really hold stuff back I can't believe that this is I thought the end of the story was going to be you messaged him the whole thing actually happened happened so I'm backstage I brought a friend with me uh and thanks for the invite by the way I didn't want to go any well you're more of a YouTube fan you know if I was meeting Bono I would I would hit you up so I'm backstage and now all of a sudden I I can't even believe that he's hanging out with me like he could be hanging out with all these like cool people but he's hanging out with me and I don't want to make this conversation about me at all yeah so 100% of the conversation is about trying to figure out what is interesting to him and how can I add value to him yes and what what did I know about the situation I knew that based on the like of his tweet of mine like obviously this idea of being too glued to our phones and social media addiction was something that he's he was thinking a lot about so we started talking about that and from that I learned that he's actually a bit of a nerd like me and you and he's really into Ai and he's really he's like oh I coded up this like Discord bot so all of a sudden now I understood that and I was like oh let me tell let's talk about how we can make your Discord bot better let's talk about how you can make an interesting Community for for Weezer oh oh hey we just worked on something for Fred again uh that I think might be really interesting for you and then it was just at the end of the conversation he was like oh dude I want to hang out with you again like let me know next time we can hang out I think the another thing here I'm just trying to break apart the the kind of principles here you also I I sometimes draw this for people when I'm showing them the canvas strategy if you're watching this if you're not seeing this it's basically a circle this is where you are you're on you're at this part of your life the Weezer guy is here and then hear all of his connections right and you like want to move up this ladder or whatever it is but a lot of people are not humble enough to also realize that they are below somebody and I think for me one of the things and because it sounds weird to say it it's like I am below this person it doesn't mean you're below them as a human it just means that maybe they're ahead of you in certain parts of your life and I think it's very difficult for people to be humble enough to assess where they are and often in your case what would have happened is would have gone if you were not humble and you didn't understand the laws of power you would have gone there and talked about yourself for two hours uh but you understood that the dynamic stays in place essentially and that you still have to deliver value um and this is something that once you understand it once you understand that there is this like dynamic in the world you can really really connect with a lot of very interesting people I think getting too comfy with people getting too cozy with people after you meet them the first time is often away or getting too familiar and overstepping boundaries that's like next level ninja [ __ ] to not do that when you actually get in the door I mean this this literally change has changed my life this way of communication because it now all of a sudden I could literally meet and I I try I want to say this I don't want to sound like pompous but like I could meet I pretty much I'm pretty sure I can meet almost anyone via this strategy yeah and and so what is it it's content throw out content that's applicable to people uh and attract them see who likes it DM them keep it short and sweet meet them go to where they are add value to their lives that's it I think as well it's just another example is we're doing this podcast right now which is going to give me extra exposure we're doing it because I thought for a long time about how to bring value to you and your content universe and I was reading your tweets and I was looking at your show and then I was looking at other people's shows and I was like I wonder if there's a way that I can just take some of the heavy lifting uh of a maybe like an extra episode so that Greg can still grow his podcast he can do his own advertising on the podcast I can be in the background and I can still bring value while getting connection to you learning a lot of stuff uh but also getting connection to your audience it would be we I was joking about this earlier with my girlfriend I was like if I didn't understand this world then like uh if you think about how stupid it can be where like two EP like next right after this episode I'm like hey dude I'm just going to send you an over over an invoice for the work I put in for this just like it this super shortterm thinking when people play these games you know it's like oh hey yeah actually now you have to pay me to do this totally even though I am getting a massive Advantage because I have no audience that's also a thing if people are wondering like how do you grow an audience nobody listens to my podcast great like two weeks ago nobody was listening to my podcast I went on Greg's podcast and now more a lot more people are listening to my podcast but I also had to think about how to bring value to Greg's life um instead of just being like hey dude [ __ ] you put me on my podcast there's a level of like you you you just you have to have some level of understanding your position in the hierarchy of whatever it is you're trying to do um and that's very tricky for people there entitlement comes on very fast when people like often someone will meet me they'll like put in some effort and then they're like super entitled immediately why didn't you hire me like what what are you talking about you know what I mean do you do you know what I mean I know exactly what you mean I know exactly tell me yeah and I think with you specifically you sent me a message with a loom a loom video of a pitch to you I pitched it to you you literally pitched it to me and it was I don't know maybe a 4 minute Loom and I I'm not going to lie I put on 1.5x people listen to this podcast I'm [ __ ] 10x you know at least I put it on at least 1.5x but I was listening to this and I was like okay what do I have to lose by recording a 30 minute conversation with Jonathan a lot nothing 30 minutes you know yeah your entire reputation so I was like you made a pitch to me you you did it in a fat in a easy to consume way for me I think Loom by the way so underrated as like just a great way to pitch people yes and you're using you're sharing your screen you're you're showing visuals and I was engaged the whole time we did it you show you you came to that conversation prepared it was fun of course we're going to do another version you know another episode so and I also don't know if you noticed this but when you asked me at the end of the podcast where people can find me cuz we talked about your like your newsletter and all of that stuff I actually didn't tell where people can find me I asked people to go and write reviews for your podcast and your Spotify and I tell people where to find me at all and that's like in my opinion part of being valuable is also not just fully taking advant you don't have to like squeeze every situation dry you can just see where things go and enjoy them like I think there there is something to that as well I don't need anything to come out of this it's an enjoyable experience by the way side note in the comments of the last YouTube video people said something about us not looking at this like looking everywhere and and now I'm recording the camera that's over here like it couldn't be I'm like hey how's it going guys well the problem is I'm looking over here because I want to look at you but my camera's over here and we're not professionals okay people you need it more extreme you need to make it more extreme so that it's clear you know you need to put the camera like behind your head yes but I think it's okay to speak to that person who commented listen I will I'm I'm I'm me and you are learning in real time but at the same time we're human beings like the reason we're human beings we're human beings and the reason why you listen to this show is because you want an inside take from two people who are in the trenches who are sharing how they're feeling you know not filtered and if we're going to if our eyes are all over the place like Sumi my last name is literally Eisenberg what did you expect isenberg oh my God that we got to end it right there do you think that do you think people are going to be able to take actionable okay I want to I want to leave you with one thing I want to so if somebody today let's just pick Noah Kagan as an example somebody wanted to connect with Noah Kagan today but they and they and they'd love to do it within the next three months but they do not have we haven't even talked about the idea of doing free work we're not going to go into that today but they don't have content out there they don't have a social media platform but they would love to work with someone like Noah Kagan Kevin Rose whatever someone who's like influential what would be some actionable steps they could take over the space of two weeks so the first thing is their profile so let's just use Twitter as an example it can't be EMP empty because if you're going to DM and you'd be surprised by the way how many people have open DMS on Twitter I mean my DMs are completely open anyone could message me and I I actually read all of my DMs I don't get back to everyone but I read everyone and I get back to the the mo the most interesting ones so I would say your profile is your you know your calling card is your business card so your bio needs to be super tight your profile picture needs to be there you have to have something you don't want photo yeah gr photo the person should be able to scroll on the timeline and be like some of these things are quite interesting like I connect with some of some of this content so that's step number one and could that just be retweeting other people's stuff if you're not like No it should be the person's own opinions it's pretty lazy it's pretty lazy just to do a straight up RT however doing a quote retweet okay is a different story and actually just if you guys are listening to this and you're like oh easy for you guys to say because there's so many act so much activity I have I have been tweeting only for the last maybe three weeks and I get like one like per tweet like I am I am an example of the opposite of Greg where I don't really have a social media media presence and reaching out to people on Twitter has been so powerful in the last few weeks I'm shocked that I have just not been doing it so you're definitely you don't have to be like it doesn't have to look like people like your stuff for this to work but I guess it does it helps if you have a picture and stuff going on I would recommend that you change your username my one yeah from Jay ice cream I in my mind it was always jce cream so you know no someone here I remember one time somebody met me and they thought thought it was something even worse so wait is my username Jay ice cream I thought that's like just my handle isn't my name Jonathan Courtney on Twitter yeah but if someone if if someone named jream reached out to me and I didn't know who they were I would be I just I would probably report a Spam really report as offensive you looking at my wait so why would it be offensive gice cream is is that like something dirty it's just it's just something I don't want I'm not like waking up on a Monday morning being like you know what I need today J ice cream it's true I actually so my name on Instagram is also J ice cream it's it's actually my Xbox gamer tag which you know I wasn't ever thinking of becoming a business guy and so this was my like making my Xbox account when I was like 12 or something um yeah I don't know if I can change it I love it too much J ice cream the thing is I'm I'm trying to now become successful in spite of my name being J ien okay okay but I'll okay apart from that okay is it okay to have posts which have not many likes that's totally fine as long as your take is interesting and you don't need to create all the content you can just quote retweet someone someone else's tweet and add your opinion on it yes yes that's what I've been trying to do yeah okay so that's step one sorry so that step one is like get yourself and and would you start with one platform like would you start with X I would I would start with X because if you're listening to this you're in you're in the business entrepreneurial Tech world that's where a lot of these people are having these conversations and it's also where you you have the ability to DM a lot of people for free because a lot of people have open DMS even though Twitter's dead right because I heard two years ago that because Elon mus took over its dead so it doesn't exist anymore crazy that you're using it even though it's dead yeah and and I'm not saying that it's the best platform but I am saying that it's a great place to start yeah I I definitely get more responses from people on X than anywhere else yeah so then I would what I would do step two is make a list of the five or 10 people who you want to meet in the next 12 months and set tweet notifications for those people yes okay then do you know the dream 100 concept no okay I'm not going to talk about it now but if anyone wants to figure out how to you can't just well if you want the dream 100 concept is a so you just said like like choose 10 people who you'd want to meet uh and then set notifications for them there's this concept about growing a business where if you want to grow a business one of the best ways to do it is by making a list of the hundred people who have access to the audience that you want and then in that so you have the list it's basically a Google sheet you would create on the left would be the their name then you would have their all of their different social profiles uh and then you would have like you know the amount of people who are following them and then you have like a list of all the things that you think they want so if you're doing this by yourself dream 10 is probably better but you could create a Google doc here where you're also when you're watching all their content you're collecting almost an A A an archive of the things that they're interested in so you're creating your own profile and I'm sure someone will use AI to do it but yeah the the concept of the dream 100 thing is that you have a way then to track all the people you're reaching out to and apparently if you actually reach out to 100 people then maybe 20 30 of the people will respond to you and this is one of the best ways to to get in front of the audience that you actually want to get in front of because you can get on their content Etc um but dream 100 is something you can Google and watch videos about if you want to see like a practical breakdown of even how to decide who you would want to reach out to I didn't want to I just didn't want to take you off track I appreciate that I ALS but I also didn't want you to be the the person who says I have a secret but I'm not telling oh no I just I just didn't want to annoy your audience and they're like Jonathan keeps interrupting you don't be afraid of the YouTube comments man no they're dude your YouTube comments are extremely kind and like constructive honestly it's amazing say that to the camera though say it to the camera look at the camera your YouTube comments are very very constructive and I am responding to almost all of them yeah same here they're awesome so okay step three once you once you've got the list you're going to get a tweet notification from Rivers Cuomo let's say and your job now is to reply as soon as possible but also reply extremely thoughtfully got it you'd be surprised you know you might look at someone like Rivers oh my oh my God this person has 2 million 3 million four million followers there's no way this person's looking at his or her replies no a most people look at their replies and if you say something that is smart some of these people notice it for example on Twitter I notice it's like the same group of people who always reply to my stuff so if someone reaches out to me I'll recognize their profile picture and I'm more likely to have my brain picked or have coffee with that person because I know that they care about my content and they care about startup ideas and they care about all the stuff that I care about so we're like we're Cut From the Same Cloth yeah yeah that makes a lot of sense so you would turn on the post notifications for the people that you would like to get in touch with and every time they post you essentially respond would you also say that like retweeting and then like quote posting I don't even know what it's called like quoting what they did uh would that count as a replying to what they do absolutely cuz then you're spreading their message to other people to my one follower no I I think that's that's right yeah this this definitely I've I've been I'm actually trying to get um I want this guy Aman who used to be the CEO you probably know him I should have just asked you I want him to coach me Aman the X CEO of uh appsumo and uh I've be I'm in his like waiting list and I'm I'm like replying to all of his and I'm jokingly saying yeah it's because I want you to coach me earlier and I'm definitely getting noticed if you know him tell him to coach me so great you know I'll uh call call him up yeah call him up I want to pay him I want to pay him and I can't pay him because he won't let me trying he he has got like a waiting list keep trying no I think this is this strategy is is Fault prooof like you you are able to pretty much meet whoever you want via this strategy and and you don't need hundreds of thousands of followers now you have to be okay with rejection and you have to be okay with silence and that's not easy and you cannot be entitled that's the worst because you also don't know like sometimes someone will reach out to me right um on YouTube or LinkedIn or whatever I'm not on X so much or on Instagram or they'll email the company and they won't get a response from me just because I don't see it and then like a couple coup Weeks Later they'll send me like an angry message I'm like are you [ __ ] serious this is the F that's also now the first time I'm seeing an interaction with this person you know what I mean like that's the thing you got to be you got to be really okay with silence you got when I'm reaching out to when I'm in LA and reaching out to people who are like way above me if they ghost me if they don't respond to me uh the best thing I've ever done is just not pushing and not being irritating and then like the next time I'm there sometimes I meet them and it's just that they were away just don't uh I think that's very important to be very okay with silence and to be very okay with rejection uh and not be entitled because they they might change their mind a couple of years later if you're doing something more interesting I also think it's okay to follow up so for example I'm trying to do you know Colin and Samir do you know who that is of course yeah I know them personally no I don't not at all I do know of them but I don't know them personally at all are you trying to get on their show I know them personally and bastard of course you know them [ __ ] personally of course you do Greg literally knows everyone I want dude I never meet anyone who doesn't know story person that's actually a good story I cold DMD Colin in Samir tell us tell us exactly how it went so I think the way it worked was they tweeted about monetization of their Channel and I replied with an i on how they could monetize their channel so going back to I had tweet notifications for them I replied thoughtfully with an idea for them and I just dm' them after if you ever want to talk more about this my you know hit me up and I arranged a meeting in New York to chat I wasn't in New York I just like flew to New York you know but just were you they were there and you were like oh I'm going to be there anyway or as in you went out of your way to meet them yeah I didn't tell them that but yes correct yeah of course but you you with or without you them you boned them I Bono I boned them big time and it was uh it was a great meeting I was happy I met them it was a very inspirational chat and I was thinking who would be cool to have on the Pod I I thought Samir would be really awesome Colin would be equally as awesome but I I have samir's phone number so I sent him a message April 21st hey love love you to come on my podcast it's a top tech tech podcast not your typical Creator audience because he usually goes on podcasts for Creator so I'm trying to think like how could I how can I how can I get him excited about the podcast and I wrote past guests include Alexis Ohanian Morgan howel Jonathan Courtney Jonathan Courtney Jonathan Courtney Jonathan Court J ice cream from Twitter j i cream j. ice cream and then I I posted uh a tweet of me with when I when Kevin Rose came on so I had the credibility of Kevin Rose and then I was like if that sounds fun let me know it's called the startup ideas pod and then he goes happy to come on but the problem was the my Samir was impossible to schedule with and impossible just impossible so I followed up 1 2 3 4 five 6 seven times and then he just texted me today Fi finalizing a travel schedule by end of day today we'll give you a time tonight but I had to look like an idiot for a lot of times to do it and that's just the the price you pay to do to to use this strategy I have a little hack on maybe maybe something different you could have done there um and you're better at this than me so take this with a pinch of salt Greg's audience um there's someone who I'm so I'm running this Mastermind don't worry I'm not going to sell it on your podcast already sold out I'm running this Mastermind in LA and there's the speaker I wna I want him to speak at it I won't say his name on the podcast right now because I'm still working on it um he agreed like he was like I'm in no problem let's do this um we agreed on everything and then uh he was like I just need to chat with my wife to to make sure that like the dates are good and I didn't get any response then for a little bit and so I followed up and I was like hey just uh you know confirming are you still in blah BL blah I didn't get a response and then so I spent I sent another email just saying uh hey just just checking in and he said oh uh absolutely just I'm still in I'm still excited I just need to really make sure of my wife and then I was like wait a minute this is an opportunity for me to make this this easier for this guy because clearly he's way like he's just got a different life to me this person has way more going on um and and also I want him to speak at my event I actually really need him to speak at my event it would be amazing for him to speak at my event and so I wrote him an email and his response to it was I love that and we'll tell you about the email in the next step no I'm just kidding uh the email I sent him was uh okay how about this the the event is happening anyway and how about 2 weeks beforehand I'll just reach out to you again and see if you want to come so you don't have to think about the scheduling and he was like that was the thing he was super excited about a lot of the things that I noticed about people who are very important and who are kind of higher up in this hierarchy dude they have so I mean the amount of stuff you and I have going on and I mean I am like here in the business world you're here in the business world and maybe Colin in Samir here I don't know Kevin Rose is like in space these people have so much going on it's unimaginable so if you can just make it so easy and they often I think like spontaneous and impromptu ways of doing things so I wonder two things that I would do if I was trying to get this guest on my podcast um and I had a couple of these bigger guests on my podcast before and I had this challenge one is finding out without them even knowing who they assistant is and just going around them and trying to see if I can schedule it with them uh the other thing is literally just having a slot like but but soon like a slot that's happening in the same day and reaching out to them in two weeks and being like hey actually have like a slot today tomorrow the next day in the next 72 hours often I notice that people like this tend to like to do things sort of last minute because it doesn't have to add on to their really chaotic schedule it's just oh just put it in right now as it was today with you right we were chatting we were messaging and I was like how about like today it it just it sometimes works out better when you do these things on a very short scale I have found agreed I think that's a great tip and I think that's a great place to end I I want to see who people end up meeting from this yeah before people start reaching out to you Greg just to make sure you actually remember the things in the episode if you just reach out to Greg and say can I pick your brain nothing's going to happen you know what I mean that's not the that's not the point of this episode like make sure you didn't listen to it on 10x speed there's probably some uh there's probably some bits in here that would help you get in touch with someone like GRE um but yeah dude that's it I hope that's valuable for your audience I think I hope so too I hope so too it's another experiment it's not one of your it's not like a a news topic it's not like a tweet it's like a general thing that I see you doing out in the world uh that I think some of your audience would find valuable well Jonathan I think uh people could follow you atj scream on Twitter give me some likes give me some uh attention out there on J Ice JJ Ice Cream and if you want us to continue doing episodes like this comment on YouTube we are in those comments and subscribe to the YouTube channel and share with all your friends that's all we ask it's not a big ask it's small ask it's not a big ask at all it's barely an ask it's a micro ask it's the only way we know very small barely visible ass it's the only way we know that people are enjoying it cuz if not we'll just we'll stop doing it yeah you know [ __ ] it don't want to do this any yeah if no one likes it we're not doing it yeah exactly that's the lesson here yeah that is the lesson is if no one likes it don't do it we're kidding we're kidding if but I I I will say if a lot of people like this a form of content you want to do more of it so for example like that's how the startup ideas podcast came I started like this podcast was called where it happens before and people were just really resonating when I started talking about startup ideas enter the pivot startup ideas podcast so that's that's the history there yeah I think people should also know that this does not replace the core podcast this is sort of like a like Greg still going to interview people and give you that other stuff you like this is more like a BTS you know behind the scenes of like Greg has a crazy guest on his podcast how does Greg contact these people that's kind of what I was thinking you know like in my mind I was thinking in here great mind I'm trying to like push my temples to show that I'm it's my brain all right man it's been real take care later bye [Music] time baby

and all I could think about is like what other books are selling for $19 $17 on Amazon that could be turned into $500 a month businesses I would say that if you're really passionate about something and it's niche enough then you probably have an unfair advantage to build media if there's one thing that I've learned in the last I don't know 20 years it's that you need to be passionate about like the industry but you might not need to be like so passionate about the exact specific spefic company you work at it's a therapist app that's making like $36,000 a year and he just launched it what are the things I could go test this weekend that aren't go build software into hardware and and scale up manufacturing so I would say go work for someone but at the same time go also be testing what you're learning on the side you know if I had 48 hours to figure out how to make a million dollars and actually love doing it I would probably spend my 48 hours start [Music] Chris Hutchins it's uh not surprising that you're sipping on Kirkland sparkling water you know you alternate between highend and super affordable I'm excited to chat today because you always bring the heat you uh you've got a top podcast all the hacks where you're sharing you let you let people into your mind you're sharing all your financial tips and and you've got a unique mind you've sold a company to Google before you're just you're an interesting guy and interesting people need to need to uh share their ideas yeah I got lots of ideas so we I'm excited to take this to wherever you go all right so what's on what's been on your mind lately okay so I got one thing that's been on my mind and we talked about this for for a moment before so so uh I'll set the stage there's this episode of this podcast called acquired uh about Ultra Luxury premium products and services and where the value of products like goes beyond their utility and it's just got me thinking about this like premium category of creating products that are not Kirkland water but something else so that was like set the backdrop um and then I have a three and a half-year-old okay and I saw this tweet for this product that is like an iPad app to help your kid learn how to read and I was sitting here like oh this is really cool like here's a three-year-old reading my daughter loves books she can't read anything to herself wouldn't it be cool if she could read so I go sign up and it's like do you want to do the 7-Day trial and I'm like this app iPad app 500 bucks a month I do I mean other than like that joke Red Diamond app or what whatever it was back in the day like I have never seen a piece of software for consumers at that price ever I don't know if you have an example of something at that price point but that might be the most expensive piece of consumer software I've seen uh yeah I haven't seen anything like that I know dating apps H have been trending way more expensive like dating apps used to be you know $5 a month $9 a month um Rya I think charges I'm going to pull it up now they're charging 50 bucks a month which is like the Tinder that's more like high-end so to speak so you are seeing that Trend around like people spending $50 a month but $500 a month I haven't seen anything like that it was wild so I'm like okay 7-Day trial why not and we do a 7-Day trial and the the quality of the app is like pre-alpha in terms of visuals right like I was looking at on iPhone some of the buttons are missing there's basically I think 20,000 games or something but they so far in the first 150 we've done there's like seven games right and the games are very very basic visually everything however my daughter is learning to sound words like here's the crazy thing it doesn't take this beautiful app that's perfectly designed to do anything and but fundamentally it was working like I sat down with my daughter yesterday and she's like sat and I'm like wait you just read a word like prior to today you haven't read words you could identify characters and letters but you couldn't read a word now you read a word and we're like one week into this app and I'm like this is insane well it both works but like $500 a month and so I saw someone post on Twitter like this is crazy you're charging so much money and the guy's like well then just buy this book on Amazon and it's the exact same as our thing you could just do it yourself and I was like okay so I bought the book on Amazon right $500 a month $17 book and I look at the book and the book is literally like do this exercise with your kid and it's the same exercise as the app and if I were a developer I feel like maybe I could just build this app you know like I'm not I don't want to diminish how much work they've done to create 20,000 exercises but when you use it it it creates this feeling of this is so simple why would I pay $500 for it because I feel like I could do it even though I'm sure it's way way harder I even did a video call with one of their product managers like there's a lot that goes into it however it works and the only alternative is do I want to sit down for 30 40 minutes a day every single day and like create the exercises with paper and pencils and my hands or do I want to pay $500 a month and all I could think about is like what other books are selling for $19 $17 on Amazon that could be turned into $500 a month businesses for people who just don't want to do the work and want an easier more gamified version of it right like look at du lingo uh Rosetta Stone like all these language learning products they are also pretty expensive um I think dual lingo is probably actually not or it used to be free but there's a paid version but I feel like Rosetta Stone all these things like hundreds of dollars for software that isn't like Rya where like there's a community of other people you know it's infinitely scalable you could have a hundred million users um or not so I don't know I haven't gone down this path yet but I it had me thinking I'm curious what comes to mind for you like are there other learning related things where there's books like How to illustrate right like you want to teach your kid to draw or you want to learn to draw well there's this discrepancy between how much does it cost for a professional to do a thing with me like a tutor and that was their argument was like how much does it cost to have a tutor come to your house for 30 minutes a day 365 days a year well it's probably going to cost you $5,000 a month so in a way we're super cheap and then I was like oh personal training and everyone seems to be you know like I'm wondering what tweaks you could add to make it feel more like the tutor which would get my head wrapped around the price H because right now it just feels like it should be a $ Five Doll app even though it's worth more I don't know that's something on my mind I like the prompt which is what are other apps that we can build that we can charge $500 a month for that actually helps people get from point A to point B based on proven tried and tested Knowledge from things like books and I think the like the framework I would have to to go after ideating something like this is I would start with kids because kids is such a good market like people are willing to spend $500 a month on kids and lesso $500 a month on themselves unless it helps them get a date I.E Rya um so I'm I'm kind of thinking like okay what are all the Milestones that kids have you know and you're just like you you you write that down in a notebook you literally write down all the different things like you know spelling and writing their first word and saying their first word and all all the things and you try to think about Lear math learning a language Lear like go through all the courses all of them all of them and you just you unbundle them into these separate apps and you take advantage of ASO App Store optimization um so that when people put in the App Store like you um you know learn whatever we end up creating an app around let's say it's uh doing math that you come up first and I think you know it's one of the reasons why I actually rename this podcast from where it happens to the startup ideas podcast was so that when people would type in on Spotify startup ideas or on YouTube startup ideas I would come up first it's literally like people are making fun of the name change I was like yeah I I know it's really like obvious it's it's obvious because I want people to search ideas and for me to come up so I think like an ASO angle to this is is kind of how I think about it quick ad break let me tell you about a business I invested in it's called boring marketing.com so a few years ago I met this group of people that were some of the best SEO experts in the world they were behind getting some of the biggest companies found on Google and the secret s is they've got a set of technology and AI that could help you outrank your competition so for my own businesses I wanted that I didn't want to have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I didn't want to depend on ads to drive customers to my businesses I wanted to rank high in Google that's why I like SEO and that's why I use boring marketing.com and that's why I invested in it they're so confident in their approach that they offer a 30-day Sprint with 100% money back guarantee who who does that nowadays so check it out highly recommend boring marketing.com you know what's funny when you just said that I was like I didn't even think to look are there other apps doing this that are like better and I just looked and like du lingo of course funny funny thing has an app for kids called learn to read 100% free designed by experts to teach your kids how to read now I'm immediately going to download this and test it out and see how it compares the thing that changed everything was like they gave us a trial and and you could see progress in a week so maybe this I don't want to be it's like app store optimization and first first s day or first three- day optimization it's like there have to be ways that you can convince someone to show them progress in minutes um and that was the thing that this did so well that I'm like oh do I do I want to go try du lingo like is it going to have the same effect if I if I use the Dual app and I don't see progress in like 20 minutes I'm like this is garbage you know like I also think there's just there's an opportunity an opportunity to be the anti- dualingo you know what I mean so like it's okay that dualingo is doing this because a lot of people I mean dualingo is massive at this point like I think multi-billion dollar company and a a lot of people are like yeah I tried dualingo like I tried dualingo for Spanish and I gave up like there's millions of us you know there's more there's more Giver ERS like me uh than there are people who succeeded on language learning apps like dualingo so I think if you can just brand it and position it as like we are the app like we're experts in uh and you know who did this actually really well uh I invested actually in their company synthesis have you heard of synthesis no check it out synthesis. comom so it's a really interesting uh story and I think a lot of startups could learn a lot for how they position so they're founding story Elon mus asked me to start an experimental school with him at SpaceX in 2014 the goal was to develop students who are enthralled by complexity and solving for the unknown synthesis offers the most Innovative learning experiences from that school they're designed to cultivate student voice strategic thinking and collaborative problem solving I believe synthesis builds these skills like no other educ ational experience until Rec recently synthesis was only available to a handful of SpaceX families today our community is worldwide and growing quickly so really cool idea they've got this synthesis tutor where it says they've partnered with these researchers to make the first superhuman math tutor that actually works for kids five years and older and it's $29 a month says on their website said 10,000 plus kids use it and I think what's really cool about it is you're like as a parent you're like whoa so Elon Musk like this is good if this is good enough for Elon musk's kids it's good enough for mine there's something really interesting about I mean the way they they don't push this but the mava thing that was so interesting was like it's super premium right I knew it going in that it was going to be super premium but I could get a free trial for seven days and then they're like you know what take 30 more days and you know you can re get a full refund so you get 37 days and I'm like I might as well like get this thing that cost 500 it's like get a tutor to come to your house for the day and this is a common practice uh it's funny I I didn't put these dots together but there's a gymnastics place in the on the peninsula and they're like bring your kid in for a free class right and then your kid goes and you're like wow my kid's learning uh now I want to keep doing and so this like get your kid to learn something show them how good it can be and and rinse and repeat it all I mean I I hope we're allowed to go down tangents but it makes me think of two things this company I invested in a while ago called camble which is online English classes with English speakers so most people listening to this don't know this product because they probably speak English because if they didn't speak English it would be tricky to listen to this conversation um but they created these like remote learn English platforms uh and then the other one is this company called fitter I don't know if you know this company it's uh it's online personal trainers so what this kind of makes me think about is like the accountability is the hard part right is for a lot of learning like why du lingo didn't work for you but if you had a tutor come in your house to teach you Spanish for 30 minutes every day you probably wouldn't have dropped off as much and when I saw fitter it was basically personal trainers but all the personal trainers are in India and I don't know doesn't really but so the cost of living is so low that it ended up looking like it was going to be like $5 a month or something it was some astronomically low cost for a person who speaks English to FaceTime you and and work out with you and show you tell you what to do and motivate you and push you whatever you need but they brought the cost so far down by putting people getting people from other countries um who speak your language not just not just a person coming it's India's like where yoga comes from yes so they know yoga better than us funny enough this was for like strength cardio so uh yoga would make even more sense I was looking at this for like they do Fitness and Nutrition but like you know I know so many people that want a personal trainer and say it's too expensive well okay why do you need your personal trainer to be here right like what other models are there like why do you need your language tutor to be here like we've already done this with all the outsourced kind of EAS and and you see a lot of more Outsourcing around different creative talents happening now and I don't know in This Global Workforce of people all around the world at different costs of living what other opportunities are there here for things um I've once thought uh this is is a little bit of a crazy idea but we have cameras like over the kids cribs so it's like you know kid wakes up in the middle of the night are they okay wake up check the camera like you could probably have some service to parents that are like hey I sleep really heavy I'm not going to hear my kid wake up put a alarm on my phone that you can sound off and have someone in a remote place watch the video all night you know like there's just like with between cameras and sensors and lowcost labor and fast internet I just feel like there's like millions of ideas like for this if we were doing an inperson podcast we have a remote producer in a much cheaper cost of living who dials in and uh I have a video switcher in our that you can control online so someone could literally control the video switcher choose which channels Slide the levels for the audio and video and not be here at all now we're way off from where we started by the way like this is like the power of uh just going down rabbit holes of brainstorming and coming up with cool ideas it's like I don't know there's so many I think the so yes we are we are in din rabbit hole and that's okay I want like I my goal is to be in rabbit holes with you because I think I just want to unpack the prompts and and and the Frameworks behind it so one of the really interesting things you said is okay we've got this Global Workforce we've got things like AI we can bring people in um to do you know teach us things or or you know remote experiences a a prompt I have for myself is okay if in India the world's best yoga teachers are there what are you know how do you go through every country and be like what is this group of people known for so you know the best you know I'm Canadian the best hockey players probably come from Canada you know is there a way to teach you know hockey remotely in some in some way or create a product that could teach it um and it doesn't necessarily everything doesn't need to necessarily be around teaching it could also be like doing things right like maybe the best editors live in a particular country and of course I don't want to like generalize and everything but like you kind of have to generalize a little bit you be like all right I'm staking the claim the best hockey payers are coming come from Canada or the people who know best quality of life are from France or something you know like teaching manners by people in England I don't know I'm making things up but I think that's a really interesting prompt for for thinking about uh how to how to how to create an experience around remote Talent I'm just thinking when you said hockey I don't play hockey or golf but I was like Wow imagine you've seen these drones that follow people now right um imagine if you could for the purpose of learning right you had a hockey stick and a hockey puck and they were both like somehow connected to sensors I one time did this golf lesson where we like analyzed our swing right and it was done with cameras but you could probably also do it with sensors and now imagine I'm like in my you know the lake behind my house or something or some practice ice and I could literally have someone watching me and watching the analytics on the devices I'm using and be and like in an airpod being like all right I need you to Archer back a little bit more and they could be doing this from anywhere in the world they could you know without having to be where I am and paying rents in the Bay Area and you know it would be great for everyone totally now I'm like what other where is there like I think what's changed is the ability to get all this information right like the fact that you couldn't see me here I'm at a computer that's one thing but small version I could put up a tripod and like go to the batting cages and I could probably get a and put an airpod in and someone could coach me on my my baseball swing and it's funny cuz uh our neighbors who have kids that are all three boys are into baseball and he's like this one of the best batting coaches is down in San Jose so they drive like an hour to San Jose for this batting coach to do like a batting lesson and I'm just like I don't know why didn't need to drive to San Jose like it seems like such you know like and why why does that batting coach need to have such a big yard that he can have a batting cage back there why why don't you just bring him with you and schedule a lesson out of place tot I actually literally had this issue like two days ago so I want to I I live in South Florida a lot of people play golf and I don't play golf and it's gotten to the point where I was invited to play golf with and one of the people who I was invited to play golf in a for Sim and Michael Jordan was one of the people in the forsome and I actually said no to it and I said no to it why because it's Michael Jordan if I don't you know I'm not gonna like I don't want to slow down Michael Jordan playing golf so I was like you know what this gives me the kick kick in the butt to actually learn to play golf and I Googled like golf classes or golf coaches and the PGA actually has a professional Golf Association actually has a list of people who they recommend in your area and I reached out to this person who who actually coaches a bunch of pro golfers and he was like I'm not driving 40 minutes to you and I was like fair but I'm also not driving 40 you know 40 minutes to you um so I I think there's something really smart here about Hardware like how do you create these spaces like I don't know if it's a golf simulation Zone um but something like that and incorporate people in other areas of course I don't want to pay someone who lives in Miami me who's super expensive but you know I would pay someone in Japan where you know $1 us is $160 n now and there's a huge currency Arbitrage trying to think of all the use cases for I mean there's just unlimited number here's a funny one and this is even easier I was trying to set up these cameras for a interview and I was like I just have some questions and this platform has failed every time there's so many companies that have started this I'm curious if if you think now anything's different like connect me with an expert for an amount of money that is you know smaller than you know they would normally make for like a house call so I was like there is a person that knows how to dial in the settings on a Sony camera and I the spectrum is like hire a video producer for a few hours that's going to cost hundreds and hundreds of dollars or thousands of dollars or watch YouTube videos and I still and maybe you have to do it in a niche maybe you don't but I haven't seen this work I remember multiple startups trying to do this where it's like you know you have an electric question you know you could pay $10 and ask your electric question I feel like sometime this is going to be solved like there is a person out there who would like to make $50 to spend five minutes answering these questions and I just don't know where they are who they are or how to connect with them yeah so I I actually forgot about that but about almost 10 years ago now when mobile is starting to take off there was a bunch of venture-backed companies I'm blanking on the names of them that was like ask a question and you're going to get an answer from experts and you have to pay for it do you remember the names of them I don't but I remember one and I even think Google launched one was an experiment yes they did they absolutely did and that was like help Google helpouts is what it was called oh yeah and Facebook even launched one didn't didn't Facebook launch one Google is shutting down helpouts in 5 yeah this exactly that and it failed exactly that's what it was and there was also a bunch of venture-backed ones that like they were just copying these Venture back startups but there was something so amazing about that idea I can ask a question and get like a real answer now fast forward to 2024 and you have Chad gbt for that so you could ask a question and you have ai that answers it that being said we're not you know a plumber is better than chat GPT right now uh in terms of asking some Plumbing questions would you agree uh yes and no there I actually had a couple Plumbing questions in the last few weeks and I would have I wish there was a does chat PD have a good way to search your history or do you just have to scroll to find to scroll uh your thing but I actually asked a few Plumbing questions and I was very surprised at how good the answer was but I had some follow-up questions that it was terrible at but the initial I was surprised at how much cuz uh my father-in-law builds homes and is just kind of like one of the people who just generally like knows everything about homes and Electric and Plumbing and so I was like should I call him I'm GNA ask Chad gbd first and I was like I got I got my answer um and then I did go down a rabbit hole of watching some YouTube videos that I didn't that was like wow now we're now we're in the weeds and I probably could have saved some time but electricians I think is the one where I've tried and failed and you've tried on chat gbt and you and yeah yeah here's my take after after going down this rabbit hole on this on this concept I think chat gbt and its competitors when it comes to like figuring out an answer and getting data on a question it's only getting better and better and they're going to win when it comes to education and experiences that's where people will prevail um because if I want someone to teach me how to play guitar there needs to be a certain amount of taste I think and also I'm I you talked about accountability I will feel more accountable to another person than I will to a robot always yeah every time so I mean I don't know if you saw the other day but uh levels levels uh Peter levels that's his name he launched um therapist AI where I can see that yeah and it's you know a lot of people hate it a lot of people don't like it at all but because they're saying like you can't just like say that you're laun you know there's an AI powered therapist because like you go to school to be a therapist and you get training to be a therapist um so yeah he he caused some controversy there but the um what he showed also on Twitter if you check his Twitter he showed what it would look like right now it just looks like chat GPT with you know you're basically talking to chat GPT that's what it looks like but in the future you'll be a he has like almost like an avatar it looks like a real person and you can hear um and we'll put it in the YouTube clip but you can hear uh um what your therapist is saying and like it feels like you're talking to a therapist but it still feels like you're talking to a 3D character interesting yeah it's CBD CBT do chat I think what is that I'm not sure no I'm trying to find this thing but it's not it's not therapist. but I think it's maybe it's hold on let me pull it up it is therapist ai.com okay okay and is that what it is oh there we go it's Al yeah it CBT do chat is the same URL okay but therapist ai.com is better it's a telegram app yeah that's even crazier and I'm sure this is to get around making this as a telegram app makes me think this probably isn't something that's licensed and and legal to do exactly but I love it it's a therapist app that's making like $36,000 a year and he just launched it like ARR that's amazing yeah there's so many ways to combine this but I agree the for me I don't think I the accountability is really important but I also wonder how much we can get to a place where that accountability is virtual like you get a text message did you work out today you know you get a text message like in French asking you a question and you have to reply to it and and it's all all virtual it's all you know AI I wonder if you can replace that accountability without having a phone call but also I don't know if you did that demo recently where it was like a call center you could like set up a basically a dentist appointment call center with AI and you would like call and make an appointment and it sounded like a person and they were actually listening and responding to you and it was pretty crazy yeah and I think I I it's obviously going to put a lot of people at a job customer service job I I just rented a car I just gave a back a car this morning I was renting it uh for a couple days and as I'm leaving it was an Enterprise as I was leaving an Enterprise the woman I could tell that the woman at the cash was like having a bad day and she just lost her mind on someone else and basically she was like I'm not going to give you a car like B oh here's what happened so woman was sitting in the chair customer was like I've been waiting here for an hour she's in nurse Garb and she was like I need to get to the hospital I have my shift and you told me you were going to get me a car an hour ago and I still don't have it and she goes I'm not giving you a car and she was like what do you mean you're not giving me a car it's not your decision like I booked it um and then the woman the nurse goes listen I I understand you're having a bad day but like you have to give me a car and then she goes I I'll give you a car if I want to give you a car robots won't do that yeah so yeah robots aren't gonna have bad days they might glitch and give you a helicopter instead of a car exactly um but yeah it's uh it's going to be interesting to see how actually I um I was looking at these two services is there two um sound mixers and one of them actually has some type of intelligence built into it so let's not call it AI yet but they were like hey this one's better for beginners because you can basically just start talking into the microphones and it will just like Auto calibrate everything for you and I was like well this is cool like imagine when you're buying Hardware like a camera that instead of like the Sony Auto you could tell it something be like oh recording a podcast like it used to always be choose a setting but if it could just adapt and say oh it looks like you're shooting a podcast so we just changed all of these things um like the Sony thing has like Auto and manual there's not and then sometimes there's like in the Middle where it's like I'm shooting a child but there are too many scenarios to have like 7,000 sliders where you're like let me scroll down to in-person podcast with three people you know at night in a room with you know well-lit you know professional lights um and you'll just start to bake all this into Hardware but that's not really an I mean there are some people listening who can go build that yeah if I were listening I'm not going to go build that totally uh so I'm trying to think what are the things I could go test this weekend that aren't go build Hardware go build software into hardware and and scale up manufacturing so what is that I mean Chris like you could build anything um you have 48 hours you have real not Noah Kagan question here yeah exactly we had exactly you have you have 48 hours to make a million dollars how do you do it I'm G to challenge The Prompt a little because I'm like well yes you didn't say I have to make the million dollars today I just have to kick something off that's going to make a million dollars if there's one thing that I've learned in the last I don't know 20 years it's that it's very hard to keep doing something for more than a couple years if you don't really really like it so for a while I just thought I was unemployable because I had a series of I had a series of jobs in a row that I just didn't like and I was like oh maybe I don't like jobs but I never really like took the time to figure out what I liked doing and I think that's really hard so you know if I had 48 hours to figure out how to make a million dollars and actually love doing it I would probably spend my 48 hours trying to figure out what kinds of things I enjoy doing because I'm not going to be able to get to to that million dollars uh if I don't have the longevity like some people are going to do it overnight right but most people it's going to take years and so kind of experimenting with that and I maybe I'd spend some of that time like interviewing my friends and you know my spouse about what makes me tick sometimes like seeing things in yourself is really hard when I started a podcast about life optimization it was so funny every single person I knew was like well of course you did and I was like what do you mean of course I did why didn't you tell me that 20 years ago it took me 20 years to come to this career that 20 years ago probably would have you know would have loved but I didn't realize it I didn't put the pieces together but I imagine if I'd taken the skills that I had as a product manager interviewing customers and asking questions trying to figure out the five y's what if I just appli that to myself and Ed like my peers and friends and you know colleagues and family as my customer research panel could I arrive at things about what I'm uniquely qualified to do what I'm passionate about that would have been harder for myself maybe I could just use an AI therapist and be like help me figure out like imagine if I went through chat GPD help me figure out what I'm good at ask me questions until we you know come up with a business idea that would be something I would love doing AI might be actually pretty good at that so when we were growing up everyone told us do what you're passionate right did you did you get that advice you must be a little younger but I feel like somewhere slightly after I graduated college I'm about to turn 40 so somewhere slightly after I graduated college I feel like that was happening but I don't feel like that was the message yet in the Zeitgeist of like me looking for my first job because I mean my first job I was looking for a job at like an investment bank because I was like that's the most like amazing job you can get out of college it certainly wasn't that I was passionate about it it was like that's the best job um so but I will say in the years that followed that seemed to be the norm everyone's like go pursue your passion do the thing your pass I don't know if I totally I think it's good to know your passion but like that doesn't mean it can be your job tomorrow well here I'll challenge that a bit so here's my take I am yeah I'm 35 so I'm 5 years young you know five years younger and when I was growing up that was the prevailing wisdom do it do it you're passionate and and everything will work out and the reality is then the you know great financial crisis hit a lot of us couldn't get jobs and the the reality is it wasn't true like it turns out that if you're passionate about some you know Niche Niche topic it you know you can't make money during you know doing it now fast forward to today I I would say that if you're really passionate about something and it's niche enough you can't just be like I'm passionate about sports you can't just no that's a cop out answer um then you probably have an unfair advantage to build media so create a podcast create videos go on YouTube whatever and if you can do that then you can attract an audience and if you can attract an audience then all the next step is you have to be passionate about learning how to build stuff so basically I think everyone should become a product manager in that sense what is a product manager I don't mean like I know you're you're thinking like Google product manager and there's like 40 layers of YY I mean like a product owner forget product manager product owner like a builder a builder exactly a builder so if you had going back to the question if you had 48 hours wouldn't you just try to figure out what you're really passionate about and then try to come up with like how am I going to create content AKA media that's going to attract as many people as possible and then figure it out from there I think it depends where like I actually reflected a lot on this with my own podcast I don't think it would be where it is today if I had launched it with the same type of Interest 20 years ago not because of the market like you know if I could freeze myself in a time machine and launch it you know the same day I launched the podcast except I'm now launching it with you know 20 years less experience if you will I don't think it would have been the same I think there were a lot of lessons along the way that enabled it to be more successful and so I would say you know you could try it but I would not like throw in the towel on getting real experience building at some other company before you you know just commit to a life of your passion as a project I also think you know it took me a while to realize actually what that passion is is my passion um you know deals no is my passion like breaking some system down and figuring out how it works maybe we're getting closer but you could argue people knew me for you know deals and points and miles and all that stuff but if you told me to go create social media Clips it would have been a disaster like I didn't like even though I'm passionate about a topic doesn't mean that the medium is right and so the only way that I kind of came to podcasts was I tried out all these different mediums in another part of my life running a business and realized that there is one that I felt like I was more comfortable during so maybe it's like test out all the mediums over the weekend figure out the areas you're interested in but if you're really interested in personal finance right you could start a podcast you could write a newsletter you could build a spreadsheet template like it's it's more Niche than even the category it's like let's say you're really into sports okay we already said two wide now you're really into sports cards right you could go become a sports card Trader or you could build a model that allows you to analyze sports cards and sell that model like sell a spreadsheet you've built like I've done this now by the time this airs I will have launched two versions of a a spreadsheet that I built um so that's very different than creating a podcast right and like that might be you so you got to figure out like what is the thing you like doing and the thing the topic and the process so if you like building companies if you like hiring and managing people if you like you know coding if you like uh talking sharing it could be anything and I'd pick one of those and and start to do it but even the best on lots of these channels spent years how many videos did like Mr Beast produce before any of them took off like a thousand mkb mkdh same thing like the T time it takes to commit to the platform for almost everyone that doesn't already have some audience is so long that I would say find your p passion and pursue it while you're getting tangible real skills that can pay your bills because like chances are that side project with is not going to is not going to be that right away there are people that are not going to listen and those are the people that are probably going to go build the crazy thing so you know that's great but for the average person I think it's not going to happen overnight in 48 hours like Noah kagan's million dollar weekend is like you know it's not build a company that's doing a million dollars of Revenue it's like valid an idea and I had I had an interesting conversation with Andy rackliffe who started Benchmark Capital One of the best returning Venture funds of all time and then went on to start wealth front and he was saying you need to be passionate about like the industry but you might not need to be like so passionate about the exact specific company you work at so find a thing that you love and let someone else pay for you to go deep on it if you're really passionate about hockey go get some job related to hockey while you're thinking about your side projects because there's a lot about whatever industry you want to work in that I think you will unlock by getting more experience I'm sure all the uh I'm sure all the follow your dreams and don't don't go get a full-time job people are hating this but I think there is a a ton of value I picked up from you know 15 or so years of working at companies that made my thing feel easier than it actually was I get it but if you were going to you know if you were going to be building media today meaning if you're going to pick a niche and go after it where where do you think would be interesting you know niches to go after like where's the biggest opportunities right now as we're recording this to be building content like what type of media what topics topic oh so topics not platform exactly topics okay um well I think I think we just established that the topic really just has to be something that you can provide a unique perspective on that is the most valuable thing so if you pick a topic like I could tell you o I think there's a really big opportunity in you you know childhood education but you have no experience with kids and no interest in it it's kind of irrelevant right like um whereas if that's your thing you could go build an Empire like Emily Oster and Becky Kennedy have in that space like there's a lot of opportunities so here's where one where like the answer to that question is actually pursue your passion right like go become an expert with a unique perspective on a thing whether those are hot takes or deep analysis or you know access to other Minds I don't think that matters but it has to be an area that I think is somewhat uncovered and I think given the current nature of media it has to be smaller and smaller right like I have a friend who's launching a micro course and I was like okay this is super interesting because I you know like you you want to talk about micro course this guy's launching a course on how to use miles and points to go to Japan like it's not here's a course on credit cards it's not here's a course on redeeming your points it is a course Point course on how to redeem your points to go to Japan and I think that right now search algorithms and content Discovery is getting better and better and better such that you it's going to be really hard to break through if you're like trying to be Broad in some topic but if it's like I'm going to make hockey videos on you know how the stick should connect with the puck I mean someone listen that plays more hockey he's like that's not about it's about the Arc of your AR I don't know but like that's going to do better than like I'm just G to have a hockey show you know like maybe it's the I'm gonna have a show that's really only relevant for the first year you're learning to play hockey after that don't even listen like this is who that's for and maybe you have your audience grows up with you and you take them on that journey and now three years from now it's something different because you're someone different but I was just so excited when this this friend of mine instead of trying to launch one of a thousand courses on how to use your points in Miles he's like I am launching redeemed miles for Japan and redeem miles for the Maldives those are his two courses yeah so I think it it goes back to outcomes like mapping out all the different outcomes and mini outcomes of particular topic area and Niche and then creating unique content that's packaged well and you can't lose doing that and I want to talk about one more thing related to that because I always had a conversation with uh Dicky Bush and Nicholas Cole so they they have a bunch of courses they do millions of dollars a year in the writing space so they have something called chip 30 for 30 and PGA professional ghost Writing Academy and they've done really really well and one time I remember asking Cole who's your competition are you worried about your competition he says the only slice I want to own is start writing there's going to be a ton of other content around writing online and writing and writing books and no no no I just want to focus on start writing actually he said start writing online if you wantan to if you want to be a person who doesn't write online and you want to get to writing online you come to us and I think that was such a smart way of putting it because yeah to your point it's like almost like it feels mini but it's it's it's not yeah and and if there's an area that you want to get bet like here's a great example of this isn't necessarily a startup idea but maybe it is there are a lot of people out there who have audiences that are terrible at or or don't even participate in certain verticals so if you're like I've realized that hockey and writing is my Niche okay well you want to get some experience doing hockey and writing why not find a hockey Creator who's big and has a huge audience and does no writing and just go get the Reps in like I think that one of the things that I was listening to an episode of all-in and chamath was describing how he thought he had an opportunity to go work at apple and this is after Facebook like has enough money that doesn't need a job and he's he's like I would drop anything to go work uh for Steve Jobs at Apple like learning this thing like he was one of those people that's like I don't care about going back to the drawing board for my career to get an opportunity to do this thing and I think it's a trait of many successful people and it's funny it came up in my interview with Andy he's like this guy was always defending wealthfront from trolls on the internet and he had no experience in product or anything but he loved the wealth front product and Andy reached out to him he's like you're always talking about wealth front I just wanted to get to know you and then he was like I would love to work at wealthfront he's like I don't have any tangible skills he's like come do product support and it's like our customer support function and if you crush it there we'll find a home and this guy went from product support to product to another company where he became the VP of product that had a billion plus dollar outcome and had a super successful career in product but he was willing to take his probably like I don't know manager senior manager level role at another industry and reset to do customer support for two years so that he could get the Reps in at a kind of company he wanted to work at and and I think people just don't they want to skip that path and it's so hard to skip that path so I'm not doing a lot with social media if someone was like I am super passionate about social media and I love your content was like can I help with this area most successful people it's not like you have to do it for free like I don't think gone are the days of like go be a unpaid intern hopefully any successful business that's sees value in your skills are willing to pay you but you might not own the brand but but you'd get to test your skills at scale and I think that is something I would encourage anyone who is trying to get into content creation it's an alternative path yes you could go start your own newsletter or you could go find someone who has a not great newsletter in an area you're passionate about and ask to run it and by the way there are multiple creators I know who I've realized this has happened to them and they set up really lucrative deals like you come over take over my YouTube channel and you can keep 30% of the revenue from YouTube or something like deals like that where you're bringing someone in to own a vertical and giving them real upside so yeah You Don't Own 100% of the upside of a newsletter that you would start but you might own 30% of the upside of a newsletter that has a massive audience that you can start with and if that works it's not like there's only ever going to be one newsletter in a topic right like you go leave and start your own thing uh so I think you have a lot of opportunities and obviously find the right person to work with but I don't know I feel like there's something cool there what do you think I feel like you would say no go start your own thing don't go work for someone else I I would say both like go work for someone because you can do things at scale and test at scale and there's especially in Social specifically social and product you know when you when you launch a new feature to millions of people or hundreds of thousands of people you really pay attention to what that product is is and if it's dialed versus you're just putting it to potentially no one or same with social like you're tweeting to a million people versus just tweeting to 100 people like you really you really instinctively over time learn about how to connect with people and you can take that in the future and and apply that to your own products so I would say go work for someone but at the same time go also be testing what you're learning on the side yeah I think that's fair there's a really cool example um Ben Wilson was the producer for my first million for a b a long time and he had his own podcast called how to take over the world and so on his own on the side he's building this podcast it was really great but also he wanted to learn how to like work inside of a podcast that was operating at a lot greater scale and was a great producer and his show got mentioned and referenced like dozens of times on my first million which aggressively grew the audience on his show because it turns out growth is hard but if you have really high quality content like you can land really cool big growth like step functions that will make it possible now he's on his own doing his own thing um I think he's also turned his production role into an outsourced like agency business where he'll help other people do production um in that newsletter example it's like find a Creator that's doing not doing newsletters about an area you're passionate about go help them spin up a newsletter function figure out how that works then reach out to other creators and be like we'll help you spin up a newsletter function now you've got this agency business now you've been able to promote your own newsletter about your own thing you love now you've got you know three streams of revenue for a project that started out as something that's a side hustle and now you can afford to leave one of them if you don't want to I love it Chris we went down a lot of rabbit holes today as expected this is the most messy episode we've ever done but it is filled with gold filled with gold we you know there's probably like seven 10 startup ideas you know meaning of life and we didn't even go down the path I texted you about which was like this uh Mass affluent market so I feel I feel like I'll challenge people to think about that too well give me give us you're going to have to come on another time but give us uh give us one last startup idea around that macro Trend yeah so what's interesting is mercury which is a bank for businesses recently launched a bank for consumers Mercury Personal Banking and they charge $240 a year and everyone I know oh you got look at that you got a book I got a iPhone case um I thought it was interesting how do they choose which promotional product to send people which marketing thing uh but what was crazy was nobody pays for banking like that's not a thing that ever really existed but they realized that there was this Gap in the market between what serves High net worths and what serves the average customer and the needs in the middle weren't being met and so they said look people who are in this like Mass affluent bucket where they have disposable income maybe they're making a couple Investments here or there like they understand the value of earning yield on their money but they also o want a premium product experience because they're a little younger they're digital native kind of millennial gen Z but also they need to send some wires and there wasn't really anything in the market for them and people are willing to pay now in the long run do they end up lowering the interest rate enough to make it free because people just hate annual fees maybe like I think that's possible but finding a a place in the market to serve something in between I think think is really really interesting and it seems like there's always the cheap end and the super expensive end and I feel like there's going to be more products and services targeting the kind of mass affluent group of people which would be like maybe it's like just another way to say upper middle class or lower upper class I don't know like but like you know enough disposable income that they'll spend $250 a year on their bank or they'll spend you know not me today but they'll spend like uh you know $2 for water right like it's a little bit of a branding thing but for water maybe that's not the right example because it's certainly not the feature Set uh but if you can build a premium feature set you can charge for it and I wonder how many Industries have been erased for the bottom where building something a bit more premium might differentiate like I I feel like there will be a service if Uber hadn't built Uber Lux and Uber black someone could have come in and done something like that um that's probably a bad example because the scale you need to build something is uh like uber is not there but what I I challenge people to think what industries have become such a race for the bottom that there's a big hole in the middle well yeah I think what what you can do you know going back to the how do you make a million dollars in 48 hours is like I would look at uh not the biggest SAS apps but the SAS apps doing between a million dollars a year and $40 million a year um and say okay who is this targeting is this for everyone so is this like the Zoho which is like the Costco of SAS or is this the higher higher end which is like a you know it might not feel like high-end but HubSpot is like a higher end product uh it's like more expensive or Salesforce it's more expensive and then could I create something that's like premium and I think a big part of it is also like signaling I don't know if you disagree with me but I think you know a lot of people like to say oh I don't you know I don't use uh Chase or I don't use Wells Fargo I use mercury I think that's a big I feel the same way about super oh really tell me more about that email so I mean they did this like email was free free free Gmail's free Yahoo's free everybody's launching free email and they're like look we're not going to do the email we're just going to be interface for it and it's going to be better and it's $30 a month and people are like you want me to pay for email and they're like why don't you use it for a month and you use it and you're like [ __ ] this is amazing like superhuman I I've been trying to get them to be a sponsor of the show because I'm like such a big fan and it took me two years finally happened um but it just makes email so much better and in that use case it's almost like they took Enterprise features and applied them to Consumers which I think the more people become you know multi- income multi- job the more we're going to be treating ourselves like businesses and so tools like Mercury which is basically like I want business banking for myself I want business email for myself um I think there's just going to be an endless number of products and services that become more like something that was Enterprise SAS for consumers and superhumans just I don't know do you superhuman or do you pay for email or do you I'm surprised that you pay for email honestly I'm shocked I mean you're drinking Kirkland you're sipping on Kirkland uh sparkling water so here's the thing I genuinely think I can get through I think I probably can save 30 minutes a day on email with how many emails do you get a day let's call it 200 see that seems like a lot of email I feel like I don't get that much email and you're including like a newsletter that kind of stuff I guess I probably get like a 100 emails a day yeah okay so all the little things that you can do from like quickly responding like the instant intro this is like for someone like you and I it's like my favorite feature someone emails as like hey imagine I get an email from you hey Chris I want to connect you with my friend Ted and I'm like in one keyboard shortcut it pops up and says Greg thanks Greg to BCC hi Ted moves Greg to BCC moves Ted to the two field um all automatically I use all Snippets I don't know I am uh I'll give it a shot I'll give it a shot and you definitely if you or anyone else alth hacks.com superhuman first month free I worked hard to get them to become a sponsor so check it out no I'll use that I'll check that out um and they do on the premium thing one thing they do that's really smart is when you sign up I bet you'll get an email for scheduling like a session for them to like train you on it and I just think it's so valuable for lockin to like teach your customers how to use your product better um I think notion is a product that doesn't do like I I have so many people I know that love notion but they don't know how to use it and so there's this whole Marketplace of templates I have a a no-brainer business idea we'll end on this where if someone wants to do it hit me up at Greg Eisenberg um on Twitter okay it's an agency that basically does these onboarding calls for companies so you approach a notion and you you know you hire some of the old let's say superhuman onboarding Specialists and stuff like that so you create this team this customer support team and you go to yeah let's say notion you say like hey today you're no you're not doing these like onboarding calls we'll do it for you we're going to manage the process end to endend we're going to learn everything about your product we're going to make amazing we have this like special method for how we go about doing it and you're going to see a lift of retention and how much is that worth to you and they're going to come back and they be like well if you were able to increase retention 8% that's worth $30 $ million a year it's like great okay give me one to $3 million a year and let's make it happen I think it's brilliant I think any product that charges some amount of recurring Revenue that's 20 30 bucks per person or user would massively increase adoption training someone and maybe that's something like an AI version of clippy from like the old Microsoft Office days can do but I just feel like I'm so there are so many tools that I use that I'm not using to their full potential and they would be really smart to do that Chris I love it been a pleasure uh all the hacks where could people find it all the hacks you just said it all the hacks.com all the hacks on search your podcast app search YouTube search my name I feel like you know you can find it I TR I have faith in this audience at finding anything yeah if you can find it you're not looking for the hacks you're probably you probably shouldn't be listening to that yeah all right thanks man thanks for having me I love these J later [Music]

but I had like there was one guy on Twitter who was like you know these people they're obviously smart why aren't they building something that can change the world and my response to them is sometimes you need to change your world before you change the world if you're able to take out a million 2 million 3 million whatever it is and retire your parents or you know give to a cause you care about or buy your first house or just get financial stability like that you know what people call you're nut you're first nut you know it's it's like the base of capital that you can sort of grow then I say kudos to these [Music] people all right perfect well let's just get into it then this is going to be something new uh I haven't done this before on the podcast but you asked me you said hey I got a bunch of things I want to talk to you about usually it's the other way around usually I'm like I'm just asking the questions but now you're going to ask the question so excited to see where this goes well the reason so I messaged for anyone listening I messaged Greg yesterday and I was like so many of the things that I just want to talk to you about I think your audience would find interesting to listen to because most of the episodes are like interview episodes uh the one I was on with you it's an interview and people get to learn a lot about the other people you're interviewing but actually I have a strong suspicion episodes that are focused more on just interesting things that are happening in the Greg verse might actually even do better um and there was a couple of things I wanted to talk to you about and like basically a couple of things in your Twitter that I was messaging you about and I was like let's just talk about this in a recorded fashion um and see what comes up so the first thing I mean you posted I think a couple of days ago something kind of crazy and it's this Riz app this is insane this AI dating Co what you posted was an AI dating coach built on top of chat GTP making $190,000 per month 333,000 downloads per month um and the founder got the idea from uh Tinder subreddit so I purposely didn't dig into this because I was going to ask you about it and just ask you what you think of it so what do you think about that do you think that's like an entire new business world or do you think it's just hype like do you think this is a oneoff thing or do you think something like that this is sustainable and actually can you also tell me what this [ __ ] thing is yeah and I have a funny story about that so but before I get into the funny story so I saw that post on Reddit I'm always on Reddit and I'm always just scouring for what's happening and I and I actually recommend like subscribing to 10 15 subreddits and like start start up stuff so that was the SAS subreddit um and I just find interesting stuff there so I saw that on on on the SAS subreddit and I think um you're just going to see more of that sort of stuff so what did what did someone do someone basically took a chat GPT rapper and focused it on on on companionship and dating and the more interesting thing is the founder reached out to me and he was like by the way dude that this isn't the only app that we have um so that guy here's what he said give me a second I'm G to pull it up but can I ask you just while you're looking for that what do you mean it so I am kind of maybe don't fully understand all this chat chat chat GPT stuff how do you just like train it on more companionship thing do you know how this works like what's the thing that he did that's special to all the other rappers do you understand that I have no idea I don't get it the beauty is you don't need it doesn't need to be special from like a product perspective it's just a it's completely marketing and what what matters in chat GPT rappers is really just like the brand is this something that people are going to tell their friends about so like for example the number one one of the top chat gbt app uh rapper uh apps right now is um it's called Riz r i ZZ and that's what the kids are calling you know RZ RZ right so you got that RZ Greg I appreciate that got but I think like the name matters more than anything and then the and sort of The Branding uh the referral flows within the app as well like how do you invite your friends to it so anyways I posted that on Twitter uh from that SAS um subreddit and then the founder reaches out to me and he says by the way incredible email just like so short and sweet he goes hi Greg I'm sure you're busy so I'm keeping this email brief number one I love you already by the way if you're numbering things love you already I love that too yeah number one I'm 23 and recently co-founded a small development Studio threers team hiring more now so cool amazing this is a 23-year-old who built this incredible uh doing $190,000 a month hate him and I love him I hate him and love him already um number two we've launched three apps so far and are closing in on $500,000 of Revenue per month I wonder how much of that is profit I wonder what the margin is my guess is it's I mean Apple takes a third right um so my guess is you know 65% plus and then he lists the names of the three apps that he's he's working on and links it thanks for linking it plug AI Astra pallet we'll come back to that then he says number three I'd love to connect over a call to learn from you my schedule my schedule is very flexible feel free to text call Anytime by the way and then he puts his phone number this this is something this texting and calling thing that's coincidental my phone just pinged that's something that came up yesterday in a session with a mutual acquaintance of ours called Blake I'm G to put that in a line here for networking and making deals for something I want to ask you later but I've I've just written that down it's a big coincidence that he that it's a big coincidence that you focused on this texting and calling thing from his email because there's something very special about that very special and he's being like empathetic and it's just a smart email a really really smart Emil it's not cocky it's not egotistical he's like he could say he could have said I'm super busy so let's see if we can find a slot but he said I'm super flexible just text me anytime there's there's something very clever about that so like the takeaway is really if you want to connect to someone to anyone and everyone's busy right you know everyone's busy just just be like here's my phone number text me and then we'll figure it out you know we'll figure it out from there it's as simple as that it's literally I just got to show you this actually I can show you my number but maybe I can blur this out uh this is literally what I just sent to one of our sales guys because they pulled in a pretty big lead um just give them my number and we'll chat it's like a like a large corporate and they're not used to you know someone from a company just saying here's my phone number let's talk straight away let's text um but I've realized some of the biggest corporate deals I actually for you and I talked about this earlier this week and I forgot to mention this and I've been testing it this week some of the biggest old school American corporate deals that I've closed have been like mostly text messaging yeah I think also like moving it to text it just like feels like you've taken it to the next level like it's like you've invited someone into your home so uh it's also just like now you have each other's phone numbers you can text each other oh hey I saw this article I think you might like it it's it's a it's a hack but going back to definitely yeah it's a hack but going back to uh this guy Alex what's really smart is he's he's got three apps and his company's called air RZ so he's got plug AI which is a texting assistant which is the one I posted about so it's you upload comos uh basically like you can screenshot your text messages and they'll give you pickup lines based on that great uh and they call it like the ultimate AI RZ um and so he's got that then he's got Astra which is life advice so really smart like if you uh you know I'm I'm looking through the App Store description this is how they describe it work through life's challenges talk about compatibility with friends and romantic interests discuss personal growth learn about your dreams all this and more at your fingertips with Astra and then the third one is called pallet and it says with pallet getting your color season is simple as taking one selfie pallette uses state-of-the-art AI to determine your color season and generate a custom color P palette personalized style and makeup suggestions and more so what has exactly so what has this person done that's brilliant they've they're basically doing coaching but in three different verticals yeah um AI coaching yeah AI coaching so it's it's brilliant because they're not building a lot of Technology they're leveraging um what what's out there they're coming up with interesting Brands around it and great positioning really really simple and then they're focusing on you know they're not being the app for everyone right they're going we're only doing dating coaching we're only doing style uh and makeup so so what's interesting about this for me there's two things that come to mind you probably know Peter levels yes from Twitter he has this uh similar product called therapist ai.com um although he says transparently that it's only making $33,000 per month right now um I tested this out it's pretty interesting because it actually it's almost like doing a video call with a therapist except it's a like well AI generated image of a person uh Works through telegram but what all this makes me think when I'm think about someone making 190k per month with something like this using chat GTP what comes to my mind I don't want to do this business but if someone can make 190k per month the thing that the people are looking for a couple of people are just probably curious and just want to try it out for fun but there's a an amount of people in there that actually want this dating advice and actually want help with replying to people and I think you could take a relatively large chunk of that if you took the same marketing power and took the same energy and kind of positioning and and did it as a real like a team basically if you were if it was human because that would be the actual that would be the way to kind of compete with a product like this and say okay this is $2 more but there's actually like rised up humans on the other side I I don't know how people use the terminology but you could actually take like a you could make it a relatively good amount of money I think taking the concepts that people have people are saying okay now we're making things AI on large scale but taking like the marketing used for that and taking it back to human but still relatively large scale at a higher price I don't know that that that would be the boring way I would take that apart and and make another side business out of it quick ad break let me tell you about a business I invested in it's called boring marketing.com so a few years ago I met this group of people that were some of the best SEO experts in the world they were behind getting some of the biggest companies found on Google and the secret sauce is they've got a set of technology and AI that could help you outrank your competition so for my own businesses I wanted that I didn't want to have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I didn't want to depend on ads to drive customers to my businesses I wanted to rank high in Google that's why I like SEO and that's why I use boring marketing.com and that's why I invested in it there's so confident in their approach that they offer a 30-day Sprint with 100% money back guarantee who does that nowadays so check it out highly recommend boring marketing.com I was just talking about this concept actually yesterday and you bring up a really good point so whenever there's a trend there's an there's always an anti-trend and some of the most interesting startup ideas actually come from the anti-trend so I'll give you an example trend biohack haing longevity people are trying to optimize their health and they're trying to live forever enter Brian Johnson say what you will and how strange he is in terms of like I love Brian Johnson I know you would love Brian Johnson by the way I think he's I think he's great my girlfriend and I just watched his latest YouTube video and we both love him yeah I'm not surprised that you love him but he is polarizing like some people you know no everyone loves them I've never seen I've never seen anyone saying anything bad about Brian Johnson ever the naked pictures with him and his 18-year-old son is completely normal okay I didn't see that but we get yeah we could I don't have an 18-year-old son so I don't know what you know right totally I still love Brian I'll stand by you ran exactly this is how good he is like he can take photos naked with his 18-year-old son and at least it's his 18-year-old son he's holding up like him and his son are holding like vials of blood oh I saw that yeah I saw that you know he's he's playing into this Narrative of him being like a psycho and a weirdo of course of course so so great so Brian Johnson is riding that Trend and creates a huge business on on top of it I think on his first day he actually like he he built his audience for two years didn't monetize it at all and then the next you know recently he he started a supplements and olive oil company and they sold $1.5 million of product in one day on a subscription mainly to me I would say 75% to Jonathan Courtney yeah I have so much of the olive oil it's actually disgusting and I also got it as a gift for like everyone I know of course you did so okay you know Brian Johnson's going on TV with like don't die dsh don't die D t-shirts what's the opposite of that it's well the opposite is die you know the opposite of is I'm going to live to 50 but every single day is going to be like hedonistic and amazing you know what I'm talking about yes absolutely that's going to yeah who's the influencer of D exactly so what you were talking about which is with AI and all these AI coaching and texting things you're right there's going to be an equal Demand on The Human Side and you might be able to charge a premium for it and it actually might be better business than some of these AI businesses dude think about it like this this Riz app guy who's making 190k per month with the chat GTP w could easily offer a premium upgrade where it's a human doing it and so it's just a a stranger entry point into some coaching thing rather than like it's almost like you get a preview of what it would be like for someone to help you you know using Tinder I I don't know exactly what the the product is doing I assume it's like helping you respond to the the messages like you said but imagine if you could add some human intervention to it then you could upgrade to a to a different uh price um it does seem I mean maybe that's just not what this guy wants to do but that could be an interesting way of having like a premium upgrade but also like you said the anti-trend company could come along and say well you know that pallet app uh this is the human version of pallet where you actually have an influencer running it and it's really me and I'll really give you a voice message and whatever um I agree anti-trends are always worth looking out for yeah and usually with anti-trends you actually have a lot less competition so for example with this AI assistant stuff it's just there's so many so much so many new products coming out every single day so here let me Circle back to why it was a funny story with this RZ app thing so turns out that there's another app so okay so the company the guy who emailed me runs a company called AI RZ that's his company that's like his little web web his Dev shop not to be confused with RZ AI which is the number one AI dating assistant app so it's when I go to their app you know their App Store previews it's literally the same app pretty much the same app it's very similar upload a screenshot AI generated lines it's the number right now as we're recording this it's the number 27 app in lifestyle so there's another app that's making a couple hundred grand mrr so then I get an a text message from someone I I I didn't have it in my address book he goes hey Greg how's it going we spoke back when sea Parker wanted me to recruit you for airtime l a few people shared your post with me seems like there's a confusion the app making 190k mrr is plug AI my app is Riz we never listed it for sale huh yeah so there's and I was just like I'm sorry you know I I just wrote that's confusing uh someone reach out oh I see if you read the actual post it says it the RZ is only mentioned when it says you can see some Tik Tock examples from a competitor called RZ that's right I also didn't read well clearly I also misread it totally so I like how long you us go on though yeah like 30 minutes of it being wrong we were wrong yeah and it just goes to show you that there's a ton of competition it doesn't mean that there's not a lot of opportunities um there are but I think if you want to build a Riz like GPT rapper what I would do is I'd go to nonobvious use cases like dating is very obvious therapist is very obvious so the only right now like forget like the everyone's going after the obvious ones so like make a list of like the non- obvious ones and to your point exactly and then and then and then to your point think about like the anti-r apps you know just go completely human what is yeah so we need a ATI Brian Johnson is me going on TV show saying all I do all day is drink beer and have really bad heartburn but I love it yeah I can't get enough of it I've been constipated for three years and I don't plan on fixing it yeah instead of like you know how Brian uh Brian Johnson shares as like biomarkers you're just sharing like how long you've been constipated for you're starting to hurt yeah I love it yeah I'm gonna do that I'm gonna go on these shows and I'm gonna be like yeah I just took blood from a random person on the street and injected it into myself because we good yeah we just want to see we want to see how uh I want to get I'm a 36y old but I'm trying to get all my body biomarkers up to a 96y old come on Brian you start living in like senior homes yeah exposing myself to like really strong radiation totally eating white bread all day nothing else that's right yeah I do actually I kind of have a bit of heartburn today to be honest I love it help me Brian so okay uh I don't know how long you want to make this episode I brought a I brought a lot of stuff dude the episode will end when the episode ends well I want to finish up on this this rizap thing so what is this plug thing that's making 190k a month so now I'm lost so okay plug AI which is basically RZ it's competitor to RZ plug AI it's a competitor okay so it does something similar okay it does something similar it's basically the same idea I don't know I'm not going to I don't know if he copied it like I don't know who came first don't know enough about the situation doesn't matter doesn't matter but it basically is the same app and in addition I think what was smart about the why is it called plug like you're the plug I mean a plug means like I mean now we sound like some some older guys just like explaining I I'm European I have an excuse I don't know about these things like someone who you know who has who has access and you is the plug like you're the plug oh somebody who who like could get you into a club or something yeah exactly something like that oh I thought it was I had something different in mind and I'm not going to say it on this I won't say it here but I I was I literally thought about a plug like I'm looking here at like a plug board where you plug stuff into and I'm like the app has a pretty risky name actually risky okay risky risky name okay so plug is like someone who can who can give you access okay um okay so the app that's making 190k per month is plug correct and do you think they'll be able to keep this up or do you think this is like one of these flash in the pens for two months they're going to make money out of it and then it's done so like would you invest in this would you invest in the in the guy who's making all these apps do you think this is a sustainable way of running a business like having these kind of quick hypey things so what's smart about what this guy is doing is he's not putting all his eggs in the Riz basket right he has three apps now uh in different spaces so even if one you know gets screwed he he's got a couple others that being said he's still he's still be built on top of GPT so like you know open AI could decide to like charge 50x with their no more plug yeah no more plug and that would that would suck and that's a real risk of the business that being said when I when I tweeted about this app I got so many people being like this is so dumb it's going to get it's going to be it's a flash in the pan like it's GNA only last one month they're they're building on top of you know open AI they're going to shut them down and my take on that is okay but like so what so what this guy's making $500,000 a month in Revenue yeah you're learn he's also learning how to run a business the skills that he's learning while doing this are going to be trans erable to whatever he makes next I mean just from a financial perspective if he's making $350,000 of profit per month and he makes you know close to four Mill he'll make if this lasts for 12 months which I think isn't crazy you know he's going to make $4 million would I invest in something like this like absolutely just knowing that there's there's risks and yeah the the way I would invest wouldn't be like I want Equity it would be like hey want like a profit shair of this thing yeah give me a profit shair yeah it's it's not it's not a guy who who's trying to like have some massive IPO or a crazy exit it's just let's make some profit yeah but I had like there was one guy on Twitter who was like all over me about how this is a bad way to start a business and my my belief is like not necessarily if you know the risks associated with it and if you're able to take out a million two million three million whatever it is and retire your parents or you know give to a cause you care about or buy your first house or just get financial stability like that you know what people call you're nut your first nut I knew you'd like that one you know it's it's like the base of capital that you can sort of grow then I say kudos to these people that's this is the clip for the start of the episode if you want to do the little preview because I would want to know what we're talking about if I was listening to this no but I agree I think that's a very practical it's I think sometimes practicality is missing from uh Twitter business people this is actually what I like about your uh your tweets which is why I actually message you after you post something and I'm like wait what about this and this and this it's there is a lack of of financial practicality to a lot of business advice like that's that's one of the things that I noticed when I was um when I'm working with mentors some times and they're like it's about changing the world it's about having the vision and I'm like I'm still trying to make money like I'm still you know I'm not financially independent I'm I'm still trying to as you said I'm not is it a is it the is it a thing to say to get my nut it's a thing okay I'm I'm I I don't know if I want to have uh if I'm going to trust you with that big smile on face just say it just say it so we can clip it but honestly I think this is yeah that's a really good point that gives them like a foundation to try other things um and yeah I I would I think people arguing when you post anything people want to find the reason why something's not going to work because that also makes them sound smart you know so totally doesn't really matter what you must get a lot of that because you have a lot of uh people following you and you're very opinionated someone someone was like why you know these people why why they're so they're obviously smart but why are they building why aren't they building something that can change the world and my response to them is sometimes you need to change your world before you change the world Mike draw boom you know what I'm saying boom boom that's the Sip like we got to take a sip on that one on that one that's that's a quick sip it's still kind of a SI count the Sip if it kind of sticks a little bit you're the you're the antiban Johnson I want to be I want to get a t-shirt that just says Brian Johnson with extreme constipation and heartburn totally or or just get a t-shirt that says 36y old and a 90-year-old body I'm trying to get my tri triglycerides up to 400 I don't know like imagine 50 is normal or something I'm trying to like I'm trying to win the game by putting all of the numbers up no matter what they are God bless gout I want my Gout levels at 7,000 I I I'm not going to go I think I think that this this being short and sweet is going to be good so I'm just going to actually skip the other thing that I wanted to talk about and ask you are you going to get the new eight sleep I sent it to my so I have the eight sleep you know I'm as sleep nerd we talked about it dude I have two eight sleeps I I'm I'm like struggling right now with what to do I'm like and I only got them less than a year ago so new a sleep came out for those who don't know pod pod four Ultra yeah and the only thing so okay the coolest thing about it in my opinion is the fact that you could move your bed up and down like there's like a motor in it hospital bed yeah it's it's it's so wild and that is really cool because I don't know if you're like reading in bed and you know I think that's a huge thing like what I do now is I put like literally six pillows on top of each other and like yeah I'm like trying to and my my wife is like what are you doing like there's like a million pillows you're the first guy who's ever had a situation where the wife is asking why there's too many pillows yeah like literally I've never be every single situation I've ever had has involved me thinking there's too many pillows in the bed oh yeah oh it's uh she definitely looks at me strangely with the amount of pillows I require but I just I can't be I can't be flat like if I'm going to read yeah can't be flat flat I can't be flat you can't be flat you got to pay $4,500 to not be flat I didn't get this far in my life to lay flat exactly what is the point of doing all of this [ __ ] [ __ ] if I have to lay flat what like a seal totally yeah that's really cool but you I would buy it if my my side can go up and her side could stay this is this is what they're not making clear on the website my girlfriend and I were talking about this too if I'm snoring so the idea with the Pod for Ultra the update the biggest updates are basically number one the bed can move so that you can when you're snoring it can kind of Raise Your Head uh so that it stops you snoring and you can put it in reading mode where the bed is a little bit more like a hospital bed but I'm wondering like if I'm snoring and my girlfriend's not snoring is that just going to like flip is it going to move both of our heads up or is it just going to move my head up and kind of roll me out of the bed and like you know what I mean what what it it's not clear to me looking at the website what's going to happen the the thing that I like the most the two features that I like the most are one it's supposed they say it's quieter 40% quieter which I think is actually a really big deal I was telling you in the last episode that one of my Bigg issues with the Pod three is that it's quite loud um and the second thing is that they say you can feel the the the pipes I guess they don't like to call them pipes you can't feel the the little bumps in the bed that the cool water flows through um whatever they call those they call it like the array or something I call them the pipes apparently these are not you can feel them anymore and I think that would also be a big deal um and it cools even more although I never managed to for me it's it's like cold enough already um and you don't need your phone in the room anymore because you can just tap the bed to make it cooler or warmer which is kind of cool that's really cool yeah I think that that to me is also like that's the second favorite feature of it um because I don't want to touch my phone at all right I don't want to touch your phone either man filthy yeah it's filthy so I think that's huge and uh I just pulled up my sleep Fitness report from last night 909 you know oh that's kind of embarrassing isn't it because hello baby what do we got here 99 99 dude you were asleep you didn't even wake up once you were like a log what's waking up it's because I'm using the Deep Brown noise I don't even know what waking up is I don't even know what waking up is at night anymore okay well you know to put a bow on on the eight sleep thing my my request for them is for for for one side to be able to come up and down otherwise I'm not I don't know if I'm gonna buy it 100's insane hundred's sleep Fitness or good good work I am I need to be anti Brian Johnson but I'm accidentally becoming Brian Johnson yeah my perfect scores um you're you're I don't think so what I'm going to do I think is we're going to talk about them enough that they send us a free one each yeah totally like eight sleep if you send us a free pod 4 ultra uh we'll test it out and give an honest review um as people who are struggling to get 100s every day totally I mean and that's like another example of a startup idea is like you create a you create a a paid membership around sleep and you call it the hundred Club I like that it's all about getting to a 100 and it's and then you do membership where like you get just like probably some physical products that help you sleep like an eye mask or a month or different things and as a community of people who like share their scores and you you just likey the whole experience you run out of ideas on the third month already so you send people an eye mask you send people sleep supplements you send people like a brown noise thing and you're like I don't know what to do anymore and you just stop sending it and hope people don't stop paying it's just like I I can't think of any more ideas guys we're done t-shirt well The 100 Club is actually kind of a fun idea for tech people like the using the the graphic that they use in the eight sleep app yeah with the number with the 100 totally um and then and then there needs to be the anti- movement the zero club correct which is about people who don't sleep at all yes exactly I love that I love that dude that's it I have tons more ideas but I just I think it's good to like give this sort of an episode of test run before overloading it too much I think this is just as long as a normal episode the Sip the Sip okay well if people like this episode please please let us know in the YouTube comments uh also you know subscribe follow on Apple podcast and Spotify um because that's the only way well it's not the only way but it's it's a great way to learn when new episodes are dropping um And subscribe to the YouTube um and of course go to Greg Eisenberg dcom um and subscribe to the newsletter because there I'll also tell you when new episodes are dropping and Jonathan what do you have to say to end this um the idea here is that I bring stuff for Greg to react to I'm kind of like his like producer in the background being like Greg what do you think of this what and I get I get the advantage of hearing the answers uh and being able to Scuttle off and take action on them so I'm very excited about it I'd love to do it more often uh but obviously the audience has to find it interesting so it's different from an interview show because it's basically just Greg given his Vibes on stuff I think people would listen to that Weekly um that's my that's my feeling and yeah you should subscribe to this podcast you're listening to right now on Apple podcast and Spotify and YouTube all right sip you and Riz app sip you later Jonathan SI you later we got to end with a sip

sheet we can go anywhere but you shared a sheet usually I I asked for people to bring three startup ideas no of course you're not going to give me three startup ideas you gave me like 25 which were all all amazing someone's going to listen to this episode and do like a bunch of your ideas doesn't make many millions of dollars so I hope so man I wish I had more time I want to do every one of these and everyone or most of them on that list we've done like betas of or just like Alpha versions and like tested to see if it would work and validated them and so it's just like you know they're sitting in the chamber it's like the next thing I want to do but anyway that's the that's the dream with all of it so where do you want to start I I want to start um I'm obsessed with Cricket I I called it cry cup for forever um I think this will be a good like point to kind of because there's three of them that are all related to this um you know this has been talked about in public some but I don't think people understand how big this Market is and how like ravenous they are for for this type of of stuff so um maybe we go from there and we can kind of rattle through those three first let's rock cool all right so the fir first idea is uh I want to start with the selling a like subscription service to unlimited designs for Cricket so Cricket for people that don't know is like a tabletop CNC machine that Crafters use um it's like it huge market share it's one of these companies that's like in the billions that nobody knows about so basically how they make money is it's kind of like a printer company right where it's like they sell this like high ticket item um and it's and then they basically sell materials to these same people over and over again so the test that I ran was I was like you know what I wonder if I can get AI to basically make all of these graphic designs like that are bgs and these are the files that they use on these machines and so did that and then I was like cool so like let's just go find how many like different keyword phrases that are related to like C Cricut files or SVG files so if you go on like Etsy there's like millions of these shops that sell these types of things right and so anyway we're this kind of evolved into I was like okay we could basically at scale with AI make these SVG files based off of Target keywords that people are already searching we know there's an audience that already like buys these or wants these so now how do we get this in front of them so if you go on Facebook you can Target people that have an interest in Cricut the website so we ran ads to them just to a Shopify store and I created a bundle of SGS it was like I think 20 different svgs that were all like horse related right like floral horse SVG and uh like floral horse head SVG like all these different you know variations of it we were getting less than $1 downloads of this thing so like a imagine you want to make a list of 10,000 customers like you just go and basically spend like five grand and suddenly you have an email list to zero to one this then what you sell to them um and there's already companies that are doing this that are huge one of them is called creative Fabrica they're doing I think around like 30 million a year they're funded it's ridiculous it's some European company that again nobody has ever heard of but what they do is they sell an unlimited subscription to the svgs that are on the site so then it's a recurring Revenue so what you get them in the door with is this free package and then just put them in a drip email nurture that's basically like want unlimited svgs you can create this so why this opportunity exists now and why it's easier than it was previously is because you can make all of this different uh like files types like at scale with AI and you couldn't do that previously so like five years ago if you wanted to do this you know you'd have an offshore team of like thousands of graphic designers that would be just yeting these out into existence and then putting them on your site now you can do that same thing with like these tools like s you know background removing tools and then just like upscaling like tools and then you basically like take that upscaled black and white file turn it into an SVG like that whole thing that I just described there's apis that exist for every single one of those so like again when we made that little bundle that was like these 20 different things that that what we did is like they generated in Discord we D like we had a bot download them we then had uh uh a GitHub repo upscale them we then hit an API to remove background we then uh hit an API to turn it into an SVG and that package was all created with no human intervention all we did was just provide the target keywords that we already knew that people were searching for so basically you could zero to one this Marketplace overnight get your initial customers and then the long-term play with this is you then go and you build like hundreds of thousands of these landing pages on your Marketplace and get those to rank organically for SEO which creates more inbound you give them like you know when they sign up they get one free bundle down or something and then you upsell them again into that subscription and when you think about the size of this market like this is easily a $10 million a year company like you could do this tomorrow like I want to do this so bad but again it's just like one of these things that I we just don't have time for so anyways happy to dive deeper on any of that but yeah so I don't know if I I live under a rock but I had never heard of cricket it was on uh MFM at one point I think it was like two years ago and I was just laughing to myself when they mentioned it because like so I've been selling um in the print on demand space since like 2010 right so really early in that made a bunch of money in it lost even more money in it uh because I had no idea what I was doing early on and like how to build brand and actually like do it well um but yeah so that that's like kind of why I know this exists and I this probably was like in two you know during like the the late days of of the pandemic that they' like brought this up on one of the shows and again we we know that like this space exists because there's so many people like when you look at Etsy majority of their sellers are these people that own these machines right and so what they're selling on Etsy and like driving all that revenue for Etsy is literally just like custom you know Tumblr mugs but they're building this with like basically like these SVG files and then uh whatever materials that they're buying and actually using on the printer to like you know make these die Cuts or you know whatever it is that they do that they add to these customized products so and if you were going to build an MVP of this how much money do you think it would require I think you could get this off the ground for like 10 grand like 100% like 10 grand and the five grand in ad spend like you just use like Shopify already has like a subscription feature and I I would just use like offthe shelf tools longterm it would like you would hit limitations with the amount of Collections and like landing pages you could build on shop I say that but like there's also this like thing you can do with Pro Shopify just we could go into this is another company that's on the list so we can come back to this but Shopify just released this ability to like you basically make these subfolders and then we figured out how to use cloud flare to like bulk create collection pages so traditionally Shopify has a API rate limit that's like not great if you have like a ton of SKS so say you have 100,000 SKS and you want to make 10 million landing pages for longtail keywords related to the SKS on your platform you just like couldn't do this right and so we basically figured out how to do this with like the technology like this Cloud fair and what Shopify offers now technology but the kicker was that we could have ai write SEO content based off of those keyword phrases so again when you're saying like SVG horse bundle it could write all of the all the the content and that would go on that page so again when you look at like these huge marketplaces like like house.com as an example like how do they actually make money it's because they have millions of landing pages that all rank for all of these keyword phrases and they're basically just brokering traffic like that's actually what the business is when you look at a Marketplace like how marketplaces actually make money is they broker traffic for transactions and then they make even more money off the ads that they're selling on the platform like if you look at the like p&l of an Amazon as an example like where they actually make revenue is not the marketplace fees it's on people bidding on these specific items and the reason for that is like there's only so there's a floor on how low you can go on product cost right and like the margin you could squeeze out of that but there's no ceiling on ad spend that people can go right so it's like it can go up infinitely and you see this already in Google but we're just like like for example if you look at the lawyer space some cpcs depending like if you look at like DUI lawyer uh Denver right like the CPC on it it's like $110 right crazy absolutely crazy but when you look at that like the value like if they get if they close one of those that's like a 15K deal for that lawyer so of course it's like that right it basically can go up infinitely as high as the market can sustain it but you can all you can't decrease the cost like the cost has has a floor so anyways to get back to this this idea of like how cheaply you could do it I think that you could probably get this off the ground for like 10 grand um and then it's just like you'd have to have like a little bit of technical knowledge to kind of like piece together all this but again our MVP was like human put in like you know something into a Discord Channel downloaded and then just hit these public like API end points like it's not I mean a python script could do that whole thing right so so your Marketplace point I just want to talk about that for a second because I think it's really really smart so the best marketplaces to me are really Niche with high intent so yes Amazon has a lot of intent but it's not which is amazing like you're in the buying mood you want to you want to make a purchase and a lot of people buy on Amazon but at the end of the day like it's pretty horizontal whereas this you know your idea here it's like a pretty specific type of person and just like scanning YouTube right now it seems like a lot of women uh moms 100% yeah so moms seem to be really into it I was chatting with a buddy today who's building a Marketplace for uh Elder Care like how you know your parents are getting older um they need someone to come in house great idea yeah assisted living like in your house so he's building a marketplace around that super smart because not only are they going to make money on the transaction of just like bringing you to connect you with this elder care person but now of a sudden you can sell them like 500 other things because you know where they are in their life cycle yes exactly also they're like typically historically like a high net worth individual because they've accumulated that wealth over their like whole lifespan right um I I want to I want to kind of pull out a piece of this as well on the marketplace side like I think that right now like every Marketplace could be disrupted like with AI tools right so like you have these huge players like Amazon I think you could cve out carve these subsets like for every all these different niches that exist Within These large marketplaces and like historically like you'd have an engineering team of a thousand people they would be working on this massive Marketplace and it's like yo we just again like in our test that we did so my friend has this shop she has like 10,000 SKS and so we're like all right this that shop of iigh think I was talking about let's just like throw up 100,000 landing pages and see what happens we'll do some like Auto indexing on the back just like submitting to Google over and over again so like overnight increased her organic traffic by 10% and increased her organic Impressions by like about 20% so I mean again super small test it was only like over a six-month period validated the idea but I'm just thinking about that for like any sub like like custom kozies or like you know any of these kind of weird Niche spaces you could basically build out these sites now for so like so cheap of cost like this I I think that you there there's this huge opportunity for uh Founders to just go and do these things if they want to create like a really powerful cash flowing business and like this is actually where I see the opportunity in programmatic SEO like everybody's like you know I'm gonna write 100,000 blog posts with AI from like it's general knowledge like all right that's kind of cool but like what if I do like 10 million product landing pages on a website right and like all it's selling is print on demand products you're at that scale like you're talking about as many like Pages as a as a as an Etsy and then building like okay how do I build links this to actually get this to rank it's like just reach out to like Mommy bloggers and be like do you want a free product off this like pick one of these I'll send it to you at like do a post on your site and like that just costs you eight to build a link that has a DA of 50 like that's the that's the like economics of the business here from like a marketing standpoint so I was gonna say mik drop but I wouldn't want you to drop your mic you are hold but yeah so so that's that's the idea one with the uh with cricet the next idea um is selling the materials to those people so again how cricet is a billion dollar company is they're actually they're really I would look at them as like just a what printer Inc is to HP that's what like you know all of this materials are to to these Cricut sellers so when I'm talking about materials like think of like tinsil foil and like you know it's almost just like these pieces of paper that they lay out on this thing and it cuts it out of it right um but there's all these different materials that you could use so you could use the same idea but instead of having it be a subscription Marketplace you do that same top of funnel so it's like offer some SVG bundle to them that's basically like that you can get those downloads again all I did was I ran Facebook ads with a conversion event for on like to shop to a Shopify store right I'm using the base theme like the base theme that Shopify provides for this test and we were getting like less than dollar emails right like the hustle was built off of this exact strategy like they sold the HubSpot for 40 million and like morning Brew was built off of this exact strategy all I'm talking about is using it in this different space in this Ecom space but you could do so you get those emails and then you go and you sell them these materials all this could be sourced from like you know China you just go and [ __ ] look on like Alibaba Etc find all of these find the most high intent or the most repeat purchasers you could go use like a jungle Scout or like any of these tools that help you do like product Analytics on these marketplaces find the most popular materials and then just like have a way cheaper cost and it's just a margins game at that point the challenge with that is like it's inventory management it's a physical thing but like again if there if it's a repeat purchase that this person is making your cost to acquire them is less than a dollar and you know the lifetime of that customer is probably going to be in the you know the thousands number because if you look at some of the prices on these it's like $50 for a roll of this you know it's it's basically like wrapping paper like you're selling them wrapping paper and like that is what you're shipping to them right so like when you think about the value of that customer over time okay so to take a step back why why did Native deodorant like why how did DDC DDC companies like actually make money um it's not when it's a transactional purchase it's when we know that there's going to be repeat purchases that occur it's a consumable product right so by selling this like tinsel or whatever it is that you're selling to these Cricut enthusiasts like you're selling a consumable product so you know they going to come back for that and then it's just like run deals on a weekly basis because a lot of these people that I just like know personally like my girlfriend's friends they're like really into crafting and they have these things they are like you know they'll get a an email where it's like 50% off flash deal on you know this like cow you know design whatever tinsel and for them like they'll just buy it because it's kind of an impul pulse purchase at like 25 bucks right and they get a bundle or whatever it ends up being they may never even touch it they've got a closet full of it that they don't use but they almost sit on top of it like just how like how most like crafting people like do they have like it's like quilting it's the same idea I have all these different patterns I might like I'll come back to them and use them in the future but I'm always kind of like Scouting For the next you know material that I can I can basically get to add to my library that I can go back to for that crafting project so yeah and it feels like you're hitting on on like a macro Trend which is just like people don't want digital stuff anymore like they want to do things like quilting they want to do things like crafting they want to do like they want to touch feel and it's like Back to Basics kind of so there's just it feels like there's just like a bunch of old things like that people used to do in the 20s 30s 40s 50s that now you can be like oh wait let's go build something in that space 100% I mean I we we started we call it low power hour we started doing this like we try to do it daily it doesn't happen but basically it's like no screens is the idea um so it's like we listen to vinyl and like may like got a typewriter maybe I'll write on that and like we just kind of hang out like my girlfriend and I and our dog and just like you know kick it right and I think that that is like you know again part of this macro Trend that's happening like people are trying to do more of this and be have this like dedicated time for like slowness right um so yeah I I think that there's probably like a ton of businesses in that space you could build as well like selling those types of products um one I saw recently that was super cool was uh it's basically like an LED kind of like a larger screen of whatever the album cover was so it syns up to your Spotify and it like has that like there in your room so like you know when you go to a vinyl listening bar and they like put up that uh like the vinyl that's playing currently it's that same idea but it kind of like creates this like aesthetic within your space um I feel like that's like an kind of a product that's in this category or you know it's sort of like related that you could you could spin up and like capitalize on this like larger Trend I like it take a sip literally and tell me what's next um I want to talk I want to talk Chrome extensions cuz like I am obsessed with them um so to start have you heard of email extractor go Google email extractor right now this keyword gets like 250,000 searches a month and the top of that page you're going to see this Chrome extension that's literally named email extractor yep and it has 300,000 users and it's just has a free tier and then has a paid tier I think the paid tier is like10 or $15 right so let's just do some you know envelope math with this like you got 300,000 users say 5% turn into customers that's kind of like an average that we'll see what we could even go down to 1% we'll say 5% we'll do 1% just to kind of hit it so 1% of those you got 30 what is that uh that's 3,000 users paying you $10 a month like that's 30k I think it's doing way more than that like just based off of I own some of these tools like I think he's probably doing around 250 to 300,000 a month with this this thing and like this is one of like many of tools that you could build and all they do is just like extract data from a larger like Place basically so like another great example for this is like a Shopify spy tool right so like what this does is it's for drop shippers to basically see what other like Shopify stores their best sellers are so how this works is Shopify has this like bestseller category that's pre-built into the store most shops don't turn this off because it's you the problem with it is like you want people to be able to use that like automated category like that that's like a a very traffic to place but what this allows for companies to do is basically like or competitors to do is you can do competitor analysis on these other companies again this this the one that I'm referencing I think it's Shopify DS spy.com probably I would guess does about 50,000 a month in revenue and it's you know a oneperson team they just rank for that keyword so the whole strategy here is like find something related to like data scraping or like some type of like extraction from a web page that they're going on because like most of the time when people think Chrome extensions they immediately go to like honey or like any of the you know or grammarly these massive tools I'm not talking about that I'm talking about like what is a job to be done that's like super small like you know getting data out of red fin as an example right because they don't have an API and so building a tool that's like that and then you go and you buy like the exact match domain name for that Target keyword you go you build like 30 links to it and you'll get it to rank page one we've like done this already and then that turns into your top of funnel they sign up you have a free tier then you have some type of usage where it's like bump pricing based off of usage and you put them into an email nurture to get them to convert and again like I have a tool that's in this space that like we I've owned for eight years and like all it does is extract data like from another site and like that is it's paid my rent right so like now scale that up build 20 of these build 50 of these and like with these tools it's not like the product scope is huge so they don't break like the only time it breaks is like if the website changes and if the website changes it's not a massive thing like you've already got this code built so like if I was a developer and like an engineer and I was trying to figure out okay what's my first product and like how can I like build this portfolio company this is like this is where I would spend all of my time um and again it's like one of these things where like we're we're building like small like I you know I think I have three or four of these now um that are kind of in this space uh but like the goal is like get 50 of these a hundred of these and if they're all doing you know even 10 grand a month like that's a great little like holding company that you just created and it's not crazy technical like this is not a hard lift like he's extra he's looking for like he's basically rexing emails out of website and he's like that is what he's making money off of with with the the email extractor tool so the craziest thing about I I just the craziest thing about the email extractor tool to me is I Googled like on on the actual Chrome Store you can find the address of the guy of the person who built it so I Google the address and I what comes up is actually a ebike store like electronic bike store based in Madrid and I feel like it's just a bike shop that kind of just stumbled upon this created a small little app th% literally called it email extractor like the most basic of names which by the way worked in their advantage like just call it what it is 100% for small tools call it what it is be as like specific as possible and like what you'll find and again I just like these are these are my favorite businesses because like there's no customer service like there's no like product scope increase you have like very it's it's very seldom that they break they just run in the background and like cash comes in we get a check every month we don't have to think about it like it's the you know it's the dream this is what every you know everybody that's built card companies like this is the dream like like with you know with the current thing I'm building swell AI like it's a platform like there's so much that comes with that like we have to like it's just the scope of the business is so more so much more complex then yo this thing like it finds emails on the page that you're currently on and you can download it as a CSV that is its functionality and it's probably made this guy a millionaire this bike shop owner that's in Madrid exactly uh I love it and God bless your soul for doing a platform but it's fun it's actually fun doing what you're like what you're doing is super fun like on the fun scale yeah yeah as a Founder it's super fun and like it's also just like every day I wake up and it's a puzzle we're superly a year and a and so it's trying to figure out where does this fit in like the mind of people like where is the actual opportunity like we started out in podcasters podcasters have zero money they're the worst people to sell to there's all these companies that are raising money right now for like podcasting apps like all of these tools and I just am laughing in the background because there's just I I know how I know this industry there's no way that you're going to build a billion dollar company in this space like full stop just that's not going to happen so it's like in particular like Jason calanis has invested in like three companies that are like exact competitors of us and we're just laughing because it's like like how many tap bats can you get with this it's not going to work so where we see more of an opportunity now is like okay can we build the AI content marketing engine because then I can have B2B teams sit on top of us right and that's a way like you know I we're starting to get traction with like people that do webinars because they have these experts come in and they give these talks for like an hour and they're like cool like all right we had like five people attend it what do we do with this now and it's like all right we we can make this like content production workflow for you but again it's like these things you would never like intellectually an email extractor is and like just as a Founder that's like not a super fun or interesting business like I want to spend most of my mental energy on this more like you know complex thing and then build these other businesses that just are kind of like on autopilot running in the background ground that are way less mental energy like sometimes those are the best businesses right it's like there's days I dream about just like starting a window washing company think I could crush it I think I could like I I think I could build like a $10 million a year window washing company in like probably three years just like doing like only doing uh like local SEO like it's so easy right now to do local SEO it's the most ridiculous thing so you know uh uh uh all of the uh like locksmith companies are the same companies right if you yeah so if you call if you call like for example I'm in Denver if you call any of the listings that are locksmith Denver it's going to be routed to the same like company it's like the same call center and it's like they all have different names but all they're doing is just owning the entire front page of that local service right and so then what they do is like homie shows up at your house he's like oh yeah it's in your garage like this is you know $250 right I locked my dog in our car the other day this is like exactly what happened I'm over here and I'm sitting I'm like so I'm like who do you work for and you know this is like who I am I'm like what's how does this function like what does this like and he's like oh yeah I work for this guy like this company and I'm like okay well I called this company he's like oh yeah it's like it's all the same it's all the same company like this one guy owns it and it's like all almost all of them in the US is like the same family they like all know each other it's like kind of how the patels own motels so anyways I think you could like something that's like a dirt under the fingernails business that's physical the challenge with all this is like it's like it's employee management like my brother's in the medical space and like this this is their biggest like bane of their existence it's just how do I keep employees happy and like how do we get new employees in especially now when like the average time that an employee spends at one of these locations is like 18 to 24 months so it's it's you know that you're it's it's just super expensive to do that part of the business even though it's like this cash printing like like type of company so yeah quick ad break let me tell you about a business I invested in it's called boring marketing.com so a few years ago I met this group of people that were some of the best SEO experts in the world they were behind getting some of the biggest companies found on Google and the secret sauce is they've got a set of technology and AI that could help you outrank your competition so for my own businesses I wanted that I didn't want to have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I didn't want to depend on ads to drive customers to my businesses I wanted to rank and Google that's why I like SEO and that's why I use boring marketing.com and that's why I invested in it they're so confident in their approach that they offer a 30-day Sprint with 100% money back guarantee who does that nowadays so check it out highly recommend boring marketing.com yeah I think it's I think you know the takeaway for me there is just like choose your poison as an entrepreneur and like there's pros and cons to to all you know everything everything has pros and cons um and that's why I love the holding company model is like pick and choose the stuff that you're going to you know you like you know I think about it it's like turns entrepreneurship into into an all you can eat buffet and it's like do you want some pizza you want some pasta you want maybe you want like some oysters I don't know but like Pi pick um and the thing you know with uh with buffets is you don't want to put everything on you don't want to put oysters with with pizza and you know steak or it's just too much on one plate you got to go one at a time you know that's a strategy toing all you can eat buffet th% I mean that's like how I'm approaching this stuff right like it's different with the small things because it's like oh I can have an offshore team create a Chrome extension for three grand in like three weeks right but if it's like okay we're building this platform this is a big long-term bet and like for that it's like I'm you know that's where the focus is as soon as it gets to a sustainable place then it's like oh yeah I can go back to the salad bar and maybe I'm just going to do like you know like all croutons with like dressing right and we'll call it a salad but that like I that won't happen until you can like you have to create stability with these other companies and I think that's the thing that I see a lot of and it depends on your your goals right like my BET right now is like I'm trying to build like a bigger company that can service B2B Enterprise like clients over the long term right it's a 10year bet so that's happening there and then there's all of these other like small things that are occurring but there's probably a Tipping Point where it's like swell gets to a place where it's like okay cool like it's now it's like you know self- sustaining it's growing consistently we know that how to sell this to Enterprise we know like our goto market and at that point then it's like I can kind of back out of this and let the system and process run itself and focus on that next thing but it's it's always you know this is the challenge with I think every every person that likes to start companies is like you know just shiny A syndrome so like this to me is almost therapy so I get to put these out there and it's like please for the love of God make these companies and then just tell me that you did so I can like you know entrepreneur ride along and vicariously live for you like that's half of why I I love the like the show pivot Is So Good by the way I I I think it's the best decision that's ever happened like it is the most gangster business move I've seen so far in 2024 like I stand behind this because there's so many entrepreneurs and all they want it's like it's like like like it's junk food for for like people that want to start businesses you know it's like hearing business ideas that they could go start like why is that podcast what is it it's like side Hustle Basics or something like why is that one of the top entrepreneurship podcasts in the entire world it's because like all he does is just give you ideas like the 200 million people in the US that want to start a business but like don't they're the people that are listening to this it's like oh I could do that oh I could do that and suddenly he has this massive audience that he gets demonetized because of it so yeah dude in entrepreneurship you don't often make a decision and you're like that was the right decision and this I was like I I made the decision right before I went to sleep I woke up the next day like sweating and just like ready to get out of bed and I was like startup ideas podcast yes that was a good decision 100% 100% And I think again it hits such an awesome breath of people right like when like you could be a funded company like a founder and like this could be your drunk food podcast right it's like you're focusing on like you know building AI tool that does ux design or whatever but you can sit down and listen to some dude talk about creating a a subscription company for like you know Cricut files right like that and and to you it's like oh like you because half of this I think for people that like to build is like it's just the puzzles like I am uninterested with the operations of the business right like I want to figure out how like I want to figure out all the puzzles I want to write the documentation I want to get people operating on that process and then I never want to think about it or touch it again unless there's like an issue that comes up that I have to solve right and that's like when we were when I was at R of Health like that was like our hiring criteria like are these people's like are these people puzzle people like in the in the early stage like in the early days of the company it was like are they puzzle people that can document their thing and like are they friendly like if those if those three things were like yes it was a lot like we're like okay we'll hire them like they're going to like help us solve these issues because when you get to scale as a like that there's a way different type of person that that's that person and then that's like an operations person and I think that that is like it's something that a lot of entrepreneurs don't think about is like that you should you should focus on the thing that you're really good at and it's way way more of a commodity to be a good operations person than it is to be somebody that can like take an idea from non-existent and like Bend reality so that this thing now exists right so focus on that thing that you're good at and then get people behind you that are the Ops piece I mean and there's challenges with that right like how do you find people that are actually good at Ops I I not saying that this is like some like TurnKey easy thing it's more just they're they're way they're way more common right like just think about how many NBAs that are out there that went you know worked at deoe just like find one of them and tell them to just like don't blow this up like I don't really care like you don't have to be creative like and that's another thing for startup Founders too sorry I'm on a I'm on a tear right now so cut me off at any point but like I saw this happen so many times where they would like get to like 20 employees and they're like all right it's time to hire like a deoe MBA right I'm like yo you're about to just like screw everything up because first thing they do is they try to turn everything into a system and a process like as soon as they enter in yeah and they're they try to create like here's here's these systems like it like approval processes and checks and balances and [ __ ] and like yo I'm over here and like day by day like I you know I worked on the grow team when we were at rupo like day by day we would discover things and by the end of the day like we would have a new tactic and strategy that was out in public right and so like our measurement of success and like what we like internally like we built a newsletter internally to like basically tell people what was happening like the the experiments that were happening over in marketing and growth so that we could get Buy in from the organization right because like a lot of the times it's invisible it's like oh we just found this new way like oh if we do a event trigger deeper down in the funnel of like the signup flow and we send that data back to Google rather than this initial form submission we actually get better quality like lead quality and a higher conversion rate on the people that our salese actually talk to and convinced to use the platform but like you know that's nobody would ever know that it would exist unless you like talk about it and so this is like this other thing that I learned from when you're like working I worked in a marketing agency it was like this like overcommunication of like and also like this like you're marketing to your client right like when you sell ideas to people like you are marketing to them like where they are now and where they're going to be in the future like that's actually like what an agency is doing and you have to do that same thing when you're an employe and when you do that you get so much leverage right like we even like sat down and like my my friend Kobe who's still there we would just like 10 minutes and just like talk you know here's like everything that kind of happened this week and we do that and we just put it in public in like the internal slack Channel and then oh it creates this Clarity and visibility there's all this movement that's happening and then there's this like hype that builds around that as well like what's going on in growth what's going on in growth like that type of thing right so I think that that same idea can be applied to any part of an organization like if you're in CX or you're in uh you know like in the sales or or you know any of these other places you can create almost this like internal newsletter within your company that's going to like help create Clarity for everybody else and this is very important especially when you get to that kind of like those those Breaking Point numbers of companies right when you hit 30 30 employees things start to get weird because you can't know everybody in the organization when you hit 100 employees it's the same deal and then you know it's basically that it's like the law of eight or whatever so it's like when you have two people only have to worry about you and their like the relationship between you two when there's three people like it's like a factorial where it's like increasing with every node that you add to the system and so as you know you can think about this as you scale up it's and and makes sense right like the best companies are good memo writers and that's it's that same idea but let's let's let's flip the switch a little bit like what if it's just an internal podcast or what if it's a newsletter that and a podcast that's like here's like you know here's the leadership of this or part of the organization and I mean this is actuallya a company lar I was thinking like not a company like you know you every company Ben would benefit from from this like overcommunication understanding what other people are doing like writing key takeaways and Lessons Learned but the problem is everyone is so busy doing their job and everyone's work to their bones but if there was a company that came in um and imagine every find Friday and you called it like recap right like all hands recap or something and like you just interviewed the heads of growth at that like org and like all of their like you know their direct reports like cool what happened this week and it was just like a you led the interview to uncover the interesting pieces record that I mean you could do this in like Riverside or zoom and then you take that and you just create a transcript have ai list the key insights put like you know do some like light editing and then put that in public within the slack channel it's like cool here's our weekly like as a CEO like hell yeah I would pay for that I want to know what everybody's doing and what's happening right if you're telling me that I can sit down on like my Saturday morning with my coffee or even my Sunday with my coffee and I can listen to the recap from every order like every P like every or within my organization or my sub org like and it takes me an hour of time to listen through those 10 minutes or even if they're five minute episodes like that would provide so much value to me I I think you could easily sell that for 5K plus a month like starts that are getting to that that weird point so I I think it can even be like just voice notes like I would you know yeah just send me if it was even a slackbot that was just like oh super yeah yeah just a slackbot that like DMS me or or or teams bot and it's just like hey hey Greg it's you know here's there's there has to be a prompt so would you learn this week one key story whatever prompt so there come you know there's a bank of prompts that change and maybe you can have tot as the CEO can you can kind of play Puppeteer a bit tailor that today I want you know it was a really tough week this week so like maybe let's do like wins for the week and then yeah yeah everyone gets like how's the morale of your staff right like like we're down 10% that like week over week or something how's everybody feeling and then it's just like okay cool like that bubbles up and you you suddenly get this qualitative feedback and I I I think that this is like actually where AI is the most effective it's like taking unstructured data and structuring it that's when the magic happens right like I don't care about generative AI from like nothing to something it's way more interest like a head shot Pro where it takes a Hu a person and it like turns them into like these this this this output that I'm looking to get created like or I like with what we're doing at Swell where it's like okay we take a a webinar and we turn it into a blog post that's in like your tone style and voice of your brand that's way more interesting than just like having AI right based off its general knowledge or like having AI you fabricate a person into existence right so damn I knew we were going to come up with like a $10 million year business on the Fly 100% I think you could do that you should do that you have the you have the reach like how hard is it for you to find operators like like zero to one Founders like I get asked this all the time like where do I like I want to find you know I need a I want to do a a a REV share or a partnership with somebody give them 20% of ifs and like have some type of earnout you know earn in structure like is that like your job is that basically what you're doing is just like trying to find these people like what is your day-to-day that's actually what I'm curious about it's like kind of like within your holding code like what does that look like well the I'll answer both those questions the first question finding these operators first of all they don't like to be called operators like news flash it's something that I learned because I would call them operators be like bro stop calling me an operator like I'm a I'm a CMO or I'm a you know I've run a a startup CEO or you know I I'm a person I'm not just like playing with levers yeah that's amazing so that's number one um how hard is it and it's it's it's so hard to find them uh so I'm actually like trying to think I'm kind of working on some ideas that make it easier to find those people similar to how Eric torberg started on Deck um back dude I'm obsessed with that episode by the way I listen to it like on a weekly basis I have some we could we could go down that rabbit hole if you want to I have some ideas in that space that I didn't even include on the dock we already tested some of them like AI news for specific categories daily thing I want to at the end we'll go through those because I'm just I need to know like I literally need to know um totally but yeah torberg you know right now on De is kind of like a cohort-based uh you know learn to become a product manager you know learn to be a designer but how it started was in the name on De Eric would throw these dinner parties and cocktail parties and brunches where smart people who were working at Google Facebook whatever who were on Deck to do their next thing like they weren't ready to quit their job but they were like the smartest people at Google the smartest people at Facebook he would just invite them for dinner and super interesting yeah and and he just like his thesis was eventually these people are going to start companies and when they start companies I want to be involved and the alpha is in get and so I think there's probably like what we've been talking about internally is been how do we bring together operators and what is that I think that's hard in a digital space like that's the one thing I'll say about being in a physical location that has high density of like Talent yes is that there's that cross like I even miss SF like for that reason right it's like you go to dinner with some you know a friend of a friend and they're doing some random thing that was like applicable and useful to the moment that you were in and it was just like this it created this um you know Serendipity it was like a you know it multiplied dip bitty opportunities like being in a talent dense place and uh I don't know how to do that like in a digital I think that some some of what we you know you do right where it's like I build uh you know I do podcasts and I build all these this media which creates like inbound of those types of people that are interesting like it creates more surface area I so I'd love to your thoughts on this this is how I think about it and talk about it to people is like like when you're a company and you're just starting out and like anybody like even a personal brand like you want to build digital Mass on the internet so that you create more digital gravity so that you get more people in your rotation which over time leads to more people like touching down into your business and then that creates more digital mass and that's like a growth flywheel right um I think this is actually a better way to think about like funnels funnels I think are broken because that's not actually how people like make purchasing decisions they don't start here and then like work their way down that's a very poor visualization what's actually happening is like they're a comet and they're zooming by your business and if you don't have enough digital Mass they just miss you entirely but the more mass you have they get like trapped in their orbit and then they get like there's moments when they're closer to the planet and like farther away from the planet within that given like rotation but over time they get closer and closer so that they like basically hit like they touch down right and then every time they touch down like that's a purchasing decision that happens and that makes more mass for your business because now you have more Capital to redeploy into the growth of the company and so like anyways that's just like my I I want to write a book on this and just call it digital gravity because it's like how to build like companies like how to build early stage companies that like nobody knows about because it's it's this idea right it's like anyway like we could talk about this like owned media like this is the future and this is how you do this is like owned media is this like Leverage point that any company can do like that starting out like I and I've I've done this personally for Brands where it's like no one knows they exist and a year later they're at a conference and they're like oh my God Sarah I listen to your podcast every week like what you guys are doing is unbelievable we love the product and like again like I mean this was in a the one I'm referencing was like in the insurance space like a very traditional industry that's like handshakes and like good old boy type [ __ ] right and like you basically can break through that when you provide some type of media to that audience that they want to consume and that isn't available and like this is actually a business I want to pitch to you right now so I think that there's a huge opportunity to make podcasts just based off the title of people's like their job titles so make podcasts based off of people's job titles for example head of heads of growth historically they have huge access to Capital because their job is just to grow companies as fast as they can right so if I made a podcast that every head of growth listen to and like literally just name it the head of growth podcast right and all we you do is you interview heads of growth about what they're seeing on the front lines in their business the challenges they're facing all of that and then you take that and you build an email list that to that entire audience and you send out that podcast on a weekly like basis you have a form at the bottom that's like uh you know want to be on the show like you know click this link to like you know basically like come to you so you get this guest inbound that naturally happens but the way to monetize is that I think people are doing wrong right now like they're trying to go and sell advertising I think that's a terrible way to do this I think you've convinced me that Community is actually something that people like want in actually a good business model and you then create a school that's the head of growth school like like that paid Community or a [ __ ] or whatever and you put that in the email newsletter and you promote it within the episode and when you think about that person like okay I'm ahead of growth and I can run a credit card you know up to a thousand dollar without talking to anybody right so if you make that community at $199 a month and then again on a weekly basis you're just like dropping all the knowledge that you've acquired from all the conversation you've had like here's all the Tactical things we're seeing all these other companies doing like you're just interviewing community members on like what's working and what's not you can do it anonymously as well so there's like you know not there's not like this competitiveness between it but like I think that you know there's 16,000 heads of growth in the US with that job title that I can get emails to right now like if you got even a thousand of them to be on a list that's paying you $199 a month right like that's a quarter of a million a month like that's unbelievable company that's just one of like 20 different head of growth positions you could or head of XYZ positions you could do this for scale that up to Cosmos scale that out up to these other things like I think that's like actually the business model for this is like you're using the podcast as the vehicle for community and it's a perfect channel for it because there's so much trust built into it already right if I sit down and I talk to people like every week and I put that in front of all these like other people and they listen to that like an hour of me talking with somebody else like there's going to be so much trust built into that relationship so when I tell them hey we have this private community that has all of these other people sharing their strategies and tactics I mean it's a no-brainer of course I'm going to pay for that like that's just Alpha that I just get for that cheap it's so anyways I I'm curious your thoughts there and like what you guys are kind of seeing because I know like uh that torb is doing something in this world but we've been yeah I mean this that's the future so that's the future the only only word I would change in in that whole rant that you did is instead of calling a community I call it a membership cool so yep membership program or like a yeah so what's the difference between a community and a membership a community is just other people sharing information IRL Events maybe digital events digital there's no exclusivity built into that membership to me is community but it could also be like deals it could be like software it could be just bundling all this value think of think of it as like here's a group of people and you're bundling a bunch of value where Community is just a piece of it and that's like what and it can still live on school or whatever platform that makes sense for whatever Community it is but I think why everyone would do this is because everyone's trying to level up as head of growth everyone's trying to level up as CMO so if you can just Jam a bunch of value into a membership all that you have to to do to make sure that this works this business model works is you just need to make sure that whatever you're charging people are getting at least 5x value so so for examp I mean I'm just thinking about yeah just doing a deal with HubSpot right that membership buy like remember buying is that what it's called where you like you blind you buy a block let's say you buy like a a whole cow and you buy it with six people right is that what it is yeah um so that same idea like you could go to HubSpot and be like yo we have a thousand head of growth totally would membership 100% right it's like cool 50% discount for a yearly subscript like a yearly subscription for x amount of seats and then boom right there like you just got all the value provided to them from that single deal I've been testing this model so I could scale it so I did it myself a lot of things you ask me what I do dayto day I I I don't do like I'll build things on my own a lot of the times to just learn a space or just like get you know from 92% Clarity to % Clarity so for example we launched this thing called Community empire.co which is a paid membership of people building community based businesses that are cash flowing without investors okay so I built it on school but also you get like $50,000 off of a bunch of deals so like we did deals with a bunch but also it comes with a free school it also comes with all this other stuff and it comes with events and it all these things and then that's when I realized oh my God if this can work for this job job title or this type of person this can work for other other functions as well and and by the way just just to put numbers to that like without even trying like literally without even trying that paid membership is doing $37,000 a month that's insane insane that's insane have I told you like how I grow podcasts for like B2B or like has Jordan I think I've told Jordan but I don't know if it got bubbled up to okay so my whole strategy is like go like what's your target iccp the way I do this for startups before tell me the story and then I want I want to end with one more idea for for folks I love it let's do it let's do it so um for early stage companies like they've got like an inkling of product Market fit they kind of have this target ICP and they're like we don't know how to get in front of them or how to Market to them it's like my whole strategy is just this it's like build a podcast specifically for them the customer conversations you're already having distribute it to those people so how do you actually do this so you go and find like all those people's emails on like one of these service providing tools like Apollo or snow or whatever and you take that whole list and you're like cool I've got my toll Target ICP and then what I do is like this is super gray hat but I like grow these podcast newsletters that are all they're doing is promoting the podcast to these people that have that Target like IB so say it's product managers right and like you're building a tool that helps product managers build like internal tools more effectively so you then go and you interview product managers about their job and all product managers want to hear what other product managers are doing so when you grow this list and like what how we actually grow this is like we add like 200 emails a day to this list and what we'll see is like 50 plus percent open rates and like three to five% click-through rates on these these emails this is a cold email that we landing in people's inboxes and they're 50% opening and like over 5% clicking right or like over 3% clicking so the subject line is literally like podcast and then it's like whatever the most insightful part like of the of the episode was it's just that that is the subject line and then all the email says is like the newest episode of XYZ podcast is live click this link to like to listen to it it takes them right to the Apple podcast URL and then below that it's like you know maybe a two paragraph summary and like five bullet points and then it's like at the bottom it's like hope you find this educational cont content like valuable link to whoever the founder is that's hosting the show and then maybe you add like a call to action like six months into this that's at the bottom of like whatever the name of the company is so what so that's one piece of this the second piece is then you run Facebook ads to iOS only devices and you take that same group of people you do a customer match list and you put clips of the episodes in front of them with a link to click the Apple podcasting link now when they click that link it's technically a deep link on iOS devices so because you're targeting iOS devices it opens the Apple podcasting app on their phone and drops them right into the podcast episode they hit play download so the other thing you can do with that is you can also run ads that are the same thing as this other deep linking uh strategy but it's basically you put like podcast like literally the word podcast colon in front of the RSS feed and again when you're on mobile devices and when you're on Apple devices it prompts the user to open the Apple podcasting app and then there's a popup that says like subscribe right it's literally like a subscri like it's dropping them into like subscribing to the podcast when they subscribe to the podcast they immediately download that episode when the new the new episode gets dropped but the bigger thing is that built into the iPhone and the Apple podcasting app when you the the shows you're subscribed to they give they do push notifications so you just created a push notification to that like Target customers like mobile device like to their to their phone and then the other thing we layer on top of that is then podcast SEO like why am I obsessed with you naming this to the you know the like business ideas right like it's because if you now go to the Apple podcasting app and you search business ideas who comes up and it is your show Greg right and so we do that same thing but at a smaller scale so like call it again like using this product manager I call it the product manager you know podcast right again just as as literal as you can be with this and when you combine that all together like we've taken these I'm working with my friend who's in the biotech space like we've taken their show from non existent to like a top 20 Life Sciences podcast in the US in less than 12 months um they now do like 30,000 downloads a month and like they they have a link that's like want you know want you uh want to be on the show like are you a Founder like of a biotech company like we want you on the show like apply here they get VCS inbounding into their form pitching their portfolio companies to come on this show like this is their ICP is getting warm leaded into them from their investor like that is the what is happening here The Leverage that they just like cultivated within their industry like again this is an early stage company with 15 employees they can now go in and negotiate with massive organizations and they're already doing this with like the Roan gen you know gencs of the world because they have this media arm that they use as The Leverage point for those relationships impossible otherwise so anyway yeah um it's like something I'm I'm super about and I feel like it's related to this like you could get these what you're talking about where it's like job title to community like in 12 months that company could easily be doing like I I I bet you could get it to 300K a month in like 12 months probably just that using that entire Playbook that we just talked about so you're you're my people man you're you get it you get it give me give us one last idea okay um the one I'm most excited about because I think it's like a huge opportunity and I also just like I think it it would help the Uber driver right that has it is this thing called play octopus so I don't know if you guys like you everybody's seen this but it's like imagine like a tablet that's on the back of like a headrest um that's in the back of like an Uber uh like when you're you know going somewhere so that tablet they just do like trivia but like if you've ever been in a car like especially in XL with one of these like the whole car just gets like fired up about this like my my girlfriend loves this right like we'll sit there and we're like coming home from the bar like Thursday beers right and we're just ripping through these it's like there's a high score and this leaderboard and it's this whole thing and then how they make money is they do ads in between the trivia so I'm like again coming home from Thursday beers the other night naturally I'm like chatting up this you know my Uber driver because that's the type of person I am I am that annoying [ __ ] sometimes and I'm like oh where you from blah BL blah and he's like Ethiopia blah BL blah and I start asking him about the tablet I'm like how much you make off the tablet a month and he's like oh it's nothing like $70 I'm like you only make $70 off of this being in here he's like yes I'm like how many rides a month you do and he throws out some crazy number and I'm like that's insane and then I start asking him I'm like okay why do you keep it if it's like not that problem he's like well it's here already so why would I get rid of it and so and also like it makes the people that ride with me like happier like they become like I have like better ride like Vibes because this is here so for me it makes it it makes my job better so let's break that down he's getting paid nothing there's no churn and it's a better experience for everybody in the car okay so that company play octopus got bought by T-Mobile in 2022 um if you look up like what the revenues are doing it's right around like that eight to 10 million dollar Mark the ads they're running are just display ads like it's nothing it's nothing so how I would make this company better and how's somebody out there please do this please for the love of God do this is I would go and I'd do this exact same thing I would do the trivia thing but the ads that I would show would be CPA ads with a with a QR code that when the person scanned it and gave their contact information their phone number or their email there's an affiliate commission that happens to the company so to whatever this company company x that you create but also to the Uber driver so that's the incentive for them to switch to have the switching cost so instead of $70 like you can get some of the like I'm just thinking like cpg Brands like a lot of the times like they'll pay like $3 for some these email right like if they're like you know whatever uh some like kosi cereal like that is like that is not uncommon now if you give like 10% of that to this person or even like you know you do a 50/50 share you're going to make so much more money than 8 to1 million a year and I think that this could be run with like a team of like five engineers and like one salesperson that just is like all he does is like get in these groups and tries to sell these people the the the power of this though like the natural natural the natural Network effect that will happen is that all of these drivers or all in these like group groups and so as soon as you know homie from Ethiopia is like yo I'm making an extra $500 a month off of this because I implemented it like every one of the he's going to drop that in this group and every one of those drive you make some type of uh referral program between them all so I just think that that is like you know it's a great product with terrible monetization and I think that there's a better way to monetize that space and make more money both like it's all the all the incentives are align there and all and I think you couldn't do when you know play octopus initially came out right people weren't used to scanning QR codes that wasn't a part of their daily life they're now used to that and so you could basically increase the like the in I don't know what the offers would be it could be local it could be National I'm not sure like that's the hardest part of this is probably like creating the uh whatever that affiliate network is but there's I mean imagine you could just like tap into like CJ or like you know one of these like affiliate networks and look at the the CPA offers that are there and then just like throw those up so yeah that's the the other business that I'm like it's more of a physical thing and it's a higher lift but I excited about it a few a few thoughts so firstly the affiliate offers I'm thinking about the driver like they don't even have to be like I buy this thing and I get a cut like it could be like athletic greens where athletic greens affiliate offer is like you get a share of it monthly for 12 months I believe yep so I think that could be like they would love that um second thing is it could also be like cost per lead not just CPA so it could be like y you know the grocery store pay totally you know two bucks for or dollar or. 75 cents for the right to message you about stuff and it's like scan this QR code to get like something you give them something for free like an ebook a PDF I don't know what you give them but you give them something and then they can contact you so I think like yes I think and then I think your framework around finding good products that have bad monetization is just like a really smart way way of thinking about it because there's other ideas I mean totally and and to piggyback off of what you said on like the cost like the cost per uh like you know cost per lead Etc like what a lot of them do is they then bundle like so like basically like imagine like a Kroger and like um you know a tire shop and uh you know some other type of business they alt together they want that same lead so they'll pay it's not you know $2 they'll pay $6 and they all share that lead and they do some type of initial offer but that list get shared to all of them right and there's a way that like you could like it could be a huge payout right like where it's like it could be 10 bucks per lead that you're generating and if you scale that up to the entire us and I think you could get these tablets like to them like for free too right it's like you just put them in here and like money starts coming in like not $70 like on average the people that drive with this like they make $1,000 a month after six months because there's some type of like you know maybe it's a recurring subscription payout or whatever so yeah I mean I I again I think a huge business is right there easily a $10 million a year I mean it's already A10 million business just improve it it's like make it a $50 million here's a really bad I'm I'm gonna give a really bad we're gonna end on a really bad idea based based on a pivot of your idea a bad idea that makes the world a worst place but probably can print so we take your screens in the back of uber idea except we turn them into casinos so holy God like a Candy Crush oh my God yeah so bedding is becoming you know legal and more I bet you could do it with the betting companies all yeah you just go and do a partnership with them and you you you buy some games or and then you basically and you also do like Greg that's a hundred million dollar your company cuz like I'm just thinking about my my friends like coming home from the bars and they're already lit and you got like oh here's a $100 free and and free B betting credits if you scan this QR code nine times out of 10 they're going to scan that QR code also you know you can do you can do like prediction Market betting so it's like imagine it's like election day and it's like is Biden going to win in an hour and there just a countdown on the screen you're like do you want to place a bet for $ five dollar see you know people would just there you have a captured audience 100% 100% make the world the worst maybe what you do worst plays oh worst place again company will print somebody please go do this so that we can ride along with you but I think if I was going to Market with that like I would focus on the CPA or so I would do it for the like the offers for like FanDuel Etc to begin with and then you could do like what you're talking about after that and like make it even more cool where it's like live with something that's happening but like you could get I think initial monetization with I'm just thinking about it too like how many people go like you everybody takes an Uber to like sports game right like that is like one of the big ways that people get around like that and like music basically like both of those places like you know specifically to sports like that's like a sports betting company's like dream is to have a captured audience that's headed to ball Arena you know to watch the Nuggets play so anyway yeah that's super interesting Cody Schneider this was everything I dreamed it would be and more thank you for coming if people want to hear more learn more about swell and and just get you more in their feed which they should I encourage it where can they do it yeah I'm so I'm most active on Twitter and Linkedin um and uh yeah swell ai.com is the company we're currently building it's an AI content marketing engine uh for B2B companies and yeah I mean you honestly you should just Google my name if I don't come up I'm really bad at my job so uh that that is probably the easiest way to to find me hell yeah man all right well I'll catch you later I appreciate it thanks for having me Greg

men's interest in health is at an all-time high you look at one of the bestselling books of the last 12 months is the Peter AA book the fastest growing podcast of last year is the Andrew hubman podcast so I think like you look at the longevity space right now it used to be this thing that like the Nerds were interested in and now it's becoming cool now it's kind of breaking through to the mainstream and so there's going to become this like booming anti-aging Market I think men are going to become more and more proactive about maintaining kind of like a youthful appearance both professionally and personally start up by this time [Music] baby and we are off so sipping with Jason Jason I need my drink huh all right what are you drinking I have three drinks lined up for today depending on how the podcast goes we've got coffee if you really put me on the hot seat we've got a lroy if you decide to take it easy and we've got a water if uh this go is planned okay well we'll see we'll see at the end um you've got you got some fire ideas so I want to get right into it um AI coo for companies what do you mean by that okay basically I think that so how let me I'll let me flip this on you for a sec how many people work at your hold like uh how many people work inside your the holding company prob about 115 okay yeah so block workor today has we're about I think we're about to hit 70 I'm pretty sure uh we might end the year around 90 85 um the problem that I've seen happen is the coordination problem inside of companies so and specifically inside of blockworks right now so what I mean by this my first idea that I want to lay out here is like I think there's a real opportunity to build an AI either coo or chief of staff I don't really know what you call it where you basically every slack every email every ocean every Google doc assana jira everything that is written inside of the company gets pulled into basically this large AI database you basically need the founder to opt in and you need to uh you need everyone at the company to know that they are joining this thing this company where like there is opt in from day one right that's one probably one of the problems is some employees if you bring it to a larger company wouldn't want to do this but I think from if you had a small enough company where you could get everyone to opt in or if you could find a Founder who wanted to do this from day one if you pulled every single message again including personal private DMS on slack all that kind of stuff had the understanding that no one could read those messages except for this AI um I think you could actually build a really useful tool that ends up having a lot of these benefits inside of a company and why coo versus you know data scientist or CFO or what what what makes you think that coo is the most interesting place to start the problem that exists I'm I'm only speaking from personal knowledge here is because blockworks is the first you know we've been running blockworks for six and a half years and it's really the first like quotes around this real business but the problem that we have is uh is again the coordination and communication problem as the company scales so what I end up dealing with a lot and I know other Executives and leaders and just other people at the company deal with a lot is hey what is this person working on this week hey is anyone here working on this hey do we have a document that shows the product road map hey do you have any idea what the um you know the ARR was in Q2 compared to q1 what I found is when I step away let's say someone messages me I have a tendency to message I respond very quickly on slack if I don't respond for like a day the problem usually gets solved in some way and so I think that there's a lot of time that people end up spending inside of companies just answering these like menial little question questions where uh the usually the solution is a company Wiki so what's evolved is like a company Wiki um there's some tools for this I think a lot of people now startups do it on notion but that doesn't really solve it because Notions Pages even though I want to love them they end up often times sucking and there's like it's really hard to find things and I think that just like this one you could basically just call it a company chatbot would really solve it even things like you know we have new hires who just started I think we had four or five new hires who started this month and I heard that they're asking hey how long does Jason so my co-founder's name is Mike hey how long does Jason usually take to respond to a slack hey how long does Mike usually take to respond to a slack that's like uh it's this weird little menial question doesn't really make a big impact but it kind of does on a person's life so there are all these different questions that you could ask it anything from hey How long does it usually take Greg to respond to a slack all the way up to hey what was the revenue last quarter hey do we have a document that shows our product road map hey do you know if anyone's working on the graphic for the Das uh for our event redesign like all all of the kind of things yeah I think that's a really good framework for any sort of agent type experience whenever you have a bunch of Google docs or a ocean and you want the ability to extract that information in a really interesting way like there's probably an agent business there exactly ex I mean that's that's what I think it so this is of all of the ideas I had right I had some like some boring ideas some you know crypto ideas this one is really tough because I think one of the mistakes Founders end up making is they don't think if I'm success they don't think about if I'm successful what will the business be in five years and who will I be competing against and who you're competing against here in five years is Google Salesforce and slack and they have the Tableau business obviously as well Microsoft right because if this is successful Google says oh we I mean let's just build this in right so you end up that's why I that's why this is probably my least favorite of the ideas but I had to had to bring some you know sexy AI idea to the table of course you had to it's 24 you know you got to you got to um no I think uh I do like that framework though and I think even if you it it doesn't become a big business if you can extract you know a few million dollars out of it in a short amount of time there's still it could be still lifechanging yeah um what's your what's your favorite idea on this list let's go let's go to that one there are a couple ideas that I would do if I think I'd tee this up by basically saying I think I I've seen you talk a lot about this on Twitter and stuff like the nature of building a business is changing today right we're at a we're at a turning point in building companies and I've seen you tweet about you know how I think it makes a lot of sense not to take Venture money today and I think all of that I completely agree with a lot of those takes so a lot of these are built on the back of this idea that look in 2008 if you knew how to code you probably had a better chance of building a SAS product in a space you maybe didn't know much about compared with someone with deep expertise because you knew how to code and because you could go build this SAS product because software is just such a powerful thing but today because it is so easy to just spin up a company with these SAS products and with these AI tools I think deep domain expertise is now actually popular and Powerful again and I think you're going to see this like this entire generation of Founders who basically take that belief that it's super easy to build a company today and this idea that like maybe the original idea of hey we don't have to be profitable let you know everyone said we don't have to be profitable look at Amazon there's a whole generation of VCS that invested in companies on that one idea of hey we don't have to be profitable look at Amazon I think that's changing so some of the ideas that I really like there's probably two here um one is around actually Men's Health and specifically hair transplants Botox um if you look at basically Women's Health uh the women's Personal Care Market went from 27 billion in 1997 to 511 billion right it grew about 20x in the last 25 years I think the men's care Market is about to do the same thing so that there's one idea we could talk about there with Men's Health and like something I'd probably build around that it's a very unsexy business in-person physical you have to build physical offices and then there's I would probably do what I did with blockworks again because I just I think this idea of like creating a negative CAC SAS business is probably the only way to build a successful SAS business today in my mind so I want to I want to unpack that negative CAC piece in a bit because I I need I need to understand what you mean by it but I want to start with the botox for men not because I not because I need Botox you know just putting that out there just just saying for anyone who's not watching on YouTube I don't need Botox I don't need Botox and and if you don't believe me and you're listening to this go on YouTube let me know if I need Botox um but I do I have noticed that I've seen a lot of advert I live in Miami you know this and in Miami you know plastic surgery Botox it's everywhere and I have noticed that like 90 plus% of the marketing the images is of women like do you know of a leading men's Botox brand I don't I don't know of any of them and okay so here's here's where this idea originally came from the idea originally came from my friend who started losing his hair really quickly and he went to try to get he looked at the market and he tried like hyms and there's a pill that he was taking what's it a ran and it wasn't working so then he's like oh let me go try to get like hair transplant or hair plugs or whatever he's like I I saw a picture of Elon Musk it looks pretty good uh let me go you know Tom Brady like clearly got this let me go check it out and all of the best places in New York for hair transplants had a two-year waiting list a two-year waiting list to go get a hair transplant and this is a you know I don't I don't know how much it cost but I the procedure is like you know 20 or 30 or $40,000 to get right so this is a 2-year weight list to go pay $40,000 for something so that's when the idea started kind of like like okay there's there's something there so started looking into it what's happening is I think we're basically at like lasic eye surgery was 20 years ago for hair transplants um if you wanted to get like lasic eye surgery 20 years ago very like very risky very expensive long recovery process and that's what it is today for a hair transplant for men uh 40% of men go fully bald 70% of men experience balding in their life and you're selling to basically this massive Market of men who are honest just to be candid like pretty desperate if they're losing their hair like what you're seeing with the technology right now there used to be this old technology called fut where they would like take a scar like rip you know rip hairs out of your head and like you'd be left with a big scar now they can do it without any of the scarring so you're like we just hit this like technological precipice where I think we're on the other side of it but all the doctors who have the clinics they all practice the old thing um and they're all set up as these like old doctor's offices so yeah that I mean there's a lot of Reason like there's more I could ramble on about why I'm excited about this but that's that's like a really interesting area I think you could do hair transplants layer on men's Botox create like a kind of luxury feel that Fe feels very exclusive and yeah I think that that would be a really successful business so first of all i' love this idea like I feel like it's one of those ideas that would work like just would work with a high probability that it would work How would how would you go about let's starting this like what what steps would you take if you actually wanted to start this if I actually wanted to start this you need the I mean you need a doctor and you need a this is a perfect celebrity business right so you need a doctor and you need a celebrity and I don't think what you so there's the there's some Chicago Bears middle linebacker who got hair transplants bald guy I forget his name um and he was like plastered all over the Billboards I don't think you need those celebrities the first thing I would do is I would go get a you got to get a doctor so I look this up you need a doctor and you need two assistants basically because the way it works is they take the hair out of the back of your head put it on the front of your head so you need like the doctor to do that and the assistants to help with that so you that's three employees that you need you need a physical space so let's say you're paying a doctor 200 you know maybe let's say 300K a year each assistant is 100k a year so that's 500k a year uh maybe you need space in person in New York so that's 20K a month so that's another 250 a year so that's 750k a year right there of costs and then I think what you need is a celebrity that's like big on Tech Twitter so I would pick like a you know you have great hair but if you were balding I'd go to a Greg Eisenberg I'd go to S par or Austin Reef or Kevin Rose or you know maybe I'd go to Tim Ferris all the people you said before that great hair great hair they got great flow so I'd go to Tim be like Tim man you know how you've been losing your hair let me get your hair back I can get your hair back and you need like one or two success stories and the good thing about this is I mean you can charge let's say $50,000 and you can do one a day I think you can do one a day per doctor so I don't know I don't I'm trying not to do mental math these days in public but 50 * 365 is almost $20 million so that's 20 million bucks per location per doctor um that's that's how I would start it I also wonder you know would I want to start it in Manhattan like at $20,000 a month of rent or like the people in is it just because the you know New Yorkers are willing to pay that amount you know I I think you want I think you want to do that yeah I think you want to go to New York San Francisco or Miami where you know my like the way my friend put it he's like I'd pay whatever to get you know he works in private Equity um and he's just like yeah i' get I'd pay whatever to get my hair back I think you can basically yank the prices up and uh folks will not respond too much to the increase in pricing it would be cool if you can also do it in like a three-day Retreat weekend it's like hey I'm going to Upstate New York for three days and it's like a detox weekend and I also like they also there's a doctor there and he also does my hair okay so turkey is the hair transplant capital of the world if you ever fly back from Turkey you will see guys with bandages all across their head and a lot of these places you'll pay let's say $5,000 for the hair transplant because it's a lot cheaper there so you pay 5,000 there and then you'll pay another 5,000 for a two-e retreat because the first two weeks are I like if you look at the pictures like it's pretty gnarly so you you know you don't really want to be in public you don't want to walk around so you end up just like staying in your home all day but yeah I think you nailed it you would probably do some sort of like luxury Retreat yeah that's exactly right and Botox like tell me tell me why you think you know BOTOX for men is a good idea um a couple reasons one is Botox and women is just the fastest or second fastest growing like women's uh self-care Personal Care uh like area it used to be like Beauty and it's out past Beauty and makeup and all that kind of stuff um I don't I don't know why maybe the plastic surgery has gotten better but if you if you look at some of the men's data so lipos suction is actually the fastest growing area I just feel like I wouldn't want to maybe get into the lipos suction Arena I don't know but that's the fastest growing area then hair transplants than Botox actually so I don't know why I have this aversion to lipo section but I'd probably do hair transplants and then yeah some sort of Botox and injections um again I think what you need there is there's a stigma associated with getting Botox so you need to create a very like exclusive luxury H like I would call it high privacy place where there's a lot of trust that nobody knows that you're going to this place um and the one of the reasons I think this is going to work like men's interest in health is at an all-time high you look at one of the bestselling books of the last 12 months is was the it was the Peter AA book right you look at the fastest growing podcast of last year is the Andrew huberman podcast so I think like there's the clear interest and then I think um you look at the longevity space right now like longevity is now becoming it used to be this thing that like the Nerds were interested in now the Nerds and the billionaires and now it's becoming cool now it's kind of breaking through to the mainstream and so there's going to become this like booming anti-aging Market as men are I think men are going to become more and more proactive about maintaining kind of like a a youthful appearance um both professionally and personally um and if you like I don't know we we have a lot of like Millennials and genz at blockworks and it's very clear that men take their I don't know when I graduated college and like just started a job like I know every dude just looked the same like everyone's like wearing like a slubby button down with like some bad tucked in jeans like tucked in pants all the guys look good now right people are taking their appearance much more uh seriously and I think it's got a lot of Tailwinds behind it yeah yeah I think just in general framework wise longevity like that space there's thousands of businesses to be built in the longevity space um I also think longevity for pets is talk a lot about I've been thinking a lot about that um you know people love their their dogs their cats whatever and you know they get older and it's sad it gets very very sad you know a lot of people would pay a lot of money to extend their dog's life by two three four five years yeah I mean there's when people think longevity I think the first area that people go into is like some pills or supplements or something like everyone's I feel like got their own supplement brand now but yeah I think there's a pretty like unsexy boring physical business to be built here the reason you should not build this business is I bet the lawsuits are rampant in this industry I don't I don't know what it looks like but I bet this dealing with insurance and dealing with like customers who are angry that their hair doesn't look as flowy as they thought it would I bet that would would be a nightmare to deal with but yeah I think the the benefits outweigh the costs but that would probably be the reason not to go into it my uh my brother's a doctor and he he once went to Las Vegas I think he was speaking at an Opthalmology lasc conference so it was it was actually a conference where all the top doctors who did lasic surgery came in Las Vegas and at this time I was thinking I'm wear I wear glasses I was thinking should I get lasic a lot of my friends were getting it so I asked them I said hey like just curious what percentage of the doctors in that room were wearing the glasses and I expected him to say like I don't know 1% 5% a very small percentage right cuz these are people who do lasic so you you'd expect them right you'd expect them to to to not wear glasses but he was like n you know 85 90% of people were wearing glasses he was like it was the most amount of glasses I I had seen in a really long time and I asked him why and he said because they know that it's like a point you know six% chance that you'll lose some vision so they know the risks they've seen they've seen the horror stories yeah they've seen how the sausage is made yeah yeah well at this point I don't know how the sausage is made so I still think this is a good idea yeah it's one of those it's one of you know why I wouldn't do this idea is like I don't know enough about it so it's like do your research believe in it don't just like build a business to make money but like and also there are some like botox specifically there are like a bunch of benefits I think um that go beyond like youthful aging like for example I get migraines sometimes and like botox is actually really good for migraines yeah I I I have these things called cluster headaches which are a nightmare and uh Botox has been recommended as well so yeah um but yeah I agree I also think like the Brian Johnson Johnson fication I guess of of everything is just men are just really are interested in it I saw YouTube I saw a video of him uh where it was like an MTV Cribs kind of like interview where he was showing his house and he looks like like the title is like this man looks 20 years old and like the top comment on YouTube was like he just looks really slippery he looks 50y but he looks really slippery he does look a little like lizardy aleny but I just yeah I mean look at huberman petera like uh Brian Johnson like these these weird like Health folks areel celebrities now that's never happened in the history of the US or the world I don't know so yeah exactly so I like this idea interesting T you know you talked about this negative CA software piece like what what do you mean by that yeah basically if okay so another business I would build is just a B2B Niche media brand um I think for first time Founders um I am convinced that building a B2B niche media brand is the best way to go make your first buck um if you want and to I don't know maybe you could go exit like look at what uh Austin and Alex did with morning Brew like sold it for what 70 million or something like that um I think rolled a little Equity like they'll they'll do they'll do just fine off that and um so it's not a billion dollar outcome but because they didn't really go raise a bunch of venture they were able to go make lifechanging amounts of money where neither of them has to work again right and so I think the first thing here before getting into negative CAC is just go build a B2B Niche media brand that's the first thing I would do then if you really want to scale it past that 100 million valuation Mark what I would do is put a product at the bottom of my funnel and what you're going off of there is this model that one of our advisers Craig Fuller uh who runs Freight waves and sonar and a bunch of other things which I can talk about their success well I'll talk about their success now they he built Freight waves into the biggest supply chain media brand and then launched a supply chain data platform at the bottom of that funnel and built that into a $300 million a year business $300 million a year Enterprise Value business that's a completely that's a subscription SAS Data Business so what I mean by negative CAC is if you look at how a lot of software businesses last 20 years fund like do customer acquisition cost they are paying money for marketing right you pay maybe your CAC is $300 or maybe you have a really high value subscriber and it's a it's a ,000 whatever it may be what I mean by negative CAC is what we've built at blockworks so we have a neg we have a negative CAC model very similar to Freight waves and sonar um so we are getting paid to acquire these customers that's what negative CAC means is you get actually get paid to acquire your customers so how that works for blockworks is we have blockworks the media business and then we have blockworks research which is a subscription an Enterprise subscription platform so blockworks media up here is conferences podcasts newsletters news business and we own this audience with several million investors interested in crypto and up here this is a cash flow positive business that spits off a lot of cash but it also serves the purpose of owning the relationship with the audience right where we have these people in our audience so you've got now you've got cash flow and you've got relationship with the audience and then our job is to essentially try to figure out how we can convert even if we convert 0.1% of our audience into the blockworks research platform we have a you know we have a big old business on our hands so that's what I think I think s you saw SAS evolve from like just selling a SAS product into like bundling SAS products into SAS companies trying to turn into platforms like a Salesforce and now the next thing I think that's going to get really hot is hey how do I go build this negative CAC payback period especially in a world where my investors are forcing me to both sign up more customers and decrease the cost of signing up a customer that's basically breaking the laws of SAS physics and I think this negative CAC model uh is is the way to do it could you just using blockworks as an example can you just share like the scale of where you are at how many people are are visiting the properties how big is the audience how much revenue do you drive from maybe an average user just so people get a sense of like similar what they could expect for building a B2B yeah Niche business so block Works launched May 2018 we just started kind of side hustle ideating on it December 2017 officially quit our jobs and launch May 2018 first year of business 250k of Revenue second year of business 2 million of Revenue third year of business three and a. half million fourth year 12 a. half million fifth year 25 a. half million so and we and we didn't raise any Venture that whole time so that was we had no so we had no product at the bottom of the funnel it was all advertising and sponsorship dollars conferences podcasts newsletter and news and so that was basically that was the scale of the media business once we hit that scale we said and we were spitting off enough cash flow we said boom let's go build the product and raise our first round so now so then in May or April 2023 about a year ago we raised 12 million at of 135 post money valuation and that was to basically say look we've got this product at the bottom of the funnel it's growing tremendously we've never spent a dollar on marketing because we already own the relationship with the audience let's go put some fuel on the fire and go hire more engineers and you know analysts and and things like that so that's basically our business model and that's some of the like I guess the behind the scenes of some of the numbers and you know when you started this 2018 there were there were a few other crypto media companies you know so how did you know that there was still opportunity in the space um we picked a niche of a n of a niche so what we when we looked out at the landscape so blockworks is I'll get to that in a sec blockworks is built on this like one thesis and we've got so much wrong over the years but the one thesis was that crypto would eventually become this big institutional asset class and as that happened the number of investors and professionals who came into the industry would grow by orders of magnitude and those investors and professionals were going to demand a much higher quality level of information and we basically said look let's go try to own and build the information stack for those professionals and for those investors and so to get back to your question like when we looked out at the industry there was Twitter Reddit there were a couple podcasts there was like coindesk and coin Telegraph and they all were kind of appealing to like the mass markets like the retail Trader or the retail investor or the college graduate who just bought some Bitcoin we basically said look let's the first couple years of block works we the niche of the niche that we picked was we said we don't care about all all of crypto we're only going to focus on translating the like what's happening in crypto to the old school institutional Capital markets crowd so that's how we were able to have success in the early years as we said uh look there's all these cool things happening in crypto but to get off the ground and kind of fight the 800 pound gorilla at the time which was coindesk we need to just focus on this institutional crowd of crypto we did that for about three or four years and then once we we felt like we were kind of on par with coindesk we said now we can go a little broader but even now I mean we only focus on the deeply crypto native part of the industry we leave a lot of the other things to to other folks to cover um and it's our bet that like the people who matter in the industry are the real crypto professionals and like power crypto users and all the other people are just kind of like passer buyers or they're people that like it just doesn't make sense sense from a media business model perspective to to try to capture that yeah I call that niche of a niche of a niche like I call it a super Niche so it's like you pick your Niche and then okay you got to go deeper so what's your super Niche the interesting thing is the super Niche that you pick turns out it was probably one of the highest value Su like niche of a niche or super Niche right like if you would have we got we got remarkably lucky lucky right like one of the biggest learnings of this is I think it's much better to be a mediocre entrepreneur or have mediocre products in the in a extremely fast growing rocket ship industry then try to be the best entrepreneur in a really bad industry where the the growth rate is zero right because when the growth rate is zero you're basically playing a zero sum game you're you're eating away at someone else's business crypto grows every year so the P the whole pie is expanding um but yeah I mean we we got we got lucky picking like the I mean the fastest growing industry in the world for the last couple of years yeah and I think you can just you can apply this model to B2B but also B Toc like you could you know we should buy longevity.com and you know focus on you know the VC type high high value you know lot of disposable income type people and build a media business around that and then you can sell them products like you can just you you can think of so many different b2c and B2B opportunities with the same model around pick a niche and then pick that super Niche yeah I agree yeah I mean so the other but the other thing you need to think about if you're building a media business is where are the advertising dollars so I have a friend he started another he started B2B Niche media business but it turns out the readers of his newsletter and his listeners of his podcast and the readers of his publication they don't buy many things right so if you're a CMO who is the buyer of an ad you know adverti like runs the ad budget inside of a company for him they only buy conference sponsorships and he learned this a couple years into the business they only buy conference sponsorships so when he goes to them to try to sell newsletter ads well there there's no one there it's not a they're not used to buying that as opposed to our audience our investors if you if you run a coinbase or Fidelity you're very used to buying podcast ads and newsletter ads and things like that so I think it's important to think about like who are the buyers and sellers and what is the supply and demand of the ad Market in the media business that you're launching so how do you know that before it's too late because I'm sure a bunch of people will build a media business and then only realize six months or 12 months or two years even through it that oh wow these these advertisers are pretty sparse and uh I probably should have picked a different Niche I I think you have I mean I don't really I think you have to go talk to people I I think that's the only way um I would though look at existing advertisements that the existing ad market so let's say you're launching like a I don't know let's say you're launching like a wine media business or like a watch media business like the first let's say you're watching a wa launching a watch business uh media business the first thing I would do is probably launch with like just Rolexes and PEX or something like that or maybe just for up and cominging watch people who have a budget of like around 10K like Grand seos like maybe you just want the grand SEO reader or you know who has like 5K to buy a watch so that's like pick your core audience um and the reason like I think that you could go after that crowd is you already know the ad Market's already been like determined for you there's already so many watch brand spending money on Advertising as opposed to going and picking something like I don't know maybe wine where like I honestly don't see many wine ads so yeah that's that's probably how I think about it yeah I I also I also think like using the grand Seiko example funny I was I was talking to Kevin about Kevin Rose about Grand seos too like people who buy Grand seos are particular type of person like they they like to be unique yes like they don't want to follow the crowd they don't want to follow the herd so then you can what you can do if you have a bunch of grand SEO readers what are the other products that non-hard followers would like to buy right I bet the people who buy gr seos are also people who are maybe experimenting with like being sober right now and maybe there's some CBD drinks you could Market to them like so I think there's some overlap you can do I love the generalization on gr SEO enthusiasts I I mean as a as a as an almost Grand SEO purchaser uh I I feel like it's fair to to generalize you uh you want to buy a grand SEO I wanted to buy a watch um for a long time just cuz I don't really own any watches um and I wanted to buy a watch for a long time I could not get myself to invest in to buy something for myself yeah I just I'm I'm I'm cheap I could couldn't uh couldn't get myself to do it well you can you you can start with a Seiko right a Seiko yeah $100 100 bucks yeah yeah see how you feel all right that's enough about Grand seos you know I I gotta ask being that you're you're in crypto land do you have any crypto startup ideas for us so I do I a couple um the most successful crypto Founders are deeply crypto native and what we've we've seen a lot of failures when folks come in from web 2 or from finance and they don't fully drink the Kool-Aid and the the biggest mistake I hear people make when they're pitching is like yeah there's all these crypto nerds over here we're going to go try to build this like a safe crypto consumer app that appeals that brings crypto to the masses that's never worked and it will never work that's not uh that's crypto has grown very Bottoms Up it doesn't grow top down as opposed to maybe something like AI so yeah I think that's one of the big mistakes I am convinced that it was actually um one of our investors Vance van Spencer from framework tweeted this out I that crypto is this is going to sound ridiculous to probably you and a lot of your audience but like I really think crypto is the only real Venture investable vertical that is taking place right now I think if you look at fintech it's effectively dead and consolidating if you look at consumer there haven't been I mean this is your world but like there haven't really been any hits in the last 10 15 years there's like little Sparks of Joy but no real businesses if you look at Enterprise SAS the revenue multiples are like sub 10x now because everyone can compare them to the public markets which makes it non-viable for large VCS and there's a b bunch of competition and I think a lot of SAS companies people have realized they're just sexy front ends for Excel databases then you have like Ander roll and Palmer lucky and stuff like American dynamism defense I think that's interesting but it's only really playable for like the Andre of the world and some of the largest funds and then there's Ai and I think that AI is possibly The Last Hope for some of these huge Giga funds but there's really I don't know how like some of the early stage funds are going to do anything here because you need huge Capital commitments and a lot of the value ACR is going to recruit to the incumbents like a Microsoft or Google or something like that so the setup I think for this conversation is like I do have I think there there will be there will be I think crypto is the best industry in the world to go start a company in but you have to be deeply crypto native and I think you have to lean all the way in um I don't know what you think of that but yeah I mean I I'm as biased as you can possibly get by listen my my honest take is there's definitely some like crypto has been around for now 14 or so years right like it's not going anywhere um yes it's going to have ups and downs but the idea of blockchains decentralization we still haven't seen like a consumer blockchain really hit to your point and maybe that never happens like maybe it just it's more around Defi and stuff like that but yeah I think there's a lot of opportunities but then at the same time I'm like seeing all these like meme coin stuff and it like to me it takes away from the industry to take it seriously so I'm curious what are your thoughts on m coins in general and like do you consider mem coins a you know a venture opportunity yeah I'm here here I'll give you the I'll give you both sides of the argument I think here's the memec coin suck argument memec coin suck because there's all this attention on crypto now that Bitcoin just broke through its all-time high people are looking back at at crypto at you know there's the Bitcoin having this week Black Rock and Fidelity have their Bitcoin ETFs like the space is clearly coming back and we're entering another bull market so all these eyes are on crypto and all we see are these stupid meme coins that's the and it's like guys like come like you're doing what we thought you kids would do playing in your stupid little crypto sandbox you're creating these stupid meme coins that's the that's the that's the meme coins are stupid argument the mem coins a good argument is just that um marketing is harder than ever in today's world like finding attention on the Internet is nearly impossible today you can get these quick little hits maybe a viral tweet or something if you're if you're Greg and you know how to tweet but like for most people marketing is impossible and what you're about to see are a lot of meme coins actually turn into real businesses so you're going to see like the way I think about mem coins right now is there's like the mem coins that you can just kind of speculate on whatever everyone's gonna have fun with those they might actually they definitely will end in tears and then there's going to be the meme coins where like they basically see that as a customer acquisition strategy just like some nft Brands did so if you look at um like the most successful upand cominging exchange today is exchange called backpack they launched on the back of an nft Community called madlads right so their user acquisition strategy was let's go get 10,000 people to buy our nfts and then boom we'll launch a crypto exchange and now they're the fastest growing I think the the or one of the fastest growing crypto exchanges right now because they had this baked in audience of people who own the nfts uh torians right torians were another nft Community they launched the tensor nft exchange they're one of the top five nft exchanges out there pudgy Penguins um doing the same thing and you actually saw one there's a coin called dgen it's like this what I thought was a stupid little dgen coin the DJ they then launched their own layer three built on built on arbitrum which is a layer two on top of ethereum scaling solution and that the dgen chain L3 is doing the most transactions per second in the entire ethereum ecosystem today so that is like I think that's what we'll there will be some successful companies built on the back of these meme coins most of them will end in teers many tiar many many many many tiers I mean same with nfts right like a lot of the those ended in tiers and there's some cool ones I also think the last are of meme coins that are interesting are spec are speculation on events so people have tried to build in crypto and not in crypto prediction markets for a long time right there's all these like betting on the election sites there's Ki I think which is like a squ or Andre back company there's poly market and none of these have really taken off too much and if you look at what's happening with there's a token called Bowden and there's talk called Bowden and Biden and these actually have massive volumes and move directly in correlation with how people think the presidential election is going so when Biden did his big speech a couple this probably a month ago and people liked it the Bowden which is like inverse Biden coin went went down and then Biden really screwed something up the Bowden coin went up Trump has a good speech Bowen coin goes higher so I do think that these like meme coins as a form of speculation will mostly end in tears but they're also going to be a really interesting way for like the world to gamble on different events and like like it or hate it I kind of hate it but the world is moving towards like a full gambling Society right I'm watching the NFL and like the announcers are literally talking about their parlays like on NBA app and like there's gambling embedded inside of the app so yeah like it or hate it it's I mean I think that's where the world is going I agree with you I agree with you I think uh it's the financialization of everything that's like the the nice way of putting it the not so nice way of putting it is the world's turning into a casino and you'll be able to bet on everything but I will say you got me thinking about if these coins are just ways to acquire audience and then you now have this audience and then you can build products for them that that you know and you could put blinders on and just focus on building products that that Community is going to they're not even a community I'm not going to call them a community that group of people want to buy or use then you you might have a really big opportunity there I mean there's a lot that will end in tear but don't think about them as a think about them as just another growth hack to get users I talked to a um company earlier this week that's doing 500k a day in Revenue they have 40,000 users they launched a couple months ago and they built on the back of this like meme coin community and they have no desire to be in the meme coin game they're just they but they got 40,000 users and they're doing 500k a day on Revenue because they leaned to meme coins and then they're going to Pivot and basically launch up something else in crypto on the back of these 40,000 users very cool and that's why I invited you on I invited you on because I I like how you think how you think where uh uh I know you have a podcast tell tell us where people can listen to your podcast for more of you yeah podcast is called Empire so what we did the reason we launched it is a lot of the podcasts were not a lot of the crypto podcasts were either people like Shilling some random coin that they had a big bag of or they were just I think they didn't really understand what was going on in the industry and just because we like we from been been in the industry for almost seven years fulltime now and running block works like we have a very like Insider look into the industry and what's happening behind the scenes and how the deal the Venture raises are getting structured and all this kind of stuff and so we launched a podcast called Empire it's been around for almost three years and yeah my co-host Santiago and I basically just give you like the inside baseball of what's happening in crypto so I love it and block Works research yeah if you're an allocator or fund that invests in crypto and we basically built the the must subscribe to platform it's $4,500 a year it's about 400 bucks a month actually I guess it's a little less than that 350 whatever it is and and uh yeah I'd recommend it so DM me on I'm also on Twitter Jason yanowitz and you can DM me if you want to check out the platform or go listen to the Pod whatever your boat thanks uh thanks for coming on my man thanks for sipping with me wait what did you end up sipping were you sipping anything dude I had I had all three man you were you were taking me for a ride there at one point I need some coffee I've got the lroy now that you eased up on me so we're we're good all right I love it all right take care man

so one of the things I really love to do is launching stuff like taking something that's pretty boring so our latest thing if you go to ajs smart.com we just launched a in-person facilitation training essentially for mainly for corporate employees and we repackaged it in a way that no one else in the industry is doing it at a price that's three to four times more than anyone else is charging that's the kind of stuff I really love to do I I love to take boring elements pull them together and repackage them and then sell them with me as the CEO we would probably max out a 10 million on a business like that I can't believe we're doing this yeah it's PR cool I'm very very excited about it you know you messaged me about coming onto the Pod and you were just like hey I've got this other friend who's this big-time YouTuber and he should be on the Pod but also like I would be on the Pod too and I was like whoaa that person who you mentioned by the way I've already spoken to about coming on the pod and I would much rather you on the Pod than him well I much appreciate that Greg I appreciate it I just didn't want to like be presumptuous messaging you like hey uh just let me on your podcast you know just I'm so cool just let me on your podcast because I met you once because we got drunk together you know now you have to let me on your podcast that's the rule you know the rule about startup ideas podcast have a coup and then we're bonded you come on the Pod deep bonding happened deep bond deep bonding yes absolutely um you are the internet's best kept secret as far as I'm concerned oh no well no one's ever said that to me in a good way I mean a lot of people know about you and you you create a lot of content and you're you're you're known as the quote unquote unscheduled CEO in some circles yeah in some circles yeah I think the unscheduled CEO is like my my little that's my secret thing that's my dirty dirty secret little podcast going on in the background uh most me most people know me because of just nonstop Instagram ads so I think if you think about the the majority of people who know about me they're already annoyed just because of the amount of Instagram ads that they see with my face on it exactly but it it's it's worked and that's kind of why I wanted you to have why I wanted to have you on it's just because I I do think you have a ton of good ideas for Better or For Worse for the internet but I'm excited to talk more about it yeah me too I even brought a few uh weird little ideas to talk about as well weird I know I know you like guest to bring startup ideas and so I brought a couple of ideas I brought a couple of things that I think you're going to like your audience will find valuable of course you had to call it weird ideas so it's very well some of them are sexual okay okay all right maybe I don't know if you're going to put this on the I listened to your last episode with Noah Kagan you talked about this podcast you went on where you recorded an episode and then they did not air it I think this is going to be what happens to me for this podcast that's possible that's possible that was the 20 VC podcast yeah which I I didn't I wasn't it didn't air so what a shame I'm going to air this I'm going to air this we're going to we're we're we're we want unfiltered unscheduled CEO Jonathan Courtney you know two two names two first names one name great guy let's go what do you got what's idea number one oh you want me to actually go into the the startup ideas straight away okay yeah all right yeah because I do all right that's how we do it in America you know in America it's stra to business let's just make some money immediately okay here's my first idea so I mean first of all just maybe a tiny bit of clarification for people I am not a startup founder I'm a business owner a small business owner right I don't uh I don't do VC stuff I'm I actually do invest in other people's companies but my own business that makes me money um is essentially a small business you know we sell uh we're mixture of an agency info products and all of that kind of stuff but we work with a [ __ ] ton of startups and I'm always excited excited to when I see an idea that just excites me or a an industry where I can see that something should be happening but because I don't start startups I'm always frustrated so here are some ideas that I want your audience to bring into the world I want them to make themselves billionaires and I'll be an investor right in these ideas okay so Greg I'm very sensitive to noise here's my first idea for you very sensitive to noise but I like living in cities I also have like tinitus meaning my ears are ringing when it's too quiet I don't like I don't like when it's too quiet but I also don't like noise right so what do you do what do you do when your ears are ringing but you don't like noise but you want to live in a city uh especially for me one thing that irritates me living in a like a kind of building with lots of other people is Neighbors walking around uh so even though I have a nice insulated apartment there's just there's always something that's going to wake me up now I'm someone who invests a lot in my sleep so I have an eight sleep you know mattress cover that keeps me cool all night that thing's amazing um I take sleep supplements uh all that kind of [ __ ] I wear my like you know blue blocking glasses but the thing that has improved my sleep more than anything else this is not a sales pitch this is an idea for to start off I'm so used to pitching stuff that I'm in sales pitch mode the thing that has improved my sleep the most is a essentially Brown noise just this noise coming out of my Sono speaker and I figured this out by buying different Brown noise and white noise machines so the first thing I did is I went to like wire cutter if you don't use wire cutter for getting your products you're an idiot it's just a product review site and on wire cutter they have this product called the elran Evo I bought that it was good but it wasn't loud enough and it wasn't Bassy enough so then I started looking around the internet and I ended up finding this like white noise and sleep sounds podcast on Spotify and I found the perfect noise for sleeping which is called Deep Brown noise now I'm going to get to the first startup idea right so the first startup idea and if you look by the way the bestselling white noise machine in the [ __ ] world if you go to go to this website for me so search elran and then go to soundof sleep.com now I get very excited when I see a not very sexy website and not very sexy marketing for a product that's super useful and this is this would be my first startup idea it would be disrupting basically creating the eight sleep for brown noise and creating a device that is so it's AI powered of course it figures out when you know when it hears your neighbors walking it adds more base to the noise it turns on automatically at the right time when you're going to bed it gets a little bit more Qui it can connect to your whoop and it can tell when you're in deep sleep so it can be a little bit quieter it can be a bit louder when you're in phases where it doesn't want you to when you would be more susceptible to waking up and I think honestly just building a re I would even honestly think buying elran buying their product and reselling it with better marketing would be a pretty huge business not a multi-billion doll business I'm not a billion guy I'm not a billion guy right the most one of our products has ever made we're just doing the like calculations of it is like18 to20 million so I don't I can't lie and tell you I know how to make a billion dollar startup but I think taking this general idea of how unbelievably noticeably powerful Brown noise is for sleep like the eight Sleep mattress you can kind of kind of tell it's working I don't know maybe but you also pay this crazy subscription but I think a company could come along and make a connected subscription based noise device that you can also there's going to be like a baby version of it to bring around with you to hotels um and this actually really improves my sleep first idea what do you think you buying it are you investing well yes and yes so I'm like a sleep nerd too this is my sleep score from last night on my e sleep 95 check this out I I D I didn't sleep well last night wait for it two nights ago all right let me show you two nights ago first we got a 97 who you see that wait we can oh there we go yeah oh man wow last night last night because I had a late call oh 88 although I will say you didn't wake up that much is it because of the brown it is so there's something deep and brown in my room clarification question cuz to me I don't know what brown noise is ready to me Brown noise just sounds like I'm gonna get pink eye it's not coming out of a body it's not coming out of a specific part of the body all right right now go to Spotify type in white noise and sleep sounds the playlist is actually a podcast called add free white noise and sleep sounds 12 hours M then you want to go to the podcast which is called Deep Brown noise and Skip to about 20 seconds because you actually have to pay to listen to it without an ad at the start which you do not want to happen in the middle of the night which has happened to me following the shortage so yeah this guy exactly this guy I hear him every night this is the noise of deep Brown noise it sounds like being in a plane [Music] could you sleep on planes by the way um I mean not unless it's business class right no I asked cuz like you know I can't sleep on planes so to me I'm like is brown noise going to work for me how do I know if Brown noise going to work for me I guess I just need to try it do things wake you up at night noises yes all the time Brown noises deep Brown noise is going to work for you so things that wake me up dogs barking Sirens Neighbors walking around very violent farts coming from different parts of my apartment including me just anything that makes a noise will be the cool thing about deep Brown noise is that it has the base so white noise is 2022 [ __ ] right people are talking about white noise all the time that covers like the high kind of levels of I don't know people going like birds and [ __ ] deep and brown noise is cool but that's like 2023 [ __ ] deep Brown noise is 2024 level so it it gets the Bassy stuff as well I live in Berlin everyone listens to techno 247 and I still but I still want to live where stuff is happening I also still want to sleep with my windows open to get that nice oxygen all that kind of stuff deep Brown noise has changed my life and if someone listening to this is like why don't you just wear earplugs because I'm not a psychopath exactly might drop because he's not a psychop I don't want someone to break into my apartment and murder me without me even realizing I mean the brown noise will cover it up until moment that the knife is about to enter my brain but with the earplugs it would be in me already and I wouldn't even realize it I mean if I was breaking into someone's apartment in Berlin and all of a sudden I hear Brown noise from a machine like this deep Brown noise I'm like uh oh I got to run out of here this guy crazy bad happening in here he's got like a little plane engine um but it's honestly been I'm all jokes aside this has increased my sleep score on the E sleep more than any supplement more than any [ __ ] blue blocking glasses more than fasting more than putting Brian Johnson's olive oil up my ass like any of these things have improved a little bit they can they can improve my deep sleep maybe a tiny bit my RM a tiny bit the brown noise when I switch it off it's like I go down to 85 when it's on I'm up to like 95 and I have a kid and sometimes there's non if you have a child guys there's non like that's another I do not want to wear earplugs when I have a kid in case she needs me but I don't need to hear every cough and every like little you know whatever and so the brown noise it does this thing of keeping you aware you can hear things if they're important but is sleep and covering especially neighbor foot this honestly if we just end the podcast right now this will be the most valuable thing and guess I'm just kidding but but this will actually help a couple of people who are very sensitive and so I think this this this startup could then expand to light sensitive light sensitivity as well because I'm you know everyone is like hyper sensitive and everyone hears everything and sees everything it's like e and actually I'm unfortunately one of these people where I get a migraine if it's too bright and if it's too loud I get overwhelmed um and just a startup and I the research that I was doing trying to figure this out was really most of my time was spent on Reddit right and it was just constant self-experimentation I was thinking there should just be a sweet ass brand eight sleep hire me as your head of sensitive sleep stuff and also by the way the eight sleep dude is your pod sometimes just really loud for no reason yeah 100% it just act up act up like last night it was just like I you know I'm spending like I don't know thousands of dollars on this thing and then SP spending subscription service and it's just screaming at me and you honestly if you use an eight sleep you need to use deep Brown noise to cover the variation in noises from the bed I know this is I'm assuming your podcast is not I'm assuming the people who listen to your podcast aren't going to be like uh first world problems it's a what startup ideas but yeah obviously obviously I know this is a first world problem Oh my eight sleep is too loud yeah oh no the Techno from the best club in the world is playing yeah well so that's my first idea I like it so tact you know if we're going to get tactical sound of sleep I'm on their website um this product looks great um I go to their affiliate program I'm like okay maybe the way to like bootstrap this is you just become an affiliate to them they give you 30% or whatever and then you validate it and then build your own then I go to their affiliate program our affiliate program has ended we are no longer accepting new Affiliates dude I would I wouldn't if I'm making this into a business I'm I'm I'm probably doing it a bit more MVP style I'm making my own Brown noise track so my own deep Brown noise audio track so one of the things I really love to do is launching stuff like it's taking something that's pretty boring so our our latest thing if you go to ajs smart.com this is not an ad it's sold out you cannot get it and we're not doing it again but as an example we just launched something which could not be more boring on a facilit in-person facilitation training essentially for mainly for corporate employees and we repackaged it in a way that no one else in the industry is doing it uh completely like at a at a price that's three to four times more than anyone else is charging that's the kind of stuff I really love to do I I love to take boring elements pull them together and repackage them and then sell them but obviously I want to believe in the things as well with this deep noise thing I think that the way the company white noise and sleep sounds is doing it is closer to the way I would want to play it out and so I would probably rather sell the subscription to initially to different Brown noise things the way they're doing it but the best case scenario would be if I could validate this I'd probably want to make like work with some manufacturers to create this product but I don't do that [ __ ] man you know so it's all yours I know but here's the thing so I went to San Francisco recently and I I met like a bunch of the cool kids um at this place called Founders Inc it's like a lot of young a lot of young people building startups and a lot of them are actually Mark Zuckerberg for example you mean like like Mark if Mark Zuckerberg was you know 20 years ago he would he would he would have gone to this this really cool uh this really cool space called Founders Inc and a lot of the people there are building um like Little Hardware devices that they're 3D printing that's so cool and then injecting Ai and voice into it so I wonder if this isn't that hard to actually MVP dude look here's what I'm good at I'm good at having those ideas I'm good at marketing them and making money from them and selling them and doing internet marketing and making a physical thing that's something I'm not going to be if you want me to pretend for the podcast I am going to build this no but I I'm probably not going to build it realistically but I'd love if someone would do that and I would definitely invest 10 EUR oh sorry $12 oh okay now I understand um so I had uh I had Kevin rose on the Pod last week and I asked him what kind of he he had this like incredi looking microphone like it make made our microphones look like it was Amateur hour the lights around it here I think so yeah and it's just like this it's a it's a gray it looks like a stainless steel block it almost looks I'm looking at an Apple Studio display it kind of looks like an Apple Studio display I just got one of those today literally just arrived this morning that's such a I mean it's not a weird thing that you say that but look I don't think anyone's going to care about this part but this just arrived at my apartment today oh Apple Studio that's cool that's the whole that's the whole piece of information okay let's go that's the whole bit let's go back to Kevin Rose yeah back to Kevin Rose away from Noah Kagan Kevin Rose and then me oh man exact oh yeah such a downgrade and people are gonna love this episode more than any episode so he has this thing called the the the the company's called teenage engineering dude are you [ __ ] serious wait a second let's go back to this picture let's go back to this picture let's zoom in now this makes sense what's on my desk all teenag engineering products yeah are you talking about this microphone yeah that's exactly what I'm talking about what the [ __ ] teenage engineering so teenage engineering is like I think they're in Europe somewhere Am I Wrong Sweden Sweden which is like makes sense they're in Sweden so theyve got these beautifully designed products uh like synthesizers wireless speakers um all their stuff is sold out and all of it is thousands of dollarss um and all of it like if you go to teenageengineering all of it makes your mouth water I have every single one of their products and they're one of my favorite companies in the world so if you like I can imagine your deep Brown noise machine to be like yes teenage engineering style yes deep Brown teenage engineering TJ teenage engineering if you're listening to this and you want to make a deep Brown noise machine with me I'm very close to your office I'm here in Berlin I'm coming to Denmark this weekend even though this podcast is never going to come out I'm talking to you right now let's do this together no I think the move is you don't do it together with them like we do it we compete we we're competitive guys know [ __ ] teenage engineering [ __ ] you guys yeah adult engineering adult adult engineering that's us me and Greg yeah exactly and what you what you do is you build this MVP you hire someone in Sweden to design it you Swedish yeah exactly got it they have to be Swedish so you know designed in designed in Sweden and so we can say that and then we put up a landing page a framer a framer uh frer funnels click uh I don't know we can I would do framer just because it's more beautiful but you would do clickfunnels probably better clickfunnels it's it's so we got to talk about clickfunnels in a while your audience your audience needs to hear more about clickfunnels we'll get we'll get to clickfunnels we won't leave this conversation without talking about clickfunnels again as that sound I'm still with you your audience is going to be so annoyed at the amount of interruptions that are happening here but um and uh you put up a landing page you you you you know you get some creators to back it and you pre- order it you know you do pre-sale and then you figure it out from there yeah dude I would do it I love the Sleep space um yeah and this is the only one you can actually measure honestly if you wear an aura ring or a whoop and if you are sound sensitive this is just a huge topic that people haven't been tackling but it really changed my entire life the other thing that I always thought Apple would build but never built which has also changed my life in Miami is an air purifier right I haven't gotten in on that game yet so there's just a ton of dust and allergens in the air and having you know not that I'm like allergic to a lot of things or but whatever I have people over they might be sick this removes it I have like I open the door on my balcony and there's like pollen and like mold from the outside that comes in it just keeps like a fresh air I always thought Apple would potentially build like an air purifier um they never did but I I like the idea of like starting with a deep Brown noise machine and then likeing your way up yeah working your way up working your way out but I think like uh you know we call this company sensitivity um a sensitivity Ai and um billions yeah that's it or elran if you're listening to this I'm sure elran the guys at elran probably listen to this podcast every week uh call up me and Greg what we'll do for you guys is we'll take that product off your hands and we'll resell it under a new brand called adult engineer adult engineering yeah and you know with teenage engineering you always have to have a cryptic name like the tp7 so we'll call it the adult engineering dn2 deep deep Brown oh no DB deep Brown n dbn perfect I need to go I need go it's been a long day for me on this end dude I'm at the end of like campaign meetings like it's my eyes are so red look at me they're great you look so fresh and I look red you're firing at all cylinders what's idea number two that was idea no no I'm kidding let's see I dude I I put a lot of them together here um will we do a naughty one let's do it how naughty can we get on your podcast I mean it's the internet you know you've seen the Internet it's a pretty naughty place I don't know dude you know some people's podcasts are a little bit more like we got to be we got to be careful with what we say there's no advertisers good okay yeah you know the way and this is something that I'm sure people have been thinking about so the other day I was on the verge yesterday the verge.com they were they were showing off this product called orifice doai if you haven't checked out orifice doai it's the world's first AI powered sex toy for men and I was looking at this and I was thinking why do women get all of like the nice cute like just APPL like branding around sex toys and guys get the flashlight and orifice AI I genuinely think there's an entire Market out there for sex I don't know what pleasure self-pleasure devices for men that is like as big a as big a thing as it is for women but just not creepy and not weird and not like some dirty [ __ ] that you have to like I don't know just like the flashlight you know what I mean it doesn't you don't want to have that lying around if someone walks into your apartment you know not that you want to have other sex toys laying around when you walk into an apartment but still there's something deeply not cool or or like uh sophisticated that's the word I'm looking for like if you look for there's a lot of like uh brands in and I don't know if this brand is in Germany or in in the US but in Germany there's this brand of sex toys called fun and like there's a whole store it looks like an Apple store it's mainly toys for women this just could be the biology thing where maybe you can just make more of a variety of toys for women but I think we got to make like the Apple more sophisticated kind of self-pleasure toy business for men that isn't called orifice or Fleshlight and is rather called something like adult engineering it's also the next adult engineering product because that can also help you sleep Greg if you know what I mean that's right so I agree with you the naming is absurd I mean you invite a friend over to come have some tea or something just like my orifice no it's oh oh oh you just dropped oh you just stepped on my orifice be careful I say that even if I have no sex toys lying around yeah so that's a bit weird and so I think you know the Cannabis industry actually did a really good job of right of taking something that was like pretty like it was for Stoners and stuff like that and then in La there was this company called men which basically created like the Apple for Cannabis stores yes that's what I mean exactly like because it is really I I I wrote this as a joke you said I can say whatever I want and I was careful because again you know I do a lot of work in the US a lot of work with us companies a lot of uh work with EU companies in EU in Europe I can say anything I want in a meeting no one cares if I swear in the US I was recently in New York and and dropped the f bomb in front of like 57 people working in a large bank and I got a like and I was like oh sorry sorry about that just G to tone that back but I did have a joke name for so what I wrote here is is there a way to make masturbation toys for men less creepy a Cool brand like liquid death but for male sex toys not called 5000 for example yeah exactly we shouldn't call that no that should be the name of this episode just so out of context 5,000 yeah watch this episode to the end all right all right I'll give you another one um I dude I have a lot you I I I woke up this morning I got your message saying three to five ideas and myself and my girlfriend just sat down and we just pumped out a couple of ideas okay let's stay on the sex Concept in Berlin right we're we're in Berlin I don't know if know much about Berlin but it's a very sex positive environment which I'm which I'm which I think is great um I think though what I will say is that a lot of the sex positive stuff I don't know if anyone knows about this sex positive idea it's just the idea that like in Berlin there's a lot of clubs where you can go and you know I don't know dude I don't know how far I can go on this podcast I me do people know generally the Berlin thing like people kind of know that but all right okay let's say you're a couple and you're interested in like I'm just I'm interested in exploring kind of what's out there you know and we're not talking about like going as far as swinging or whatever you start looking at Retreats like sex positive Retreats like maybe you learn Tantra whatever I feel like there's a missing part of the market for people who are not interested in the spiritual stuff who are not interested in the Psychedelic side of things and who just kind of want to go and have a more yeah just just a non non-spiritual non psychedelic sex positive Retreats and what I have written separately is I think there's also a part in the market completely separately for entrepreneurial like unplugged Retreats that are again non-spiritual no yoga No meditation no whm Hof none of those things I think there's like sometimes these interesting ideas are mixed with things that are a big turnoff if you're not into spiritual kind of more psychedelic things so that that's another I feel like there's a place in the market for looking at things which are usually mixed with psychedelics uh and usually mixed with meditation or yoga and removing those elements and making it more practical look at that weird thumbs up thing just appeared it's so weird when that does that um I think uh no uh I think uh I like the idea so a buddy of mine has an app that he's beta testing right now in New York and Miami called beyond beyond beyond uh oh yeah it's a NAU app so the idea is basically it's an app for open-minded people basically the idea is have you heard of the field app no I haven't so field app is like a popular it's kind of like Tinder but for mult multiple people for like couples looking for other couples I have another idea on that my coming up for you but yeah no I haven't heard of it but I'm going to check it out yeah so that app is apparently like really is getting really popular but it feels very like Tinder in the sense that it feels from a UI ux perspective like if Tinder is like the Walmart of the internet R is like you know a boutique it doesn't it feels very you know so he was like how do I create the Rya but for uh open-minded people and it's really starting to take off that is very interesting the way he's scaling it is through these parties I shouldn't call them parties Retreats like you what you what you were saying so he's doing one soon in El uh Els salador where he's like renting a big place he's inviting a bunch of people the community he's curating it um and it's like more along the lines of what you're talking about um and it's starting to work for me it's like a framework for like these Retreats are actually a really good way for user acquisition and like getting really be stoked about what you're doing I'm not personally saying that this is something that I interested in right now at this point in my life but I think it's something where I'm just exposed to it a lot in Berlin and I just see I just do see a gap for it there's like a definitely a space in the market for the non kind of of spiritual version of that or like the non don't know whatever that would be all right let's go let's go nonsexual for a second all right and actually no I've got a really bad sexual no um okay do you know the app brick and the product brick you use it I have one right here yeah I do use it okay so brick I think it's an amazing product I use it every day let's see what my current streak is my current streak let's take a look let's get it 39 hour is it uh 319 hours is my current streak why is my phone so wet looking um so brick is basically a physical product which you can use to lock certain apps on your phone and when you lock these certain apps on your phone uh you have this physical product imagine it looks like this and then it it's also magnetic you can like stick it somewhere in your kitchen and you cannot get access to those product there you go you cannot get access to those apps again until you physically use the brick to touch off your phone again now I think that's a cool idea because I think there's a lot of problems forming and I don't think it's going to get any better anytime soon when it comes to phone addiction I think people don't don't also don't realize they don't realize they're addicted to their devices yet I think it hasn't really been defined people kind of understand what it looks like to be addicted to things like alcohol or drugs but I don't think there's a clear understanding yet of what it looks like to be addicted to your physical your digital device and I think there's a huge space in the market for a company to come along and be essentially the digital you know like the the product zero for fasting something like zero but paired with something like brick so not only can you get a lot of Education on maybe potentially the dangers of using digital devices all the time but you can explain what zero is to people for for people who don't know what it is zero is a fasting app it helps you to fast uh do different types of fasts um and track those fasts but it's also got a lot of educational content from people like Peter AA Dr Peter Dr Peter AA um and so it builds the education around why you should why fasting is valuable but it also tracks your fasts and it also kind of builds streaks and and gives you a lot of uh feedback so I think it's it's a great product for just keeping track and actually Kevin also created a product called zero alcohol which is a product Kevin and Mike uh worked on this product called zero alcohol and this is a product that does something similar but for alcohol and I think there's a huge gap in the market for people first of all a lot of what a lot of what I like to do is pres uh show people that they actually do have an issue a lot of marketing is like hey you do you realize that this is actually a problem uh and then showing people how they can work with it and I think that brick is probably one of the first products that's actually helped me reduce my time on my phone and honestly I I just see also having a daughter now I really want there to be some infrastructure for people dealing with digital addiction but brick is just literally a utility and I think it could be turned into a brand a product uh educ Media company around digital addiction um so it could do something good but also I do think that's something that people would pay for especially entrepreneurs like me who are on our phones all day just having something like that where I'm like no matter what I do I always just keep checking my phone I'm just addicted I just want to see what's on Twitter and so I need something that literally physically blocks Safari so that when I'm sitting on my couch and I open my phone or I'm sitting on the toilet and I open my phone I would literally have to walk into the living room pants down to get that block to unblock Safari so that I can look at it which I would have no problem doing but still you know what I mean right it's just this extra layer of friction that stops you from using your digital product and so the idea would be a bigger you see you see the pattern here I'm looking at boring stuff and thinking about how to make a bigger brand making content like like a Content strategy around it because that's what I do so how would you okay so say you were say you bought brick what I would do to make it a bigger company yeah all right you ready Greg oh I'm I would just use my own Playbook I mean it's not it's again just to clarify I am not someone who grows businesses to billion like I don't know how to do that I don't know how to do the VC thing that Kevin does where you just make these crazy huge companies I know I've never hired I've never had more than 36 people working at this at at AJ and smart um and I've never made I've never had a product that has made more than 20 million I think it's $18 million just just so when you're listening to my playbook this is me thinking from a pure maybe 37 signals kind of no VC bootstrap just it's about making money uh but that might not be the big type of business that some people listen to this podcast would want to have but okay I buy brick and my goal is to make lots of money with it as much money as possible and spread awareness about it the first thing I would probably do maybe in in week one is I'd probably start a YouTube channel uh that YouTube channel would be 100% focused on grabbing all the keywords around uh digital addiction uh phone addiction um any I would just do the keyword research and and the easy way to do that by the way if you just want to be really uh very lowii is go to YouTube and start slowly typing in the thing like so for example I would write phone I would write first phone addiction and I would I would just press enter and I would remake the top three videos better than the ones that are there already then I would click into the first video and I would remake the first recommended video so the start of me creating a YouTube channel or the start of when we move into a new topic at AJ and smart is essentially REM making all of the most popular videos and I don't know if you know this trick I can't remember who I learned it from if you find a video that has a lot of views but very few subscribers that's something that YouTube really likes and so you you want to remake that video essentially so I would start uh one stream would be having a YouTube channel to build some sort of content awareness and it would be purely SEO focused so I'm not trying to build a like a YouTube channel like Mr Beast where people are super engaged I'm doing what we've done with a SM where people are searching for keywords and finding us on YouTube that YouTube video would probably link to a free mini course or could be literally a small ebook or it could be a free community I mean we both use school.com um it would just be a place to ner collect and nurture leads for a while so I would I would just be creating content collecting and nurturing leads on this topic of digital um digital addiction etc etc the product itself wouldn't be super to be honest like I'd rather do this without having to buy this brick product like the logistics behind that wouldn't be very interesting to me personally I think I would make I think one would make a lot more money doing this without taking on a physical product um what I would do is I would build essentially a media and cont business an info product business around digital addiction um I would write the book on the topic but I wouldn't launch it with a publisher I would launch it the way that a direct response marketers launch their books and which is the way we launched our previous book uh I would use I would create a bookfunnel a bookfunnel is just like essentially your your ping you're you're losing money on every book because you're giving it away for free a physical copy of the book and you're getting but you're bringing people through like a a lead collection funnel and potentially upselling them to something like a course or something like that um I'm always thinking in the way the things that work for me is selling info products so I would probably sell training in-person training uh I would I would very likely try to get corporates to book me and my team to do large scale digital awareness training for their employees and I think you if with me as the CEO we would probably max out a 10 million on a product on a business like that that's my problem is that I I'm not as ambitious as like a lot of American CEOs where they're like I'm going to take over the world with this thing I'm like that's that's fine that's enough well a lot of people are coming to that realization now that especially people listening to this that like that VC uh treadmill is is definitely treadmill and so a lot of people are it's becoming now popular to do what you've been doing for a while and what I've started to do over the last few years yeah dude you're you're also doing that a lot I see with the school group um I see you with the boring SEO company um these are just it's just so much more enjoyable to look at the p&l every month and just be able to see this how much money we make this how much money we spent and now we can optimize based on those things this is how much our ads cost this is how much it this is how many people bought our thing um yeah just selling services or info products and uh masterminds or any sort of Education thingies I also I masterminds masterminds like here's my take on masterminds is like I've had really productive Mass what people would call Mastermind sessions with Sean pory for example from my first million used to have this like Mastermind type type thing that he used to do and it was super productive um so I've had I've had uh instances of that but these like pay for a mastermind type experiences that I see a lot of people do like to me would feel weird like I don't think I would launch a mastermind personally because I would be like I'm not going to charge you Jonathan $30,000 a year to like hang out with me I disagree with you um I agree with you that I don't personally want to run a mastermind and charge people for it and i' I've kind of tried different things on that on on that general idea and I've never personally enjoyed running them or even every time I've just every time I'm just about to start running one of these things I quit I will say that I am currently in a mastermind that's been ludicrously helpful and previously I was in Sam oven's Mastermind for 3 years and Sam ovens maybe with within maybe within the first or second day of being in the Mastermind changed literally like I joined in like let's say on a Tuesday the following Tuesday I completely rethought everything about AJ and smart and the product we created in Sam oven's Mastermind with Sam's help is our still our core product four years later still the thing that makes us our most money and what I will say is I like so when you have some I I think you've met Sam when you have someone who's very special and who has like done the thing you want to do I actually prefer to be able to pay them for their advice rather than trying to figure out how I can deliver value as well uh if it's possible so if someone has a way for me to pay them just to get the [ __ ] advice I will I would rather pay them Sam's Mastermind was $36,000 per year just just like the connections I made the Val the information I got from Sam the energy of being in that group was always worth a lot more than 36k per year and the other thing I will say is almost everyone who's been who who was in that Mastermind is still like really good friends with Sam so I would disagree with you on that one the current Mastermind I'm in is actually one of the members of the ma of Sam oven Mastermind a guy called Blake lrange and the product we just launched the full stack facilitator we wanted to launch this for 3,000 or 4,000 or something like that one 30 minute conversation with him where we talked about repositioning it uh increased the price to $9,000 and it sold out so we like just the amount of money we wouldn't have made if I hadn't had that conversation with him but I do understand why you wouldn't want to do that or why I wouldn't want to run it I just I would just find it annoying um but I personally am very happy that masterminds exist for my own own sake so first of all you've changed my mind on on things before so literally like the first minute I met you you're like hi I'm Jonathan and then I was like oh I got to record a bunch of videos for or what what was I saying no I was like oh I have a cohort-based course I'm doing next week oh cohort based courses and exactly what you said you're like Coates courses what are you crazy and and then you changed my mind on it and ever since then I I I never I stopped doing that coort after meeting you I don't do coort based courses anymore yeah glad you don't yeah and it's been great because it allows me to run my businesses um it's just so much energy to run a coort based course yes what I but I did do is record a bunch of my Frameworks and playbooks put it on school community empire.co and that's going really well and then I I show up to some amas uh here and there and that way I actually get to know people because in the coer based course model I was just kind of like I felt like I was regurgitating all my stuff it sucks so like felt like a waste of time anyways you changed my mind on one thing The Mastermind thing I I totally understand like okay the right Mastermind could be impactful the wrong Mastermind could be crap um is basically what you know is basically the idea I think I've never been in a bad Mastermind so I I think it also depends what type of person you are I think I would imagine you are the type of person who can take the best out of almost any interaction for me I'm like I'm looking at every mentor and every Mastermind or everything every course I join is just like a giant blob and I'm looking for the tiny bits that are useful for me um I don't care about like Sam oven's Mastermind I was in it for three years I never once turned up to the in-person events in La never once I never turned up to I almost turned up to nothing never saw me my way of using things is like I turn up I ask one question and then six months later I turn up and say this was the result of that question and now I have something I'd like to ask and that's worth 36k for me because it saves me 36k worth of time working on what I do what I will say is masterminds are not the $36,000 Mastermind is not useful for someone who doesn't know how to take action but you're you're not like for example I think a mastermind that would be good for you this will be controversial this is back to clickfunnels if you're if you're selling info products I think there is like one Mastermind which actually I am not joining right now because the price is so high plus I don't live in the US plus all the events are in the US but if I lived in the US I would join this in a heartbeat and it's it's not someone some it's not a guy that people like in maybe who listen to your podcast it's more likely someone people don't like but I'm bringing a weird angle it's Russell brunson's uh top level Mastermind called Atlas only 15 people are in it um I don't think there's a better again we're talking about the info product space we're talking about marketing we're talking about direct response marketing and copyrighting we're not talking about VC nice looking landing pages and and like fancy looking products we're talking about stuff very much just like money making uh I I think that s um not sens I think Russell brunson's Atlas Mastermind is probably insanely valuable while it exists that's the other thing I think about when I was thinking about joining Sam oven's Mastermind I was like this guy is going to once these people get rich enough they just of course don't do masterminds anymore because they're just chilling like Russell Brunson you who knows you maybe have two more years worth of getting access to something like this for I think it's 100 250k per year I think um which might seem like a lot but you obviously would only join if you knew that the advice could make you more than that um I would join it if I lived in the US um just My just My Vibes so I don't know much about Russell Brenson besides kind of like you seeing his ads in my face for so many years and he seems scammy and he's got that kind of like energy that most people in our world doesn't don't like so talk to me why is R Russell Brunson someone you look up to and why is clickfunnel something that people like me should take seriously all right I didn't think I'd be doing a sales pitch for Russell Brunson here um okay I'll tell you that so as as AJ and smart we were we were normal design agency up until 2016 we were selling in-person training we were doing a lot of content marketing based on like Gary ve um we even went to this like in-person Mastermind with Gary ve where there was just 12 people and it was great we we have a YouTube video on that actually of doing this Mastermind with him and so we were all in on this Gary ve method which is kind of like creating [ __ ] tons of content building up your brand and then that almost automatically leads to sales and ET Etc but then I was introduced to this book called expert secrets in 2016 and this is when I was trying to when I was thinking about this idea of digitizing the in-person training we were doing and the idea was actually just to digitize it for our clients uh because they were asking for videos of the in-person training I read the book expert secrets and it completely blew my mind like I read it and I didn't know anything about this Russell Brunson guy and I was like holy crap like I've never heard of a webinar I don't know what this one to many marketing is I don't know what direct response marketing is but then I realized I actually had been exposed to it for a very long time you know Noah Kagan who was on your podcast recently uh one of his best friends a guy called Neville madora maybe you know him or know of him he's the first person who introduced me to copywriting and all of this world is connected it's direct response it's called direct response marketing so direct response marketing as I understand it is marketing where you can literally measure every every cent you spend so like for every ad you put out there you can measure this is exactly how much money is coming back because of this ad and it's a lot about it's it's not about building a brand it's about actually getting a direct response from what you're putting out there and this really appealed to me uh versus just this broad branding approach uh which I couldn't really tell whether it was working or not and so we ran a webinar using this the structure in the book expert secrets in 2016 and we didn't have the course yet we were saying we had it because we were we were we basically said if we make more than €10,000 Euro we're going to make the course I did the webinar so first of all I created a Facebook group we ran ads to fill up the Facebook Facebook group it was called Innovation hackers it's still there but it's it's dead um and then I ran a webinar to the people in that group who didn't know me and we made $50,000 and I was like what the [ __ ] is this like they've prepaid for a course that we haven't even made yet um and by the way like if you know what it's like to work with clients a $50,000 project is is quite can be quite a lot of calls and back and forth and we were a design product design studio and I was like $50,000 and I've done a one and a half hour webinar okay so we made the product and then I said Laura who I now basically run the whole company with she she runs all of the digital course stuff I said to her if we can make 50k a month uh then I will build a team for this uh and it was like it made it made like over a million Revenue in the first year but the crazy thing is we were just using one marketing tactic and that was a webinar just the same webinar on repeat pre-recorded uh just playing just people could just unlock it um and this just completely blew my mind and so I think a year later my team and I decided to go so we read the book we signed up for the guy's newsletter and he has this conference in the US called funnel hacking live like I rolled my eyes and cringed the first time I saw the landing page for that in the video I was like oh [ __ ] this [ __ ] like it's so American uh Tony Robins all this crap I'm not interested um but I don't know somehow we decided to go because we were going to pick for as a nice thing for the team we were going to pick up I don't know if you've ever seen like in the background of a lot of marketing videos you see these funnel or these like awards that look like discs I don't know we were going to pick up one of those it's if if if your funnel makes over a million dollars I actually think that's cool to have an award that's based on an exact amount of money versus just [ __ ] design agency Awards we used to get which are just [ __ ] uh so I was I was excited to bring the team on a little trip to Nashville we went to funnel hacking live and we were fully converted we were just like Russell is is Daddy right like this guy is not as stupid as he looks he's not like this just pure scammy salesman he's just an unbelievably amazing copywriter uh and he's so good at packaging out products and honestly I don't even want to tell your audience about this because I feel like it's a bit of a secret in the like C because a lot of people just see him and just go ah [ __ ] this guy uh it is a little bit of a I don't know I feel I feel like it's something that not a lot of people openly say they like Russell Brunson um but I think his book expert secrets and then his traffic Focus book like how to get leads called traffic Secrets I think they're like the best marketing books I've ever read and I've read all the highbrow ones as well right I read all the ones that you're supposed to read but these ones are my favorites first of all thank you for being so brave thank you you know you could have you couldn't you could have just not said anything about clickfunnel said nothing about Russell Brunson being your daddy but but you did anyways and and I appreciate it because a lot of people listening to this probably ignore a lot of the ads and what they've seen about Russell um he definitely doesn't make his way around like silic and valy circles either not at all yeah and I'll be the first person to change my mind on something like that Mastermind conversation we had like a few minutes ago like initially I was like I'm not going to do I would never do a mastermind or I would never be I would never be involved in a mastermind and then after thinking about it I'm like you know what I personally might not want to lead a mastermind but I can see the value in it and maybe one of our teams runs it and now I'm starting to think oh maybe we should do a mastermind for this or we should do a mastermind for that yeah same with Russ Brunson like it sounds like there's probably some insights that he has that it's worth diving deeper even if you don't like the guy I think that I I I I feel like I've spent all of the money on all the marketing books and all of the marketing gurus and like I said Gary ve like all of these things and I haven't I haven't um seen someone create more actionable content uh or learnings than Russell Brunson for a small business that's the thing that's important we're not he does have a multi-billion dollar uh software company but which he uses these tactics to to sell stuff for but most mostly it's for info products meaning if you have a book if you have like um courses if you have communities um if you're looking at paid communities if you have like a patreon things like that his tactics are amazing for that kind of stuff teenage engineering shouldn't use his tactics it would cheapen what they do for example you call it a small business but like doing $18 million a year or doing $18 million or $10 million or $6 million if $2 million like these you know you're doing millions of dollars a year like if as as long as there's a decent profit margin there like that's a that's a great business I don't I you know it's a great business yeah I'm not I'm I think I just assume that uh because there's like this startup element of your podcast that I was thinking I'm coming in cuz also okay Noah Kagan has like a $38 million perear business or something Kevin Rose I mean Kevin obviously just balling out of control uh and then I am the next guest so I'm like I basically run a business that makes the amount of money of like a maybe a couple of restaurants in a in a city uh so yeah I just wanted to I just needed to clarify it so people don't take my advice and try to apply it to like something that's as big as something what Noah or Kevin do my my thing works great for uh yeah smaller operations which are not really built not being built to be sold necessarily um you know I I've spoken to people about selling AJ and smart I actually um Pro probably someone you also know I I I was chatting with someone on Andrew Wilkinson's team uh and like it is humbling to talk to these guys right when they're looking through the numbers of AJ and smart and they're like yeah like if you add another many more million onto it and uh automate a lot more systems and then get the profit margin up to this and then maybe we could you know but yeah it's we're we're still we're we're we're like a I I I call I talk about us like we're more like a high-end restaurant we're like it we're like a little high-end restaurant that has Global appeal just because we can use the internet but yeah we're not a startup that's getting any funding or anything like that JC unscheduled CEO this has been this exceeded my expectations and my it's over I don't want it to be over well we might do a part two of people like it and if people hate it then we certainly will not do a part two yeah are you actually gonna post this 100% cool okay yeah thanks for having on I really appreciate it it's it's gonna we're gonna we're posting the unfiltered full thing everything you are listening to right now happen and uh and uh Jonathan where could people find you on the internet um probably the best place to go is the uh unscheduled CEO podcast on any podcast platform you listen to I don't really use social media because I find it too addictive um if you're interested in the way we sell stuff at AJ andm you can check out ajsm smart.com um but yeah that's that's it really unscheduled CEO just hanging out beautiful all right I'll see see you around my man later for

to me strategy means deciding how you're going to win that means things such as my advantage or here's my strengths or assets here's how I'm leveraging those specific things I think in retrospect when a company has a good strategy it's easy to say what it was so you look at Netflix and you're like oh DVDs to the home so you don't have to do the walk of death that was smart and then when they realize streaming is even better cuz it's immediate I mean that was good so to me that is a strategy that that's like this is the critical idea that sets them apart that is unique it's hard to follow I would have a vision like helping thousands of companies succeed because they have the right strategy Jason Cohen welcome to the startup ideas podcast great to have you here and you've got a bunch of ideas you're an idea machine yourself and I just I'm excited to to dive in with you yeah you know I think it's funny uh I don't know that there's an area in the world that you can't make a startup in especially if you have aspirations of building a profitable business for a few people and not a unicorn for that employs thousands of people and makes billions of dollars those opportunities are fewer although once again you can probably disrupt anything with a sufficiently different idea but you know especially if you have more modest goals and I don't mean that in a bad way I mean that in simply a magnitude way um it's hard to imagine a area that you can't make a business in so I to me like the biggest thing there is a large and growing Market because if the if because that means people are spending money already more and more are doing that that means there is a problem to be solved or something people want done and it also means niches will constantly be blooming because as it as it expands like there's no way that the larger players can do a perfect job in all of the niches that's just never true um and so there's opportunities for again if if you don't want to make a billion dollar company then well their niches they too small for the people to certainly Target maybe even notice and then you can fit right in there so I think as long as it's a large and growing Market you've already taken some of the market risk out and you're already on the right path all right so you have some nuggets of some ideas I want to get to which one do you want to start with first whatever you want how about um this social media system that you have that you're thinking of maybe productizing what's this no I'm not thinking of productizing it nope all right well tell tell us about your the system I I you know I've used a lot of these uh systems where you buffer up stuff and sends out and that's a good idea to to sense the fat on a schedule I just find that um there's so much more to social media than that than the broadcast period And I just haven't found tools that um that work well for me in processing the other side of of that so like on Twitter well actually on any of them you know you should be interacting with people um and so how can you do that quickly almost like an inbox that you can move through very quickly some tools have things like that there's other rules on Twitter like if people have a follower to following ratio that's really out of whack and you interact with them it actually lowers your reputation and and and reach so you don't want to do that um so the tools should know that and kind of show you the things that you should react to maybe you should even sort it not in order of time but in order of maybe who it is that you're interacting with and then there's the reverse um you know you want to another another thing they say on Twitter and other things is well there's probably people your size maybe a little smaller maybe a little bigger maybe a lot bigger that's in your Zone that you want to interact with like you want to know them you want to Etc and so for example if they if if if they post something and they have a huge following and you have a very cogent useful great reply that can get a lot of likes and people might even follow you because they saw you that way and that's one of the things people say to do and I haven't really seen tools that are that good at it but it's not even hard to do that with Twitter itself so like if you go to tweet deck you can set up a search uh using a Twitter list in which you can you know keep updated with this set of people right um that's very easy to do because you can do it on all the clients um and then say search in that list for people who have tweeted and it's not a retweet and you know you might have conditions like that to get to these items now the trick to me of getting the comments to work is if they just posted it then if your comment gets in there um it might start accumulating likes and snowballs so that even though that thing might live for a day or 12 hours or whatever it does um you know perhaps you have a uh much higher chance of getting attention and getting this effect that I'm talking about if you were to post it immediately after their post not if you wait eight hours so you can add to that filter um how long it was since the Tweet so I had like 20 minutes like if it's longer than 20 minutes I'm just not even going to look and so that means I just go there and there might be just two or three things they tops at any given time but they're highly likely to be good and I uh I got this idea from a related but different story where um the CEO of Google was saying how it's impossible for him to use Gmail because it's just full of stuff you know right like it's just it's it's a disaster area so he doesn't really use it he says but what he does is he goes in occasionally and he just answers the email that's at the top meaning the most recent one um and he says what he likes about this is most people get exactly the experience they expect which is they email the CEO of Google and of course he didn't respond like why would he respond right but occasionally someone gets an an answer in like 40 seconds and he says he's imagining them thinking like I to seeo Google you answer 4 seconds this is a beast what who is this person how can this be you know so it's like yeah that's that's hilarious so that's sort of the application of that to Twitter is what I'm describing so I think that's pretty funny another thing I do and again I I have my own system for this that i' I've made that I'm not interested in turning into a product and some of it is kind of hacky with stuff like using puppet to control the browser and stuff like that so that that doesn't really scale um so another thing I like to do is um you spend a lot of time replying like how much time do you have in your day like like you know like probably this is too much time to to invent new stuff for your queue but also to have these really great replies that that are actually good don't just say yes I agree you know something really good that's worthy of other people's sharing or liking that takes effort so what I do is um when I make that reply I also have it C and and it's like that one of those kind um in my system it makes a copy of that into a draft C so then at other times I'll go through that and I'll rewrite them to be Standalone tweets with whatever the concept was but in that mental mode I don't have to come up with ideas I've already done that even with the way it's worded and stuff I'm just I'm just editing for purpose so I can just go through very quickly so by I've spent the time having a good idea and even even wording it well in the reply but then I sort of reuse it you might say for the que so that means my queue is very full very long so I never worry about having to come up with an idea um oh the other thing is those are scheduled at least three months later so that it's not really possible for someone to say didn't you just say that you know because it's like sufficiently removed from everyone's mind including my own you know it might as well be a brand new idea um and so that's a way to essentially double the the or reuse you might say the the efforts that I do have good replies and yet um that I I'm not wasting that time in a sense because I'm really filling my own queue also that's another thing that you could easily make the product do that um that doesn't take so much special effort so I think what you're saying is really interesting which is you've built a system for how you manage social media and whenever you've built a system There's an opportunity to productize that that system and sometimes it doesn't even need to be your own system so you can pick off on how other people are creating their sausage so to speak like especially in Social because everything you know a lot of not everything but a lot of it's public you're able to see that oh atreg Eisenberg often replies within five minutes to these people so I think it's really smart like that framework for you have a system how do you productize it I really like that the other thing I really like about this idea is how do you make the UI chat so for example you you you were talking about having replies come into this Gmail like experience I would totally use something like that if you know it told me here's like the 10 people you should respond to right now and it could also give me some ideas based on what I've said in the past and because there's real tangible value associated with that because replies are now being optimized in algorithms I would totally pay for that so I think I I love this idea and it would be also really cool if I was able to subscribe to not just like Jason Cohen system but Greg eisenberg's system or other people's systems and like the UI would change based on that yeah it could be the different systems are good in different ways I don't know I would start with one um I think a couple other things one is um like when I in in my system I don't say here's 10 I just do one at I just show myself one at a time so I'm completely focused and it might be 10 it might be one might be zero whatever like I'm not I'm not trying to waste time here and I'm not trying to make 10 replies that may be wrong maybe it's better to make more replies and it's just prioritized but uh that's how I do it I want to optimize my time um rather than how many things I write um I don't use AI but I agree that it makes sense it's like really obvious to use AI train it on your previous responses blah blah blah your style we all know AI is only only so good at replacing your style or reproducing your style and so on maybe there's some models that are better at that than others and so forth I'm not a big expert in that so I don't use that because I want it to be my own voice for real and my own ideas but I can absolutely see the idea of uh using AI to draft and then you edit it and this obviously could save you time it also depends on what your goal is if your goal is just to accumulate followers because you're going to sell them a course or something like that then I would use more Ai and blah blah blah because it's not really about you it's not even really about your ideas you're just trying to work the system and that's fine I'm not again I'm not saying that in it that it has to be bad it's it's marketing that's not what I'm doing I'm not interested in that I'm not selling anything I don't even run ads on my website like I I actually want to have my ideas and my style and interact with real people and that's it and and uh it is nice to have more followers I like that but my goal is not to accumulate news newsletter subscribers to sell them stuff my goal is is I suppose to accumulate people who are actually interested because I write you know unique stuff the end right that's the reason and so hence like I'm optimizing for something else and I'm not interested in AI making a response because it's just not uh because I'm not just accumulating it I really want it to be an idea that I had that's the point for me the other thing that would be really interesting is I'm not trying to call anyone out but these systems that that exist already of course there's a lot of them they always have a newsletter or something that gives you tips and there's random tips and it's not clear to me that that those tips are really validated they're just they just say that but like is there data that shows have they AB tested stuff and it always occurs to me like you have thousands maybe tens of thousands maybe hundreds of thousands of customers who've done stuff can you actually see what works better um could you AB test stuff within one account or across mult many accounts to see what works better um or other kind of data like maybe you paid for the huge Twitter fire host so you have a whole lot of data and you can actually analyze it no more I know there's looking at the algorithm itself I get that um but that's different than saying stuff like what's VI what's viral like oh you got to use a hook and then a this and then that that's the the the Twitter algorithm won't tell you that part right um I I have a feeling it's all of those things are not Based on data that they're really just based on people saying stuff and wanting to fill a newsletter with things that seem plausible but it seems to me like there should be data and if there's not who really cares what they say in the newsletter so I think there's probably some kind of opportunity in there to to say no this is actually a databased system and the and the product itself is testing things with us with all of us so that the product can improve for you and actually help you you know like I said respond within 20 minutes maybe it should be 10 maybe it can be an hour maybe it depends on other factors the bigger the account blah blah blah or I don't know I don't know that's the point I don't know maybe maybe posting at you know a lot of these things post at uh regular times well maybe it's maybe you should experiment with lots of times that seems obvious to me but like the tools don't want to do that so um my system doesn't do that I guess it could but uh I haven't put in the effort um and I'm also just one person in One account which probably isn't enough data to make many conclusions about anyway this is the point it's like I I think the question of how to quote unquote how to do social media well I don't think is very databased and you could potentially argue it's not possible to be databased cuz it's too complicated and there's too much the the noise of what happens online uh overwhelms any signal you could find um especially with things like this thing went viral and that's that's so unusual that that you can't really analyze it so if it's impossible okay I would agree with that too like I can understand if it's impossible I just don't feel like people are trying first and then concluding it's impossible I think a product that really did and even if it was a slight Edge or something um that might be a reason to use that product over the many other products there are for social the idea that if I create this post I tweet this thing and I could see a projected amount of types of replies and types of I don't think you could do that that would be I like who cares I don't need to project like I want to know like one thing I I think is true is Mondays and Tuesdays I get a lot more activity on on uh Twitter and it falls off pretty steeply on Thursday and Friday is very very quiet maybe even quieter than Saturday something like that I'm not sure though I probably do have the data to figure that out but I think it's something like that if that kind of thing is true you'd want to put more stuff out and engage more and blah blah blah on Monday and Tuesday and maybe save some of your stuff and not do the same thing on Fridays maybe you do some but not a lot or I don't know maybe it depends on how deep your queue is if you have a huge queue maybe go ahead and spit it out but if you don't like there might be uh because you're behind or whatever or just don't want to spend as much time on it um maybe it can be more judicious in where it puts it out I haven't seen any of the systems do that they could of course um they could just take the idea which is fine um but uh that's another one so I just think um it would be nice to take all these kinds of ideas and put them to the test and it might be different for different accounts I don't know that you have to say like oh if you word it this way you'll get more likes if that's actually possible that's great sounds so specific that I I uh I'd be shocked but maybe maybe you could look at an account and say look over the last year whenever you talk about these topics you just get more you get more reach I mean that right there would be very interesting yeah I mean I think I think there's a lot of people who would love to use a product like that even if it's just directionally correct if you spend a ton of time creating content and especially as the algorithms are are are becoming more for you page versus you know follower base where followers are becoming less and less valuable and and the type of stuff that's getting seen on on people's feeds has to be it's similar to like how Tik Tok works you want to make sure that the I mean I'll tell you who cares like I care when I when I I I basically when I create content I want the I want a lot of people who sign up to get my content to see my content so if I know that if I change this word or if I put an image or if I post it in the AM versus PM that I'll get 20% higher lift with 80% accuracy that product itself I would imagine there's a lot of people like me who would love to try that out yeah and and you know maybe those numbers are not possible like that kind of accuracy is is I I wouldn't be surprised if that's not possible but even if it was a small Edge again I think social media is like that where no not 80% sure of something and know that one word doesn't you know doesn't always work but if you if you just make it 6040 instead of 50/50 or you know you just push it a little bit more that's enough like or or or that's uh that may be all there is to do but the current tools don't even do that so totally so lots of good ideas there you can unbundle this idea in in a ton of different ways and and build something cool thank you for that uh you're second idea a simpler lower price segment um I'd love for you to explain that and for folks who don't know what segment is could you also explain that yeah so segment is a tool where um I guess you could call it a Clearing House of data you take all the corporate data about your marketing your websites your product even in internal corporate data potentially your your um your customer base and internal information and you can put it all together into segment you can send it all in some people call that a data Lake um then seg you can connect it all this this all takes extra effort this is not simplistic this is hard to do right but you can do it you segment can connect it all so you know some notion of a customer that that can flow through from the website to the product to backend systems um and then of course you can do stuff with it and uh besides reporting you can take action so you might do things like I me to segment all my customers for high value customers people have been here a long time people have just got here but they're using a lot of tech support um people who aren't customers yet but have other attributes that I want to segment based on um whether they've used certain features or not whether they're certain place whe they've gotten a certain distance through the onboarding process or something you know there's all kinds of ways that you could segment stuff and then act on the stuff right so maybe oh you've been in this segment for three days so I'm going to send you this email like just there's all kinds of stuff you could do to act on that depending on the on the circumstance there's even stuff like connecting it with retargeting systems so that you spend money retargeting only certain segments of customers you know so that might be like some kind of marketing spend optimization type of thing there's all sorts of all manner of stuff and if you want to do everything I just said you probably just need segment or one of their competitors that's it what I what what I think and that's fine that's that's a it's a it's a really interesting interesting product so when I say simpler lower price I mean segment is expensive and it's not simple but it does all this stuff so it seems to me like there's a lot of smbs who have no metrics or extremely bad at data just buying segment is out of the question like it's too expensive too difficult in any way they're not organized enough to have their data flow in and make sense um but if you could connect some of the dots that would already be pretty useful to them and maybe motivation for them to connect a few more dots and you keep it simple so for example um okay maybe it connects to hub spot so that you can segment customers and send emails maybe it connects to stripe for things like billing and maybe it just starts with that and you know there's already probably hundreds of thousands of yeah tens of thousands for sure maybe hundreds of th low hundreds of thousands of people who use those three things where you could already start to make some interesting um progress on and to end data in the company segmenting things making decisions getting reports taking actions and so forth segment was kind of like that at the beginning and they ended up going up Market often when that happens a void is Left Behind because the original concept that was more for engineers and was flexible and and simple that concept was still right it's still right today it's just that they left that for for more for higher arpu pastures that leaves some space behind the bad news about that is um whenever you're dealing with realtime systems that's a lot harder especially for a smaller company you don't have 247 teams you don't have the time to make things that work well at scale um that that's a multi-year difficult process for all companies including segment including WP engine including things like Twitter and Facebook back in the day like no matter how many smart people you have at the company as all those companies did um it's very hard um you Google famously tried to do wave and failed for two years and completely failed I mean these are Google Engineers they're the best ever at all this stuff and they're like yeah we couldn't make that work uh too hard to do that kind of real-time multi-user thing was too hard so the these are really hard things to solve so the bad news is it's hard the good news is uh that keeps out other competitors also sometimes things are hard and there's no benefit to overcoming the difficulty it's just hard and you're like well you could still do it but why are you doing that it's startups are hard enough as it is in this case I think the difficulty is rewarded with a product that is actually useful as evidenced by segments existence and in fact segments ex existence let's say 10 or 15 years ago when they started and that proves it was useful still is and and helps to keep out new competitors so that's actually a useful reason to be hard so for context segment was acquired in 2020 for $2.3 billion by twio it's a huge huge huge business and I think you're right like often times like these businesses kind of get lost along the way when they have to go up Market or down market and stuff like that and it creates these opportunities I also AG I don't think they're lost at all they simply changed their target market yeah I mean agreed they're they're not lost they're doing well they're doing billions of dollars in Revenue I think that segment for X is the big opportunity in my opinion so if you can create segment for lawyer segment for accountants segments for realtors and focus on these different niches that make it easy for them to understand the value proposition and allow them to integrate into their systems really easily I think that there's probably an opportunity probably an opportunity there whereas they'll go on segment.com the leading customer data platform powered by customer AI you know if I'm the chief Innovation officer of a a law firm or head of IT the law firm that might not speak to me as well as you know the leading uh platform for for law firms just like you and I think that's the opp opportunity that um that exists right now with with someone like this who's probably trying to scale to all sorts of different niches at the same time so I love this idea I don't think they have a niche Niche strategy exactly they don't have a segment for lawyers that's not what they're doing yeah they target marketing departments at companies that are big enough to have real data challenges but also can make millions if not billions of dollars if they get it it right or or maybe save that amount of money and and in marketing spend that's not as useful and uh that's what they target it's not a it's not a niche strategy exactly and that's fine just as we said at the top of the call if it's a large and growing Market which dat corporate data is totally a large and growing Market with no doubt about it um that means Niche is open up that the big guys don't even want to Target good don't right that's I like that I like how that sounds totally um if you were if you were starting this um idea how would you go about starting it I would want to know what is the vertical or Niche that makes sense um I don't think lawyers are a good Niche ever like the number of startups that try to do lawyers like it's a very very low probability success Niche it's just they don't get Tech they don't like to spend money oddly because they have a lot of money um it is true that if you get in there you might stay in there for 10 years um for the same reason so I guess that's good but just in general this is not a market where people readily spend money on software understand all that stuff know how to use it to create value for themselves and therefore stay happy successful customers and so those kind of things to me uh very rare to see that uh see that be as successful I say that and of course everyone can think of like one company that does do well and I would say right you can think of one you know how many startups you know attempt to do that thousands and you can think of one and so there you go um the companies that do really well in things like accounting and lawyers and dentists are 20 years old that's my point so I I would want to know what is that Niche it could be SAS companies uh because if you're a SAS company you're not afraid of technology and in fact you may instantly understand the value proposition why to do it even in the marketing department or maybe Tech in general or maybe it is a u an industry vertical maybe one where better since often it's good for marketing one where better marketing translates really directly into more Revenue so they can just see it I tried using this software two months later my Revenue was up or my cost went down noticeably so I don't need an Roi calculator I don't need a sales pitch like you can't Pride this out of my hands if you wanted to because I already see myself like how this pays for itself 10 10 times over so that could be something like Realtors because it is true in in in that like it's a marketing game because all reers are the same for the at the first approximation and so we're it could be other verticals where this is true like better marketing equals oh look I found it you know it could even be something odd like a media company so there's a lot of companies who make money off the website off of content whether that's ads which is the typical way or maybe subscribers and you know paid subscriptions and so forth anyway that's what I mean by Media Company there it is absolutely true if you get 20% more traffic and it's ads you make 20% more money it's simple as that there may be some Arbitrage on paid Market in order to do that as long as the make more money than you pay then this is this is automatically good so if something that was more sophisticated in metrics could help media companies get more views that equals more money again that's that's now now however you're you're starting to get closer to what segment actually does but again since it's expensive and they go after big stuff and it's you know integrating to lots of different systems that may be not um there may be plenty of space there there are certainly millions of media sites on the web like I'm describing um Millions so there's a lot there so the idea that there might be a niche in there um that makes sense uh that that seems plausible to me my advice for folks is go to where you have an unfair Advantage so if you have a you know an internet audience for nurses or healthcare industry that might be a good place to start um if it's for realtors that might be a good place to start now it might end up being a niche that isn't worth going after but it's definitely you know the first place that you should start yeah I would just say go to where you have unfair advantages for for for picking a niche in general I want to move to your third idea um which just says help people make practical simple strategies and that got my ears PE PE uh peaked up uh perked up so I was curious what you meant by that that idea yeah I think the challenge here is do people want it probably not do people want to pay for it maybe probably not so this might be a pretty bad thing it is a problem I think it is a problem but that's about all I can say do people agree it's a problem I don't know are they actively looking for a solution uh not sure like it's probably pretty bad but I do think it's a problem which is you hear strategy and I think um everyone has a different definition of it which is already a problem um and a lot of people conjure up these academic versions of strategies which I agree is not very useful maybe not useful at all and work and and uh um workshops like making a SWAT which I think is useless and my and my uh my evidence of that is it's rare that you do a SWAT and Come Away with some kind of insight you didn't know before and you it's also rare to ever reference one again afterwards like it's not like every month pulling up your SWAT because you're using it you don't okay well then how useful is it you know like so um so I think you hear strategy you think of these things and you're like H I don't need that and you're right to me strategy for what it's worth means deciding how you're going to win that means things such as and so I'm selling to exactly this group and this is my advantage or here's how here's my strengths or assets and here's how I'm leveraging those specific things in my way to win in my way way in my market that sort of thing is strategy to me so not a tactic like we're going to run an ad on this website or we're going to add this feature that's that's important too it's just not strategy that's that's your actual plan that's what you're going to do cool and for that being agile is also good because like in detail it's hard to say in detail you don't know which ad's going to work so you have to try so for that sort of thing being agile makes sense but for this Broad thing of like how am I going to win just being agile and saying I don't know I'm just going to throw a bunch on the wall regardless of what I'm good at or not as you just said that's not a that's not a good plan that's not a good way to find a good strategy I think in retrospect when a company has a good strategy it's easy to say what it was right so you look at Netflix and you're like oh DVDs to the home so you don't have to do the walk of death that was smart and then when they realize streaming is even better because it's immediate I mean that was good and there's their whole strategy in in you know a sentence or two so to me that is a strategy that that's like this is the critical idea that sets them apart that is unique it's hard to follow does it leverage a strength they had that I don't know I don't know anything about them maybe it doesn't I'm not sure but you know it it does explain how they're going to win if someone else had the same strategy then it would be a race um but since their competitors didn't have the same strategy uh their strategy was better turns out you know um it's really hard in the moment to come up with something that straightforward and yet be that compelling so but but don't you need that because it keeps your eye on the prize of like what is it like all the other tactics all the other things you're doing is is in service of this strategy this way to win this your way to win so how do you how do you make one of those how do you get there and if SWAT isn't useful what is like how do I analyze my strengths and my assets and my competitors and the market and you know ideas that that I have and stuff that I got through customer validation Etc how do I take all of those inputs and ideas and things and then arrive at a strategy that does what I'm saying but isn't uh you know academic and silly and 80 pages long and all that stuff which which not good right how do I do it so this is where I think um I don't know if you would quite say that software is the answer because clearly this is a human endeavor it takes creativity and so forth but can a system help if not collect the data then or collect those inputs which again is a lot of that is um is qualitative right but to the extent that there's quantitative fine to the extent that it's qualitative fine I mean even if that's sticky notes in in Meo whatever right but like stuff and then are there workshops or Frameworks or systems to help go from that to a strategy that's simple and makes sense um I don't think a tool will like come with the answers for you but it could walk you through some sort of thing kind of like a course does or a framework does or a book does could it support that so that um the busy work of that is easy and the structure of it is such that it sort of funnels you into having the right conversations you still have to have all the conversations make all the decisions right but could it help you make decisions in a good way could you could it help you arrive at a better decision by prompting properly challenging properly and again I think AI is is interesting here not because AI will come up with your strategy I do not believe that but could it help prompt could it help summarize could it help generate ideas not evaluate the ideas that's you but could it generate things um hey if I have these seemingly conflicting inputs you know people want all this stuff but they also want it cheap or um it seems like the only way to succeed here is to have all this complicated stuff but I'm just one person I have to I can't make a thing that's super complicated I have to make a simple thing these are my puzzles to solve these are the kinds of things that strategy is good for oh yeah that's a good puzzle now we're talking a strategy is how you're going to un un how you're going to solve that puzzle oh I'm going to make a product the target to this then they don't want it as complicated and then you know whatever the solution to a puzzle like that that's what a strategy ultimately is good for having having solve those and saying here's how I'm going to solve it okay nice could AI Identify some of these conflicts to cause you to have to resolve them maybe and if so that's really helpful it can't just solve it but could it generate ideas I have no idea I think it would take some prompt engineering and some and some practice maybe certain models are better than others I don't know but if it could generate like as long as we're brainstorming here could have generate brainstorming ideas to help you get to a good idea that you actually have maybe I could I could see that more so so again again there's a lot of maybe because of course I haven't done this or anything but um yeah maybe maybe as almost like a meeting facilitator type of thing or or a generator of Concepts and ideas could it help or one thing AI is pretty good at is summarization so if I have a bunch of inputs and stuff could I ask it like are there commonalities are there certain topics or there certain things that's the kind of thing it's actually not bad at so again like maybe there's there's a role for it as a facilitator or something to be helpful and to help you get to a place that would otherwise be too be hard or even that you wouldn't have gotten to um so is there something there and no idea but I'm I'm I'm interested because I feel like especially smaller companies especially bootstrap companies um have disdain for strategy and again I don't disagree with them because often when you just search strategy on the internet you see stuff I roll my eyes at that too so I I agree but again I I'm I think I'm painting a picture of a PR a an actually useful the definition of strategy and a system that could help anybody including a solopreneur making something that's not a unicorn um have a good strategy but you know kind of rightsizing what that means um that feels like it would be really valuable I don't think it's good to simply not know how you're going to win I don't think that's good I just can we have the right sort of tools right sort of process for that I'm very interested in that and as you can tell I don't have like the complete answer I have ideas I have specific ideas about those Frameworks that I've used and some of them I've written about as well but I don't claim to have the answer I think though if you could find an answer you could really help a ton of companies be smarter about what going about what they're doing maybe even actively drisking their companies by having a good strategy by good meaning good for them and good for their Market um you probably can't measure that at all but that doesn't stop you from making that the vision statement I would I would have a vision like helping thousands of of companies succeed because they have the right Strat yep I think you know suceed instead of fail and and like how do I know that oh I don't it's why it's a vision statement it's you it's an aeration it's it's a you know it's it's it's the it's the North Star it's not measured I don't know who succeeds and fails other like no I don't know but but having that in your head of like but that's that is what we're trying to do here even if we can't measure it that's still what we're trying to do like that that's actually quite helpful in in uh in staying the course of what you are trying to accomplish absolutely I think uh the Insight here is when you're in a boat it doesn't make a difference how fast you paddle if you're going in the wrong direction uh that's a problem and and and there's so much value in knowing the right direction and that's where strategy plays such a huge role in in this we uh we incubated um an agency called lay checkout. it's called LCA the website's late checkout. agency and we work with like the dropboxes and Nikes and Shopify of the world on strategy and product design and we also use like Ai and automation to figure out what their communities want and then we help build strategies around that however we only focus on these big companies so I think there's like a huge opportunity in in taking like that LCA model and to your point solopreneurs small companies startups there's definitely an opportunity to build some agency mix with AI and data application to get people's strategies as full Pro fullprof or as fullprof as humanly possible um so I like I like this idea and I do like agency businesses so I think as an agency model could work yeah you could IM you can even imagine um an agency having this as part of what makes their their agency product so I'm using that word in the general sense making their product unique in other words there's a lot of agencies that say we help you with strategy there's obviously various products and Frameworks and books and stuff about strategy okay fine you know our agency has a special system um we will help you through it we facilitate it we have all this experience etc etc and also we have these systems that we've the Unique Systems we've built um that help both of us be efficient and smarter about that so maybe you have this internal product as a consult as a as a um agency it's still you human beings helping because again I as I said all along I don't think the product nor AI can just magically find the right strategy I don't believe that I believe it can facilitate though or I say I believe I wonder if it could facilitate it so whether that's helping the agency facilitated much more efficiently for that agency getting to better results faster results um the more time the agencies people at the agency spend actually facilitating a meeting and less time messing around with all the stuff and reading everything summarizing and and organizing and you know the better the more efficient and and maybe it even works better I don't know um you know that's uh that's that's pretty interesting you could you could imagine the agency use creating material especially for lead gen but also just For Thought leadership on this topic so you could imagine that there is a course that they put out on strategy where they explain it um the same thing maybe they make money on the course but more I think more likely use it as marketing to say look how smart we are we can do this for you um like there's all kinds of things you could places you could go as an agency where rather than make this a product where you sell software instead it's part of your agency's offering and it just it just part of your thought leadership and showing how you're special and you have your own philosophy and and you just know what you're doing in other words and and I'm also like as much as I like all this and I have ideas about strategy um it it's certainly true that there's many ways of coming up with a good strategy there's not just one and so it's not even necessarily as the agency we have the best way to make a strategy that's not really what that's not what it is nor it doesn't need to be it just needs to be that you're really good at it you have a way that works really well you the agency you are expert at this particular way right and so sure there's probably 20 decent ways it's just this is one of them right and we're really good at it um we've even built you know our own materials our own software to facilitate it um so we're just really good at this particular way works really well we're not disparaging the way that's right next to us it's fine but this is what we do I think that's uh that's a very I don't want to say humble but that's a very realistic way where you don't have to make crazy claims about being best in the world or nonsense like that and yet you can make a very credible case that like we're really good at this you should just hire us like you could read a book like um read blue ocean you know all right you could read it and try to do stuff in there you can and we're we're not against that you know there's some good ideas in there of course but we know how to actually go from A to Z we know all the letters in between we have this really great system here's materials about to wet your appetite get you interested and like that sounds fun that sounds like could be useful that sounds actually practical and not not just silly exercises H see so let's go you know it's it's not the blue Ocean's bad it's just this is our way and if we can convince you our way is is uh effective and and maybe even fun um then let's let's go um I think that'd be pretty cool yeah I think uh you know if you're thinking about building an agency business starting with the system is a good place to start um and then you can start creating content around that system get people bought into that you know some people will connect with that system and some people won't and that's okay um but the people that will you know a lot of them are going to be like well I can implement system myself but it's going to take me a bunch of time I'd much rather work work with you to help implement this and bring this to my company um I think the yeah I mean look that's that's what the authors of all these books do now sometimes the book does so well that they don't have to do it personally but usually they still have their consulting company and just have other people do it but like the blue ocean people get paid to teach people blue ocean right and a lot of these systems are like that where it's like oh so that's that's exactly what happened once their materials got very popular but you don't have to be as popular as that to have good material so that when you are doing your sales calls in your ways you have an edge over the next agency just says I do strategy here's three customers who are happy you can call them yes we all have that right every agency has that so yes there's nothing wrong with that but it just doesn't stand out like so what yep exactly and it's getting more and more competitive to start an you know to start an agency because what's required it's really just a landing page and a brand and a domain name so yeah yeah I agree the systems really help help stand out um Jason thank you so much for for jamming on ideas there's a there's a lot of good stuff here um for people who are are listening to this on Spotify and apple please uh follow subscribe leave a comment and then subscribe on YouTube just search my name Greg Eisenberg um and then for folks who want to follow Jason uh I follow him on Twitter

the knots as they say another startup so that's where I got the handle as smartbear on Twitter and as smartbear.com for all those articles I mentioned beautiful all right well thanks for jamming and

have you seen this dude Martin Reese he's the water Somalia he worked in a restaurant or like in the restaurant industry for like 20 years he's blown up on socials now so I've actually seen this guy on Tik Tok I saw him like go into a Costco like review different Waters and that just goes to show you like you can be whoever you want to be yeah that's why branding and naming is so important is you want to brand and name yourself something that people think of you and they're like oh I need a water so I need a sleep so and we're live but we're actually not live on the where it happens podcast are we not R rip the where it happens podcast we have a new name let's hear it the startup ideas podcast wow now I know you're thinking you're like you couldn't come up with a better name than that and that's the whole point of the name there's a million podcast out there talking interviews interviewing entrepreneurs but I noticed that we just kept talking about startup ideas on this podcast so I figured let's name it when you think of startup ideas when you think about getting your creative juices flowing you're going to come to the startup ideas podcast and uh Jordan it's great to have you here chatting some ideas with me today it's great to be here startup ideas podcast take a sip take a sip yeah I mean I want these these conversations to be more like jams like startup idea jams like we have the them all the time where we're kind of like hey I saw this thing on Twitter uh this huge opportunity in XYZ what do you think about that or you know just these random ideas you and I are both startup idea junkies so this podcast is for people like us and uh My Hope Is that people take these ideas and run with them that's the beauty of it one idea will trigger the other ideas too you know um exactly yeah there's a big Trend that I'm noticing just in Social content and across the board people's desires to just be a fly on the wall and where it happens how to that uh feel of being in a room where you're not supposed to be but being a fly on the wall for jams ideas sparking ideas I'm excited to uh see where this goes and have the conversations continue in the comments sections on YouTube and maybe success stories people starting ideas from the startup ideas podcast all right so cheers to you got I got a coffee or something a bottle of water plastic water Mr microplastics himself Jordan mix on the Pod I didn't want to be this guy but saratogo was all sold out because the microplastics are too trendy so I'm a microplastic man today unfortunately did you see live oasis.com live- Oasis oh what is this so I think it was s par who tweeted it um it's a directory of water so I just I pulled up the website do you know what's in your water 90% of your water contains toxins microplastics and other contaminants and then you can go and see like there's AOW on Spring Water Castle Rock Water you know you can click into it there's my Saratoga boom Oh know but it it'll tell you like how much you know the microplastics what are the contaminantes and how to buy it what do you think about this business yeah I I'm checking out my Saratoga spring water which I've been on recently and I'm sad that it's it's all locked behind payal content but I don't think this is the best way to monetize this business but I really like what they're doing here it's really clean clean directory and they have the tap water ratings too yeah so for $10 a month you can unlock all the data the ratings the research there's AI search search personalized recommendations so these are one of these like I I I I'm happy that this exists but it should be unpay walded because I just think that it's not like you're switching water that often right like you're you're a Saratoga person or you're a what is it Mountain Valley Water Spring Water person so you want to know what what your contaminants are in your in your daily water but you know you're not going to keep it for 5 years so my question to you is if you were running this how would you monetize it yeah let's jam on that so this is a Sprint to monetization but there's a bunch of there's a bunch of things you can do here I mean an affiliate is is one way to do it which is pretty obvious but another thing you can do is upsell a report based on your water resour like I know that the like the tap water locally um you could get a a lead magnet report and then match someone to come out and test your water at your house so I was at Costco once and these guys were like basically trying to get me to bring tap water back to them to Costco to like show me that like there was a bunch of hard medals and stuff in the tap water and they they basically sold a $9,000 like water softening system that they put into your house and that was an ey openening experience it was like a $300 test test report and then a $9,000 like system and I think that would be a really use this site as the top of funnel and monetize it with backend Services based B on the information that you provide what do you think about that yeah I mean the problem with water is you're not spending a lot of money on water you know if you go to the website it shows like different filters that you can buy that are hundreds of dollars and doing affiliate to that like that's obviously where more of the money is I actually get have you heard of a live a live water uh so alive waters.com so I get this delivered to my house in Miami and they've got a whole good stick with like it's alive water and I don't even know what that means like there's some like I honestly have no idea like I'm trying to read like what you know certain water is dead certain I don't know apparently like the alive water is good for you I don't know if I'm getting fleeced or whatever but yeah probably I think it's like from a spring it looks like like from living you know moving I guess exactly so that's that's the thing and you get these really cool looking jugs they kind of look like Crystal jugs do you see them yeah I'm in and they have these trucks that deliver it and there's these like guys who deliver it they look like they're from they all look like they're from Venice California they're like wearing like fedoras and and uh like ponchos and stuff like that like they're they're very like in touch with themselves they're like these good-looking guys and they come and they put you know do the water delivery anyways that's my life now and we spend a lot of money on it so I wonder if you can just sell the you can sell those those leads basically to Someone Like A Live Water you could also make products that I mean these got they've got these Crystal jugs but there's other form factors that you could you could make and cell as well or partner with like some artist or something and do some like collab vessels and make your water feel like art and have it be a talking piece in the home I think that's I'm big into those things right now yeah it is it is a talking piece like people people show up to my apartment and they're like whoa what is that like weird looking Crystal water thing oh let me tell you about alive water yeah you know so uh let me tell you why I'm an idiot for hundreds of a month on water is your water dead what do you mean your water's dead bro yeah have you seen this dude Martin's uh Martin Reese no he's the water somala no who where's this guy been my whole life I know he worked in a restaurant or like in the restaurant industry for like 20 years he's blowing up on socials now and I guess he has a film I'm looking at right now but he literally is a Somalia of water I didn't know that this was a thing until I saw Martin the water somier so I've actually seen this guy on Tik Tok so I think he I saw him like go into a Costco and like review different Waters I didn't know he's a water soier and that just goes to show you like you can be whoever you want to be um you so I guess the trend that you know people can take away from here is soier for X like what's something that requires some curation and expertise but that you can be that SoMo so that people can come to you the carbon monoxide SoMo exactly do you sleep with the your door closed in your room I'll give you sleep somea is just like a no-brainer huge idea lay up like are you kidding me I can't even believe we're giving that away for free tap tap in birdie for the Masters this week totally like if I'm eight sleep like I'm creating an Instagram Twitter account I'm hiring a Creator in house it's the Sleep SOA brought to you by a s like come on I mean is this is this pot over yeah it's it's we're done here like that idea is just too good cuz there's there's the all these baby sleep coaches you know like when new parents get baby sleep coaches there's no adult sleep coaches like someone that could analyze I guess there is but I don't know about them well I think it's it's just about branding yourself as that person I mean even what I'm doing with this pod it's like okay the startup ideas pod I want people to think I need creative my Creative Juice is Flowing bam I'm going to go like listen you know I'm I'm commuting for 30 minutes I'm going to go put on Greg for a bit that's why branding and naming is so important is you want to brand and name yourself something that people think of you when they when they have the need and they're like oh I need a water some I need to sleep some and podcasts don't really do that like they all have cute really cute names yeah well it's all like The Joe Rogan Experience Lex Friedman podcast it's very personal brand driven right um you're starting to see a few like Diary of a CEO I mean that's just like I don't I don't love that name personally put there like yeah it just seems so I I I love I I think he does an incredible job on his pod like incredible and he's an amazing interviewer and his sets are amazing and he's a he's a professional versus like someone like me who's an amateur um but I will say like just diary of the CEO does not connect with me at all I just very much like people trying to figure out routines and processes in the story behind diary like when I think of diary I think of like dear diary yeah I don't want to write the diary yeah I'm not dear diary like I interviewed Jordan today and he didn't laugh at my joke so yes going going back to it I think like yes having the name owning that expertise uh really important and thinking about like as a framework soia FR I think with going back to live Oasis I think it's on one hand I I don't like the business because when you start a business you like this you don't want to be selling $20 or $40 a month worth of product you want High ticket stuff so I don't love that but I think it could transition into more High ticket stuff like if they do more high-end subscriptions if they do more high-end water products but if I was running this here's how I would change it I think the bigger Trend in movement is around clean everyone talks about clean clean is our generation's version of low fat in the 80s and 90s everyone was talking about low fat low fat this low fat that that's why diet cola got so big then there was just lowfat sections within grocery stores but then we realized that turns out a lot of that stuff was not good for us aspartame not that good for us sucralose not that good not not that good for us so now we're in this conscious world where clean things are good for us and you're either clean or you're dirty if I was live Oasis I would be building the directory of clean that's the huge opportunity and I would never have a pay wall like build that SEO juice I love it yeah run the ACP framework on it just and just explain what the ACP framework is for people who don't know audience Community product so building a build the audience the directory of clean people can see the directory of clean and subscribe to the directory of clean and then maybe there's like a clean badge or like a clean coin um or some momentum that you get or momentto that you get and you get involved in this like community and then the products can be all the things that we talked about Affiliates and selling services or upselling other people's uh leads or systems so but yeah I'm frustrated at this pay wall like I checked out it and I was like immediately I'm a I churned so I'm just mad yeah totally um cool so what I what startup ideas are on your mind right now we got a couple got a couple simple ones uh around uh productivity some low hanging fruit uh Mac OS apps I'm really frustrated with notion and it's just very big and clunky and I don't enjoy opening it do you like notion i i i sigh because I'm I wish I want to like it like notion is like WhatsApp for me you know like I I log on to WhatsApp and I'm like I want to like this but feels like Android it's the best way to describe it and what I don't like about notion is for me it's like slow and I need fast so I use notion to write uh startup ideas I have and content ideas I have so I have this running these two running lists that are super super long and when I open it up it's just slow so and then it just like ruins my flow so I've been actually using more of Google docs Apple notes and then I use notion just because L checkout uses notion and I want to see everything but yeah we pay we pay thousands of dollars a month for notion like two three I don't know thousand a month it's crazy yeah I just wish I liked using it more I did use to love it and then yeah slow clunky the formatting and stuff and then I've started using Apple notes as well cuz it's so quick fast but the thing about notes is they need to be readable and digestible so you can reference them and that's my gripe with Apple notes is it takes like 20 clicks to format something so I really want there to be an Apple notes version that is lightweight notion like if notion and Apple notes got together and like basically created an MVP to make beautiful readable notes nothing more I would use that in a heartbeat and I think a lot of people would use that as well I think having like an AI piece to that where it just takes your notes like notion could build this where it just takes your notes and just puts it in a Zone with a lot less clutter and just like formats it but like they're probably not going to build it yeah so I think what James Clear just put out with his Adams habit app I think there could be this lightweight flexible app that basically just had toggles some headings and maybe even like AI for formatting too so like TR you you can kind of train the the app on how you format your notes and you could basically have these things shorthand formatted like how you do headings how you do bullets Etc I just love my notes to be really dialed and have pictures and colors and things because that makes me actually go back to read them yeah exactly I go into notion and it's just like it's like a wall of text and ites me like some anxiety so and and the thing about notion in a lot of these tools is that it puts the onus on the on the user to create the headlines to bold certain things and I think the future of content creation tools and productivity tools is the machine should know what you're thinking and should automatically format things like formatting will be a thing of the past it'll autof format things for you and then you you can just edit and realize oh hey you know I wanted to make this bold and it was italicized yeah it'd be beautiful that' be beautiful right I'd get fired up by that I would love opening that and I think that's what I'm that's how I'm judging products these days it's like do I love opening them like I love opening figma why it just fires me up it's just beautiful I see other people's Creations in there when I'm reviewing work you can the infinite the infinite canvas you can just buzz around it and yeah just it It's associated with creativity and productivity together so I just love opening figma well so it's it's bottling up that feeling so if if the go if if the what was his name the water suier guy yeah like you're bottling up this idea around this person who's like dressed in formal and who knows everything and you're getting this High touch experience in the same way that figma even the word figma and you think of spatial and moving around in a BL in a blank canvas and colors like it it feels like this fun creative zone so whenever you're creating a product you have to think about what feeling I want to give to people and I think that's that's a that's what you're picking up on yeah so that's that's one that's if anyone wants to do that let me know I'll beta test it for sure um uh and then another one is just my desktop's always messy and I hate cleaning it but I love seeing everything on like a big desktop style view it just it feels good and um so I have this little idea that someone probably could build in a weekend so do this it's called the upside down uh little little nod to stranger things but basically it's a alternative desktop that's behind the scenes that it's basically just a file folder but looks like a desktop so you can save things to the upside down but it's not your actual desktop so your performance will increase and your computer will perform better and then you can have a clean desktop but when you want to see that messy desktop you just go to the upside down and all your files are are everywhere would you use that I would use that I I feel like my flow is I wait until I get 12 files on my desktop and then I'm like I'm an adult I can't have 12 files on my desktop this needs to go and like I'll I'll look at it just like quickly and be like yeah I don't think I need any of these things and I just throw them all in the trash yeah um and I do this every 10 days so yes I would love I would love that and sometimes I like seeing yeah to your point I like kind of I like seeing everything just in one place even if it's chaos yeah um because it Sparks ideas and reminds me of certain things and then you can flip it back yeah with a background too that doesn't look like a file folder like it's got a beautiful picture you could even have multiple upside Downs you can have your personal upside down work upside you know uh but they're basically just folders but it just feels psychologically different than searching things in a folder I like this idea it reminds me a little bit of the Clack app basically what the Clack app is is it's a Mac app that turns your keyboard into like High Fidelity sounds like a mechanical keyboard so it turns your regular keyboard into a mechanical keyboard um just with software so and you can like change the volume and change the switches and how it sounds and everything which is really cool and it's like $5 I bought it Nob brainer it like breaks half the time which sucks um but I imagine like they even with like a half working app it still probably generates hundreds of thousands of dollars a year of Revenue and uh I think we're going to see a lot more of these simple mac apps yes I was just thinking I don't know if it's economically makes that much sense but it would be so cool if these were rolled into like a holding company or like an app Sumo type marketplace where you could get the Clack you could get screenshot X which I use for screenshot I just saw this girl like basically made like a loom kind of screen recording competitor that looks beautiful I forget the name of it um I'll have to I'll have to find it we can put it in the show notes for people I think it was like screen ify um I would love to plug her because she's just an incredible maker but um like rolling these things into like helping them get discovered helping them monetize selling them as a bundle I I just love these like beautifully done productivity apps that make work life so much better totally yeah there's definitely a hold Co opportunity there and you know if you can buy some of these smaller apps like clack put them under um maybe give them some Capital to make it work better and add more Engineers a lot of these people are just Solo solo people so yeah I think there's a huge opportunity there and like the way to do it is you scour you scour product hunt and you don't scour today's product hunt but you scour like six 12 18 months ago and certain things lose Steam and then you reach out and you see if you can make a deal yeah that's good I think that would that' be really cool that would be cool that would be cool um what else you got for me what else we got um swag up for premium blanks like basically I've been trying to do for my little brand do within make a couple sample hats and I'm just frustrated with the whole process of making a hat that is not just a print on demand or embroidery on demand type of thing but I also don't want to start a hat company and like don't want to be in like a direct consumer merch situation and we think about this a lot with late checkout too and how can we have highquality products that we can give our customers team members you know future partners and I think there's a big opportunity for a brand in a box for gear that feels really cut and sew high quality but isn't a print on demand type you know churn and Burn System so I think you layer on 3pl like in fulfillment on the back end of that warehousing Etc and you could basically build like a Marketplace if you have the um the suppliers and the production you could facilitate these like brand in a box experiences for companies that are not traditionally doing things like IRL or with physical products so I saw notion a couple weeks ago launch these like really beautiful chore jackets and it just had the like the little notion icon and I don't like using notion but I would wear the mess out of that thing it was so cool and the photo shoot was amazing and I I think there's just these internet-based businesses are going to want to close the loop on IRL and have provide real life experiences real life gear tangible things and it's not easy to do that right now it's dealing with factories dealing with Logistics all of the things so I think there's a big opportunity to make like a gear brand in a box for internet native companies and highend highend right so I think one of the cut and so yeah one of the insights there is that most tech companies and a lot of companies now just have swag but it's the same Gilden t-shirt or whatever hat and you're trying to stand out you know so how do you even if the cost is 2x or 3x like happy to pay that if it's 3x word of mouth or 4X or 5x Word of Mouth like I'd rather produce less but have higher word of mouth so I'll tell you story I don't think I've ever told you this so in 201 178 uh with Islands which was like a Discord startup I was running and it was like a Discord that became popular on college campuses we wanted to get College we wanted to grow more on college campuses so what did we do we hired you know an amazing fashion designer her name is Melissa gross she's done she's designed stuff for like the weekend and did stuff with Justin Bieber and like OVO like all like cool stuff and she had she had a factory in Downtown LA through her company gross garments and we produce like really cool hoodies really cool creu sweatshirts and just like everything like beautifully done and then we did a photo shoot in LA with like aspirational college models basically um guys and girls who like if you were in college at the time you would look up to them and what we did is we created a shop if I store and on islands's website and it would be $100 $150 for a sweatshirt $80 for a hat $70 for a T-shirt and it all said sold out so we use that to give to people on college campuses because they wanted it so badly because it's sold out and then all of a sudden like the word of mouth train begins so that was like a really really easy way for us to create a lot of word of mouth on a bunch of college campuses as a company um by not spending a lot of money really so smart word of mouth Arbitrage word about Arbitrage what you're saying is basically that in a box yeah yeah yeah to the tune of like aund yeah it's like if I want 100 custom hats I can get them and it's like yeah I'm paying double the price or maybe triple but it's a loss leader for what you're actually trying to do you're not trying to profit off of these things like I think hats are Billboards like I'm rep repping the Masters right now for free you know pay me up Masters um but yeah like I think the movement and the the word of mouth Arbitrage that's the ticket right there um so just making that really easy to do and if it goes well then maybe it does become like a e d Toc Ecommerce Tycoon um but the master the Master's hat is an interesting example because where did you get that hat at the Masters exactly so and how do you is it correct me if I'm wrong it's not easy to get a ticket to the Masters no my brother-in-law won a lottery so what you're saying is you either need to be extremely connected have a lot of money or win a lottery to get access to buy that hat and people who see that hat know that like people who know the Masters know that yeah so that's another way to think about merch is is it's almost like a check you you you know you've been here right like you you've done this thing so it's like for notion for example like if you you know write 100,000 words or whatever it is you you get the notion hat or something like that so that's another way to think about like it's not just about giving out merch it's like how do you layer on yeah levels and gamification and that's where this whole like you know Community B based approach I think is is to it is you create these layers and you create you don't just create one merch item you create eight merch items and you don't just create one level you create eight levels yeah and make it aspirational like the play button for YouTube you know like people drive for the play button on YouTube like they're like that's their main goal uh I love that totally I mean literally 36 minutes ago I got an email just pulled it up I just got a invited to join the top voice program on LinkedIn wow congrats top boly screens shot what a legend call my mom gotta call my mom yeah but like little things like that thank you uh to God for uh the top voice badge um but yeah things like that right like doesn't cost them anything LinkedIn anything to create to create that bad but a lot of people want it and I got that email I was like cool like great great start to on Monday let's let's let's rip yeah let me post more on LinkedIn yeah even if it's subconsciously right and the same thing with your hat it's like oh yeah I'll watch I'll watch the Masters it's like of course I'll watch the Masters I have the Hat yeah I might take a nap during it you know Jim n's smooth voice in the background too good too good all right man this has been fun inaugural episode the startup ideas podcast if you're listening to this you got to share the podcast

the cold harsh truth is that N9 out of 10 startups go to zero like they can just completely fail but the thing that always turns me off from an entrepreneur when they come to pitch is if they lead first with the market size the opportunity from a revenue standpoint and it's clear that they think I'm doing this because it's a chance for me to make a lot of money the harsh reality is times are tough and if you don't love the idea if it's not something that you wake up and jump out of bed in the morning thinking about then you're just going to get burnt out Kevin Kevin Rose sted to have you here thanks for having me appreciate it this is going to be fun you're you're an idea machine and how I know you're an idea machine is I texted you not too long ago and I was like do you want to come on the show bring a couple startup ideas you're thinking about and Bam you had you had pure pure fire I mean I have ideas at the ready uh most of them half quarter baked um and a lot of them are horrible so I just put that big caveat out there out front to let you know that like you know I think it's it it it's kind of been in my DNA for a long time just to say what if you know and just keep dreaming and and see if there's anything there and do you do you have like a a notes file where you keep your ideas or how how do you how do you think about it yeah I mean I used to have just like a little Journal next to my bed and I find that ideas for me are often times I mean there's a reason they call them like shower ideas it's it's not necessarily when you're putting concerted effort on trying to come up with an idea I find that if you're under stress or in a high stressful situation actually is probably the worst time to be kind of ideating on something um so for me it's more like you know I can't fall asleep I'm thinking about one thing or another and then all of a sudden I'm like huh that would be really interesting to prototype like what if that existed in the world and so that's kind of led to a bunch of my experiments um you know that I've launched over the years that's when I launched dig it was I I remember the night I was laying in bed and I was like no one is like voting online and if you could have a way that you could vote and the best stuff would rise to the top and this is 2004 you know I'm dating myself but it's like that's what led to like the whole you know thing that became eventually the like button and everything else which was this idea that you could use asynchronous JavaScript to update a number dynamically on the screen and so that was uh that was crazy but uh yeah it's just been been nights like that I actually want to go into that a little bit you know because for me I'm a bit of a historian when it comes to internet products that have worked like to me all that's new is old and I I think there's a bunch of products dig included that never really saw its maturity do you find yourself well my question to you is what and I'm putting you on the spot like what what product that got a little bit of validation 10 15 20 years ago that you think that if it had a Resurgence today has some L yeah I mean it's you know it's funny just to go back for a second on the whole dig thing not to defend my idea but the idea that um you know social voting became a thing and dig did not win we failed but you know we grew to 38 million monthly uniques and then you know face introduced the like button about a year later I'd had multiple dinners with Zuckerberg talking about social voting and things like that and so you know I i' like to just surrender to it and say hey that idea lived on and and I'm I'm glad that you know continued to make its way and propagate throughout the internet so I think that oftentimes you know we see this with startups I was just thinking about this the other day because I was going back to visit my mom um who lives in Las Vegas and um I I I SP my childhood there and I was driving around in none of the places that knew about like I hung out at business-wise were were still around like it was like very few and I was like gosh like every business CHS and and and come becomes something new and they just drop off no matter how amazing they were a decade or two decades ago right and so I feel like the internet is the same way I mean there's very few players I don't know how the hell eBay is still in business given their horrible user interface but like it's like there's certain incumbents that are really hard to to Dethrone but um yeah I mean I think that there's certain ideas that you know either were before their time you know there was um multiple photo sharing apps before Instagram and then you know there was like the addition of filters and the ease of use of Instagram and it just had that right mixture of features and functionality that just hit when mobile was really taking off I I'm bummed about for four square I think four square was a really cool idea this idea of being able to dynamically share with your friends Where You Are to facilitate hanging out and spending more time with the ones that you care about um it's it's too bad I mean that had a good run it had a good you know seven or eight year run and then kind of people fell out of fashion and something else took over I think probably more on the Snapchat uh chat side of sharing but um yeah I mean it's there's there's just a bunch that either you know they have their moment they have their 15 minutes of fame or five or seven years of Fame and then we're on to the next thing just because we've evolved as a as a society totally and I think uh so I don't know if you know this about me but I was actually at stumble upon which was yeah with Garett like exactly with a we were like cousins with dig you know basically was like dig stumble upon Reddit um and back then like Reddit was actually not that big uh it's weird you know now it's a publicly traded company and and and doing really well but um I remember when dig had its redesign and a lot of users came to stumble upon and then I remember we did a a redesign and we messed up and then a lot of those users went to Reddit it's interesting because it's not like the product didn't it's kind of like we messed up the timing was wrong we kind of messed up you know speak on behalf of the stumble Pond Side um there were some like mistakes that were made but a lot a lot of like the fundamental thesis around people want send like that exists today on places like Tik Tok 100% so I think it's like that's why I love going back in time looking at things like dig looking at things like four square Four Square I think you're completely right like the whole idea around um I feel like just the gamification of local no one's done yet yeah it's it's it's four square for me was one of those things that was really fun and we used it at South by southw a lot when that conference was really starting to take off and when you were living in the Bay Area it was kind of a signal to say hey I'm going out to this place and I don't think we really fully it was a much smaller group of users back then and it wasn't like um it's toxic as I feel it can be now and so there wasn't concerns over privacy there wasn't concerns over you know is somebody going to if I check in at a bar or restaurant is somebody weird going to like stalk me here you know which I think we get a lot more of that these days with just various groups trying to you know either dox individuals or take them down and so I don't know I can speak for me personally like I certainly have a lot more privacy concerns than I did back then maybe it was the youth and how I was just young and carefree at that time but um yeah it's it's it's a bummer that went away because it was actually it was more than just saying this is where I'm at it was also saying I approve this location I like it and you know for square was used as a as a a kind of fun Discovery app of what were the cool places to go to you know like what was the best cocktail or best burger in town or you name it and I feel like it's it's a shame we lost that and I think Dennis is working on something similar again did you see this I haven't seen his latest I mean obviously I saw swarm back in the day but I haven't seen what he's he's building now yeah so I think he it's interesting because he did Dodgeball right which was that's right yeah which was basically Four Square and sold it to Google and then he did four square which was awesome and then but pivoted to B2B and I think is like an actual real business doing really well as a B2B play and I think he's doing something again similar to DOD bomb for square again so it's like that's again just speaking to the same like you can just reinvent the same old idea and just sort of bring it back to the times yeah it's it's it's funny it's like when I think about you know the social voting and news and that whole side of things one I think AI is going to does we don't really need humans as much as we did back then for this type of stuff and two I I just I can't bring myself to ever want to build in that space again because you know controlling the masses are trying to um create an environment where there's like just a real good civil debate and not hate and spam and everything else it's just it is an absolute nightmare so I I would never want to enter that Arena again totally too many I'm I I feel the same way it's it's it's it's tough but you know social in general is almost like being an artist like you love it and hate it at the same time and um that's that's why we're addicted a lot of people like me and you are addicted to it because we we love just the I mean it's just fun to build and I think the interesting thing Nikita beer once said something that always resonated with me he said that uh building socials like you're building a rocket ship um but if you're 1 mm off you don't land on the moon and I think that's so true yeah and it's it's brutal when it's just um an open taxonomy where people can Define any type of group that they want right because then you get clicks of you know you may have had the you may have been quite well intentioned when starting something like this but then you all of a sudden wake up and you're like why am I taking down like you know non-stop hundreds of posts around hate speech or whatever it may be and it just turns into something that is I don't know I've got a couple little kids now I have better I got my podcast that I'm I'm doing every week and it's like I I have better ways to spend my time you know let the let the younger generation that's coming up tackle those problems so what is on your mind these days I mean let's let's walk through some of your some some of your startup ideas yeah for sure I mean I I spend it's it's interesting my my these days is split between doing some investing at true Ventures so i' I've been there for around seven years or so um you know so I'm always looking at kind of the latest early stage startups so back a napkin ideas uh I love that I love the very early stage it's it's a ton of fun and then you know I also spend a lot of my time interviewing experts on my podcast and so that can be you know AI health and wellness technology um it just all these types of conversations that I'm having anyway um that I just want to record and put online so it gets me in front of a lot of thinkers and that gets my own brain going around ideas so there's a lot of stuff that I wish existed but I've just never uh built and I don't ever plan on building so yeah I'd love to talk about some of them but I would say first and foremost kind of AI has captured obviously all of our attention over the last you know six to eight months to year um in that it's become a daily tool that I use for a whole variety of of different things um one of the things I I have two AI related startups one is around a Next Generation podcast app and the second one is around um really well they're both around uh kind of one is around interacting with dead people so which one do you want to tackle first let's start with let's actually start with the podcast idea and before okay before we get into it when you texted me that idea I was like podcast app so many people have tried it um I'm thinking of like Leah Culver uh her app um you know it's uh breaker breaker was like the closest I saw to like a really interesting um product um that was going to hit escape velocity but got acquired like why hasn't a podcast app been able to hit mainstream that's not Spotify and and apple yeah I mean when you're when you're Spotify and apple you have built-in distribution right like you've got people coming for the music um on the Spotify side and apple you have default installs on device so it is um that's hard to compete against uh in my mind whenever I'm thinking about a startup you know a new idea I'm thinking about what is the the defense ability what is the moat that they can build and then truly what is the order of magnitude Improvement that is going to make people switch people don't switch because you have trim silence people don't switch because you have you know a couple little features that they they sound good on paper but then the bigs catch on meaning like I'll give you an example like uh I can't remember who it was first that did trim silence and saved us a bunch of time on podcast where it takes someone and that they pause for four to five seconds it just cuts that out completely I want to say it was pocketcast but it could have been someone else and what happened then is you know you basically have that feature start to gain momentum product managers inside of Apple say huh that's a pretty cool feature and then they add it inside of the Apple podcast app you know six or eight months later and so you you really are not going to to win that way it has to be something where the the actual idea itself is so hard for the competition to Pivot into and it's so radically different that the consumer says wow this is a huge change in a huge New Direction that's why I want to make the move and abandon where I've been SP all of my time because you know it's like redefining a social graph it's like redefining your podcast graph takes time um and so it has to be a pretty great product to get you to convince you to do so so in my mind you know the application of AI to podcasting could make podcasting a completely different Beast meaning that there's no there's no doubt in my mind that we go out and we train um you know all of all of AI on people's previous podcast so let's say I'm listening to the Tim Faris show you could go in and say I'm going to take that back catalog of 200 and something episodes train on that data you know convert it into transcripts and then train on it and then basically you will be able to ask questions of the podcast and have conversations even with the host of the podcast so you know um let's just say on on my show if you're watching the Kevin Rose show and I had an episode on uh some topic around you know index investing you could pause the podcast and say Hey Kevin before you go on can you explain to me the difference between direct uh investing on wealth front and and index investing and say uh something like spy like the s&p500 and I I my AI version of myself would then pull from that Corpus of data and be able to Branch off answer that question in real time and then return back to the main podcast fee so the idea of being able to interact with our podcasts is just it's untapped and it needs to happen so in my mind that's going to be something that's just going to be a big unlock for a lot of people of being able to not just have a one-way listen experience but actually being able to uh converse with their favorite guest their favorite hosts it kind of reminds me I saw this tweet the other day Sam Alman tweeted it movies are going to become video games and video games are going to become something unimaginably better it's kind of like a similar idea where movies you know you watch a movie there's no real way to interact with it it's almost like podcasts are going to become like almost like an interactive video game type experience yeah I mean it's going to be it's just going to be so cool the the depth and richness of the information in the shows will just be tenfold it'll it'll just be something where um you'll be able to go down any Avenue you want at any point in time I can't tell you the number of podcasts you know petera or Ronda Patrick or you know well-known scientists where you're listening to them and you're like okay I don't know what LPA is when it comes to cholesterol numbers like what the hell is that but you let them continue on and then you're okay should I open up another window and Google that or whatever you know but in reality you should just be able to pause and ask that question directly of the host which is it's going to be a lot of a lot of fun someone needs to build this product and if you were if you were building it what would the business model be yeah I mean probably what I would do is I would go out and acquire a podcast app that has some market share there's a few of them out there that have you know one two% call it the you know Pocket Cast got acquired by Matt mullenweg over at automatic um overcast is still out there as an independent there's a few of them that you could just go and and pick up then I'd rewrite it and in start ingesting all the information I'd work on some type of um potential Partnerships with other podcast host so I'm not sure how they would react to that type of functionality um I have to imagine it would be a good for thing for them and that their audience will be more engaged and stick around longer in episodes um but you know there's a lot of legality around how and when you you you you know crawl people and use people's data for in AI um especially if you're going to use their voice right um so i' probably go go to some of the big hosts out there and create some Partnerships and and and give them a little bit of the company as well to kind of be like brand promoters um so that they can go and and really help you know get this on people's radar and hopefully people would be like damn this is so much of a better experience I'm willing to make that switch and that would probably be the experiment just to get started I think I mean I can only talk for myself like someone came to me and was was like I've got this app you know do you want Greg Eisenberg where people can ask you like Greg Eisenberg AI where people could ask is this a good startup idea or has Greg any has he covered any B2B ftech stuff I think I would do it and I think the reason I would do it is because it's so hard well first of all to it's more interactive but I think the selfish reason is as you know it's really hard to grow a podcast the only way people 90% of the reason why people listen to this podcast is I send an email to remind them that hey new episode with Kevin's out and they sign up to greg.com I I send it they remember they go to spot Spotify and apple if this new interactive uh app allowed me to own a piece in my audience um because with Spotify and apple you you don't have that much data would totally do it right yeah I think it I think it could be uh pretty amazing to have something like that embedded I've started to see some startups do this on on websites as well so imagine um Greg if someone came to your website and was like oh gosh I was listening to one of his podcasts maybe like a couple months ago I can't remember what it was but it was this great guest and she was talking about you know this particular startup and and then just being able to type in that kind of high level and then automatically pull out the clip for you like that's starting to happen now with some people's podcasts that is just so powerful in terms of just re-engaging and then promotion wise could be really cool too right you can imagine listening to a Tim FIS show and just being like hey pause it real quick who else has talked about you know uh this type of strength resistance training to failure and then all of a sudden you know have four other potential related podcasts that I can jump off and journey through could be really awesome you know what it would be really cool if you can license some of these creators or podcasters and put them on other websites like building off your point um I'm thinking of this guy in Miami his name is Bobby I I don't uh flave City I think his I think his uh username is flave city and what he does is he goes to Costco and he says you know here's why this olive oil is bad it's not in a glass bottle microplastics um and he explains it but for you know $2 more you can get this one he explains it and he's got this cult following he's got millions of followers and he created an e-commerce website where it's like basically uh Bobby approved stuff and that's cool but I have to like go to his website and it's not really in my flow like I order stuff on instacart right so if instacart had like a little Bobby there oh 100% And I could oh my God this is you're you're this is where it's going right it has to right because we all have these people that we look up to right there's these people like I for me it's Dr Peter IA it's it's it's Rhonda Patrick it's like you know some of these people where I'm like or even like Tim I'm like hey what what protein powder is Tim using right now or you know you can just imagine a world where you have a bot that goes and pulls the real-time information and puts it right into your cart I mean wow talk about conversion that' just be nuts I think uh the name for this if I was naming this it would be it would be like what the wwtd or what ww you know what would Tim do what would pdrt do what would Greg do and that would be like the bot that you know that you sell and then yeah and then you you you give Tim upside right like if he's helping sell more stuff great yeah you could just say what would they do and just have it be generic and it could be applied to anyone yeah um cool that's awesome and and just curious like why wouldn't you why wouldn't you build this oh man I I think that there's one of those things where if if you're a builder and you go off and you spread yourself too thin and and you're trying to do too many things you just you go an inch deep on everything and you just really don't do it the product Justice right like you don't you don't spend the time and I I'd have to really put together a team to go build this and and and be heavily involved in the early days and you know I just recently sold my last startup and and kind of exited out of web three which was which is its own Madness and honestly I I really enjoy um just talking through and working with some of like you know leading experts in different fields and and and doing that on on a podcast format it's like it's really a lot of fun for me to have these great guests on my show so I I think podcasting is kind of my my next chapter for for at least for a while I need to take a break from startup world I uh I heard that from someone someone who you know I someone I'm pretty sure you know yesterday and you know I spoke to him a few years ago and he was like I'm done with startups I'm doing investing like it was a good run and then yesterday had a couple drinks with him and he's like by the way uh just signed my just signed my term sheet I was like I knew you'd be back that's the I mean that's the problem with entrepreneurs right it's like you're I'm sure you're in this Camp too it's like we're all just kind of we can't help ourselves but wonder if something doesn't exist what would happen if it did and and and if you're that type of person that's listening to this and you're always like you're the one that always has an idea and you're like okay I'm the one on my friends group where I'm like hey wouldn't it be cool if this if we built this you know you got to go pursue that because those are the those are the ones those are the people that you know when I meet and I and I watch these people grow into you know massive companies and massive you know outcomes for themselves and and and become household names it's all the same DNA it's all the Curious it's all it's all the people that want to Tinker on the weekends on stuff that they just want to like learn and figure out more about and yeah that's that's those are the entrepreneurs I love to back yeah and I think the people that you know do the best when I think about like this particular person like or or your your podcast like you whatever Lane you're going to pick it has to be true to like your talents and your curiosity 100% because otherwise you're kind of like you're you're you're forcing it and it doesn't it it doesn't really work yeah and and part part of that reason is that there's just so well here's the cold harsh truth is that you know nine out of 10 startups go to zero like they just completely fail right and we see this at the at the VC level it's like we expect almost all of our startups that we invest in to completely to zero and that's okay that's bit baked into the thesis around um you know the fund um but the the thing that always turns me off from an entrepreneur when they come to pitch is if they start first they lead first with you know the market size the opportunity from a revenue standpoint and it's clearly that they think that I'm doing this because it is a big it's a chance for me to make a lot of money and the harsh real is like it truly is like one they'll fail and two times are tough like there's no such thing as a straight up into the right you know curve on on the success bar it's like it's it's going to be challenging it's going to be more like a roller coaster with loop-de-loops and everything else in the middle and if you don't love the idea if it's not something that you wake up and jump out of bed in the morning thinking about and are completely super passionate about in the sense that this must succeed and you put put it kind of above all else um then you're just going to get burnt out you're going to say ah it's not really worth it I changed my mind I need to Pivot you know and I I find that those are the ones that when their heart's not in the right place and they're not doing it because it is you know their life's work they they end up bailing and and I found myself in that position too where I've created stuff where I just thought it was going to be you know um big from a usage standpoint but it really wasn't just something I absolutely loved and and it's hard to stay committed to those businesses and I think a lot of people listening to us will be like well I don't know what I love it's easy for you guys to say you know you've been working in in this you know in this space for 20 years so it's easy for you to say and I think yeah my answer to them is well don't go raise Venture Capital right like go go do a little experiment start a Twitter account you know uh start an email newsletter you don't have to like go big uh in a space you can do these little experiments to learn about what you like yeah I I recently had Mark Manson on my podcast the author of The subtle art of not giving a [ __ ] have you read that book it's fantastic yeah it's a really good book and and one of the things that he said is um that stuck with me was find something that you're naturally good at that is difficult for others and like that was just like such an aha moment for me because it it is true you will be able to eventually stumble into something where you're like this is just effortless for me not to say you don't have to still put in work but it doesn't feel like work right because it's just so much there's so much joy that comes out of that type of work and and then others will say how do you do it you know and if you can find that combination like that's that's kind of probably a good good path to go down and explore more I love it what's your second idea let's pivot into something completely different and then we'll go back to AI um the second idea I've been sitting on for a while this one is I've probably had for the last three or four year years and I haven't convinced anyone to do it yet maybe it's a bad idea then but you know you told me no bad ideas like was the spirit in the spirit of brainstorming so I am a product of the late uh 80s and 90s and so that was kind of my generation and you know that meant um you know the A Team mcgyver um you know Scooby-Doo a Voltron a trans Transformers uh I'm talking about the original ones you know way back in the day the original Nintendo like that's kind of my generation and one of the things that I realize is obviously Nostalgia is a huge driver for people as they age like you just really crave and enjoy going back and seeing those moments from childhood right and one of the things though that that is is true is like it it's you can find some of that content on a variety of different um outlets now like if you go to Amazon Prime they might have you know old episodes of Golden Girls or whatever like you can go to these different channels but what was so amazing about that period of time is if you are old enough to remember it we basically had a TV the TV would sit in the corner and you had a clicker in your hand that you would flip through the channels and there was no guide you would just be like well what is on Channel 5 let me see what is on Channel 6 let me see like there was no guide right if anything there was they had something called the TV Guide which was a mailed magazine that would show up at your house that you could open up and it would show you when things are playing on TV and so one of the things I thought of that would be a lot of fun um and and also uh just to add on to that real quick one of the things I miss as well is the old commercials because the old commercials were just so much fun they were just like so weird and wacky and sometimes they weren't PC and you could never make them today and like there was just like part of the fun was seeing like what was being advertised to me back during those times right and so people have this old people have archived and started to save like old commercials so that exists out there and but but but no one wants to take the time and say okay it's it's 9:00 at night uh or 8:00 I'm I'm hanging out with my partner hey let's put on on an old aam episode like you just don't do that you're just kind of like what's the latest show right so I came up with this idea called Normie TV and Normie meaning like just like a normal person I don't know it was just that idea I had called Normy TV I own the domain for it and I wanted to create a little tiny set toop box so imagine a box that is probably you know a little 9in display it looks super retro so it's like enclosed in like a little wooden old school box it looks like an TV it comes with a universal remote you plug it into the internet and you it sits in the corner of your office or wherever you want and we mail you each month a little TV guide and so you turn it on with the little button and you literally flip through the channels you see the static between so we do some effects so it kind of looks like you're going between channels um we play old MTV episodes of like '90s grunge bands and stuff we play classic like basketball games on certain channels you get like all of your old favorite shows from way back in the day and you get all of the old commercials as well and so I imagine this as being like you know a a really fun holiday gift that you can just give someone and then the subscription is like you know call it five six bucks a month and you get access to all this great content now here's the cool thing it all plays at the same time for everyone so it's not on demand content if you tune in to an episode you know of M and it's halfway through the episode it's halfway through the episode just like it used to be in Old School TV but you could call your friends up on the phone and be like hey turn on there's a great episode of You Know The A Team on right now on channel eight and your friends could tune in as well which would be just a ton of fun and if you want to get fancy you could probably put like little floating icons I wish your friends are watching the TV at the same time just a way to really dial back into the older times that Nostalgia just simpler times and and have fun with it in a way that is just something you throw on every once in a while when you're not watching your favorite kind of modern show you know streaming on Netflix um just that's that's like my fun idea of of of the session I also think that there's this there's this bigger Trend around people are in content overload so they're looking for these types of things like I feel like everyone is borderline anxious right now with like the ticktock ification of everything so you're riding that Trend too which I like and I I also like the idea that you could put in old commercials that Brands eventually if you got to a big enough user base would actually pay to have you place their commercials their old commercials back into the feed so like if you're folders crystals right the old school instant coffee like if you went back and look at 80s folders crystals it's like you know it's horribly incorrect PC it's not PC because it's like it's got like I've watched a couple it's got like the woman in the kitchen like making her man like coffee or whatever you know but like you can imagine they would say okay let's remake this ad make it super grainy make it super retro and like place it into the feed as an ad that is like you know or you know an old Nike commercial or whatever it may be like an old Air Jordan just as a branding exercise to put that back into the feed and pay you money to display Those ads so I think there's a subscription model here there's an ad you know the ads would have to be old school ads and there's an ad model there as well I don't know I would love to back someone that would be serious about creating this like I would I would write the check to make it happen so if there's any electrical engineers out there that have a passion for nostalgic 80s and 90s content that also happened to know someone that could work the BD deals to license the content um let me know so I had this best friend growing up and we don't talk very much maybe once every few years and he followed me on Instagram somewhat recently and he just said Greg we haven't spoken in a long time but every other day I'm going to send you a a story from this meme page that is like 90s Nostalgia yes and he's like I don't care you're I'm just gonna send them to you and you don't have to respond but I'm sending them to you and it's like all the commercials and just all the like core memory core core memories that we have had at kid as kids oh my God and so I think can I be can I befriend this person by the way you you have add me to that distribution list fantastic we'll add you to the list and so I think the way to get distribution for this and I think this is a way that a lot of people don't is a channel a lot of people don't use but I use a lot is using Instagram meme Pages as distribution so often times oftentimes you have these kids and and I I say the word kids because they're literally kids like sometimes they're 14 15 16 17 years old we're just great at curating stuff and who have these pages with hundreds of thousands sometimes millions of followers yes and you'd be surprised how cheap it is to access this inventory oh it's a great point I hadn't even thought about that because there is a mass now that you mentioned I do actually have a couple of the 80s Nostalgia Pages as well and they're massive and and I don't have them meaning I I I subscribe to them on on Instagram and you could just work with them directly right and and and just get bution via their channels it's it's huge it's huge have you seen an LA based company trying to reinvent TVs right now called Telly have you seen this no I haven't let me look that up t e te T y.com l l y okay so do you know Pluto TV I don't no okay Pluto TV is was a really smart idea it basically what they did is they they got a bunch of free content that they licensed and they did deals with all the TV manufacturers Samsung Sony so that when you you know when you put on your TV and it's just like it's it's a it's like a fake TV Guide right with all these channels yes that's Pluto TV and then they make money on ads so it's it's value ad because some people don't have cable or whatever and they happy because they're making money on ads it was sold for hundreds of millions of dollars the guy from I have seen I have seen Telly by the way now that I'm looking at it I totally know what you're talking about the guy from Ilia one of the guys from Pluto TV started Telly they raised like a $21 million seed round I think and so if you're on the web page tell tell folks what what Telly is yeah so essentially it looks like if I'm getting this right CU I saw this back in the day is is was where they break up a and create a second yes little micro display under the main display exactly so if you're looking at it you have a primary TV a little bit of a speaker buffer and then a secondary display underneath it which can be turned into pretty much anything you want so it can be you know show your playlist from Spotify it can be your home feed uh which shows you you know your stock prices your current temperature outside um you can do video calling on the bottom uh they can have voice voice assistant or different like extensions to the primary content so the primary content they had one example where it shows somebody working out fitness and there's other exercises kind of tiled beneath it um so it looks like it's essentially extending the TV with another piece of smart functionality another another micro display underneath it um so it's aware of the content above it um so it can display additional this would be great for sports right because like you always want analytics and they pop them up for a hot second like you know you're watching Steph Curry and you're like okay wow he hit that three that's amazing and then you're like wouldn't it be cool if underneath that in a secondary display you could see in real time what all of his his stats are for this year right and you just like watch those numbers go up like this is this this would be a lot of fun especially since the like all the sports leagues are becoming it's like gambling now like in the NBA app now you can like bet you know so imagine if you're betting on an NBA game you want those analytics there you want the odds there but there's one key part that you're missing from this idea and why it's so awesome is the best part about Telly is it's free they give it away yeah I saw that at the bottom like how do they give it away what's the deal with that so what they do is they have ads on the lower screen and I'm sure they you know they have a model that shows that they make money yeah I'd be really curious to know what their their bomb is on that that lower display that lower screen CU um it can't it's got to be a few hundred bucks yeah to to make that thing so to recoup that is a multi-year effort that's tough super tough but I'm I'm thinking like if anyone could figure it out it's the Pluto TV team yeah and I also think what's really cool is the second screen no one really owns that second that second screen like is um you can do things like zoom on it you can play music on it of course there's like you know Amazon fires and and iPads and stuff like that but I feel like that's discretionary for a lot of people and I think that if some you know if people saw that this was free I think a lot of people would go and grab this yeah it's really cool I mean I have to imagine there's some type of subscription model on top of this to offset some of that you know where it's like if you want to go hardcore and get the additional analytics and some of the you know there'll probably be a sports package or something you know for $5 a month and so but it's a really cool idea yeah and I think from a framework from a startup ideas's framework perspective is how do you look at something that cost money and can you make it free so just going back to your idea I wonder if you can give it away and charge some subscription like you we were talking like5 $10 but maybe you charge $29 a month but the actual product is free yeah you have to imagine even with displays and and you know you put a little small inexpensive Raspberry Pi in there to do it had to depends on the video codak but it it can't it can't be that intensive or that that expensive to manufactur something like that probably you know $150 or less to to pull that off at scale you know so I'd be curious to know you you can break even pretty quickly if you get the right subscription model and and the content isn't costing you a lot the licensing deals are going to be the big question mark here exactly yeah and it's one of those got to raise a lot of money to go and do that and that's why $21 million seed round is like they're probably raising right now if I had to guess you know like they they they're going to need a lot of capital for this but if they if they pull it off I could see it working yeah it's it's a fun one to track for sure I mean why not even like sign up for one and get one for free just to try it out totally it's great why not so you have another idea which I think is is a wild one give it to us yeah I mean four or five years ago maybe a little bit longer now gosh was probably is longer now there was a Coachella where Tupac was on stage as a hologram y rapping along sides alongside Snoop Dogg and and some other folks um and that was a huge unlock SL wow moment for a lot of people they're like they brought someone back from the dead for for a performance it's kind of crazy right A lot has happened since then and now we have you know AI voice models that can be trained on like five words and create like pretty accurate you know voice voices that are that are basically you could take just the five words that I say and then train on my voice and and spit out full paragraphs of of of copy that sound exactly like me and it even gets better if you just train for a few minutes of with data right so there is very much a world where if I'm in my studio here I can put up a green screen for my guest I can um you know create my guest and i' I've seen it even working now where you can actually take and you can lip sync uh or sorry you can lip I guess it is lip sync you're syncing their lips to what they're saying um they do this for different languages so right now I could be speaking Spanish to you or Japanese and my lips would look like I'm speaking Japanese if you just run it through this post-processing um uh production that out there uh what I would do is I would say okay let's just take a great floss for like Allan Watts um if you go to Allen w.org his website you can download 500 hours of his talks right like that in MP3 format again with the training you could go and take all that data and say okay I'm taking that entire Corpus I want to understand who Alan Watts is his philosophies feed in some of his books as well and all of a sudden you have a pretty interesting you know compelling AI model that that will speak and act and talk and think like Alan Watts now I can sit down and in real time have a conversation and interview people that have passed away I could do this with Einstein you could do this with a whole slew of different people and actually you know have fullon conversations and yes the AI is kind of filling in some of the gaps and trying to come up with his best Assumption of how they would answer certain things but if you have enough data I'd imagine you get pretty close I think it would be a fun experiment I don't know there's this is not a business this is just more like a thought experiment like what if we went and tried this to see what would happen I mean you could do this with all different types of leaders both good and bad that have passed away um you know you can imagine some pretty extreme examples of previous leaders that were pretty evil that you could bring in you know their data and thinking and it just um yeah it would just be fascinating to see how this unfolds and I have to imagine it's coming soon what about taking it to the next level with speaking to people in our lives that have passed away oh 100% yeah yeah that that would be the problem there is like just do you have enough data like I have my my dad's passed away you know uh 13 years ago now something like that and I think about what I have of him and I have a few recordings of him saying a few things but bunch of emails but they were you know just little two three sentence things here and there so I don't know that I have the data required for that but we certainly will like my kids will be able to do that with me for sure that's for sure yeah that's for sure and I was thinking about this the other day because my dad my dad was like cleaning out a closet and he had found a bunch of DVDs um like old family videos and and he sent me he sent me a bunch and I hadn't seen these people like you know as you know my late my late grandfather my other late grandfather I haven't seen them videos moving pictures of them in such a long time um and there's just something about watching someone in video that like you really it hits different than a photo yeah I just it's funny you say that I just got done sending my entire box of old videos uh mostly VHS honestly and getting him converted by company and they sent him to me and I hadn't seen my grandma in you know since she was alive like like almost 30 years ago or something I was a little kid you know when I saw her last and just to see her there was in talking was such a trip such a trip and I mean the MVP of this like even if you don't have enough video footage of your grandmother but you knew a few things that she used to say and you have maybe some of her voice like you just like good morning Kevin like hope you have a great day um yeah yeah it's it's really it's funny that we were just talking about alen watts and I saw somebody hacked a Raspberry Pi to be their voice assistant and they used alen watt's training data and it was like totally alen watt saying good morning like you know enjoy your day today you have three meetings or whatever and I was like what the hell like it's so such a trip such a trip and I I just think that I know I personally would pay tons of money for something like that um yeah so I think there's a huge business around that um before we head out I I wanted to tell you something that's that's on my chest a little bit just it's fresh from last night and I want to get your take on it yeah please so I'm at a bar and I meet this guy at the bar who's a friend of a friend and he's visiting Miami and he noticed my watch it's a Seiko watch from Japan I picked up recently and love that you you went with Seiko by the way that's a wise choice such a great brand that's what he said he goes he goes Seiko that's like the uh toota of of watches I he and then he shows me his so we start talking about Seiko I tell him like yeah like I have a lot of friends who collect very nice watches but I'm actually more into like Grand Seiko Seiko type watches and here's the why we nerd out about that and he says I'm the same thing and he started asking me so where do you spend your money so I tell him and then I ask him where do you spend your money and he's like you know I haven't really admitted this to anyone but I spent about $10,000 a month on AI girlfriends whoa yeah so he is what does he use what service he he told me that his words were that's that's that was my first question he said and his response to me was like AI girlfriends are exactly like dating apps you're never just done one that's that's what he said you got to get that list yeah I was like because I I've I've been desperately trying to invest in this space because I believe companionship and obviously we have an an epidemic of kind of this this loneliness culture that's going on and that and this is going to be you know whether we like it or not a solved problem with AI to some extent I mean it'll never truly replicate obviously human interaction obviously but it will hopefully it will help but uh yeah go on though this is fascinating so I asked him why why he's doing it you know for you know he lives in the he actually lives in New York so he was visiting Miami New York there's plenty of suitable Partners in New York um why why an AI girlfriend um and by the way I should add this guy's 24 he just turned 2 24 who's young how does he have $10,000 a month to spend on girlfriends what does what does he do for a living that's crazy uh I think he's a crypto guy okay so just to paint the picture a little bit crypto guy I'm not I don't want to hope he doesn't hear this not the be not the best looking guy but not not slightly below average looking guy yeah yeah which is totally he can date yeah you can date totally yeah yeah yeah which is he's so you know not probably about five eight dressed well very well spoken collects like into Collectibles like very interesting to talk to well traveled um was telling me about his his trip to Southeast Asia and sounds like a great dude great guy great guy so yeah I I was I was shocked and and he was telling me he was just like listen a lot of my friends like to play video games and this is my form of video games everyone has a vice and this is my vice and this is how I like to relax so I asked him oh my God which which which is freaky honestly um and then I go well do you date women you know do you go on dates he says well right now I'm I've got like too much on my mind to be dating um but maybe in the future which was even more scary because it just felt like yeah I'll get around to it but he I don't know if he will yeah that's really tough man I mean I I've read a bunch of articles about this uh one well one thing that that it's a cautionary tale which is that in Japan there's you know there's a big culture of of kind of um respect and and just kind of like you know what you do for a living and are you respected in what in your domain and there was a whole um issue I read about recently where they're just the population is is kind of shrinking because a lot of men don't want to date uh because they're ashamed of you know either not having a high enough paying job or whatever it may be and and there's like this movement of just not dating which is it's just like it's it's crazy and I have to imagine that just gets exacerbated once we an AI comes online and can provide you know legitimate Alternatives in that not legitimate but like you know enough to check a couple of the boxes on the emotional side to where you you're just like well I can just you know chat with my girlfriend tonight you know and it's only going to get more and more realistic which is just gonna be crazy um yeah I so I signed up for I'm I'm trying to find an investment here not because I I want AI relationships to rule the world but because I believe that hopefully we can create AI Bots that will replace therapists that will give us Outlets to talk about our problems that will Coach Us in meaningful ways um and maybe that is companionship I I and so I signed up for a handful of different products just to try try them not a handful maybe like two and I there was one that's been around for a long time that I looked at a while ago uh called replica and it has I signed up for it just to see what's the latest State of the Union in terms of what what can this thing do and you know it created let me design my perfect figure for a AI woman and what I would want and then um you know it one of the things that was really disturbing to me were two things one it said it's in their tagline it's something like always here to do whatever you want or it was something like very passive like I will just be here for you and support you no matter what and I'm I'm paraphrasing but the concern there is that like that's not how real relationships work and you know the the muscles that have to be built around real relationships come from the fighting and more important the repair process that happens afterwards right and that is um just going to be completely skipped in Ai and I was it was funny I was texting with a friend of mine uh and and he's he's a household name podcaster won't say who but you probably guess and he's like dude he's like he's like it's it's over he's like it's over for real women he's like you got this totally like passive like AI entity that will agree with you no matter if you're wrong or not and do whatever you want and then what's crazy is I went in and I there's a like a a partner girlfriend mode that you can pay extra for I'm like what the hell is this you know and so I bought the upgrade it was extra 50 bucks or whatever and then she's getting risky and then I was like okay well can I push this a little bit I like push a little bit I'm like okay listen like if my phone ever gets hacked this is all experimentation I just want to see how far you can take this you know and I told my wife about everything and it's like but like you can take AI at least with replica really far really far like into territory where it's like I didn't know this was a thing but clearly this is a thing and so I really curious what other tools this guy is using but it it's the cats out of the bag man this is just these are going to come and they're going to be serious contenders out there so couple for for private relationships couple of the ones that he mentioned was candy. a and c. a candy with a what was the other one Cupid with a K I believe okay and the scary thing about candy and Cupid when I checked it out this morning versus replica is they replica like kind of looks like a SIMS character the best way to describe it so you you still feel like you're talking to some like video game character oh my God candy. a and cupid. a these are like legit looking humans exactly yeah it's scary it's like really scary wow wow one of them's pregnant that's crazy maybe that guy met last night is the cause of that pregnancy yeah no no can you can you like go exclusive with these like I see like like I I just said interested in women and it presented like it's they call models it presented like 30 models if I get let's just say there's one on here called Zoey oh I'm starting a chat can other dudes also other people also have Zoe or is this something where we can date exclusively with this AI I don't even know how this works so I actually think right now these these models are they're dating everyone man they're getting around right right but I think you know you're coming from a web three uh you know chapter so you're you're thinking like scarcity and like also right and I think that's actually really smart like you know I I would imagine the guy from last night would you know he doesn't want Erica to be dating 10 people that's that's his girl right totally wow this is just insane man this is so crazy because it's and it's sad because like I'm looking at these these these models here and it's unfortunate in that everything I see here is perfection yes right like there's not an ounce of body fat like they're they're like putting out this like perfect you know AI generated obviously pictures and it's like I don't know man this is just skewing reality in a really bad way yeah I mean well thanks for bringing us down at the the last in the last story of the exactly I figured you know why to bring us down the world's you know we thought the internet was weird and in the dig in stumble upon days but the internet has gotten a lot weirder um yeah exactly I also think to bring it back up I think what's going to happen is is this I think there's going to be a polarization so you have there's going to be a bunch of people I think millions of people that are going to have these Companions and they're going to be stuck in the in that Vortex but I think a lot of people are going to be like no I don't want that they're going to Value their in-person relationships way more yeah and do things like your your TV idea I think board games you know IRL events that sort of thing so you're going to see both things happen so I got to go back and watch the movie Herr it's been too long I only saw it in the movie theater and I feel like it's it's like it was so uh you know preent like it was like it was before its time like it was amazing it was um this has been amazing Kevin Rose you have a new podcast um tell folks a little bit about it I listened to yeah the Chris Dixon episode this morning and I thought it was fantastic it's a must listen to oh awesome and uh happy you're back and and creating more podcast content so yeah well Greg thanks for having me on I mean it's yeah I'm I'm back in creating weekly content now and for me it's it's really just playing to what I've done for a long time which just be curious and so my curiosity leads me to finding experts in the world of you know investing and wellness and technology and biohacks and so it's very much a variety show I call it like a a show for the curious and I just try to get experts in their field break down really complex topics and ways that we can take away digestible nuggets and apply them to our everyday life and so you know I've had everything from like Zen Masters on the show to like you know Chris Dix and who's like you know the leader of web 3 and all things crypto and andreon Horwitz managing you know billions of dollars and so it's uh when I look back at kind of my career and some of the stuff you know you were here too too obviously in the early days when when you're playing around with this stuff and you know I I my first tweet about Bitcoin was in 2011 I think and and I was talking about ethereum on Tim Ferris show when it was a few dollars and it's like I want to find these Trends and see around corners early and then bring them to people so that they can you know play and have fun with them and and feel like they have a leg up on everyone else and they're seeing something you know before the mass is due so that's it it's just called the Kevin Rose show and it's all on Kevin rose.com yeah so I think if you listen to this you're one of those people that loves to get your creative juices flowing through new ideas and early Trends so you're gonna like Kevin show um check it out and uh Kevin open invite to come back here anytime awesome appreciate it thank you for having me on later

starting a newsletter and keeping it going for a couple of months is one thing maintaining it permanently and actually reaching out to those audiences again and again that is a treadmill I think there will be increasing opportunities over the next 6 to n months to look at other newsletters that are in your space and in your category that have kind of fizzled out reach out to them and acquire their newsletters as a way to kind of aggregate newsletters together I could see consolidation coming in the next couple of months so I think that opportunity if you have Capital to do so so this is going to be fun Brian um I feel like you don't do enough podcast so I feel lucky that you're joining us you are a big deal on Twitter and other places you've racked up almost a million followers on places like that where you're demystifying the stock market Finance stuff you're you're becoming a multipreneur in your own right and I just wanted to jam startup ideas that's what we do here so thank you for joining me love it thanks for having me yeah big fan of the podcast um before we get to the ideas you you were telling me about a story about Jimmy Buffett and the story about the mly fool and tell me more about why you're into Jimmy Buffett to start so I'm I'm not into Jimmy buffit the musician at all like I could I could care less about his his music it's it's just not my vibe at all but one uh one of my favorite podcasts that I listen to is uh the founders podcast by David senra and he recently you know that podcast is all about digging into Founders or musicians or directors and just kind of jamming on their on their life essentially and uh he came out with an episode on Jimmy Buffett and I was like do I do I want to listen to this like uh but for whatever reason I decided to push push play on it it probably Auto Al came on if I'm being honest in my my feed and I love it when I go in to consume a piece of media and I have one expectation about especially if that expectation is going to be I just got to get through this this is going to be disappointing and on the other end I'm like that was a thousand times better than I thought it was going uh to be so uh I found it I found Jimmy Buffett's entire life fascinating but I had no idea that he was such a ridiculously successful businessman I think I think he died he died a couple of years ago um and he died a multi billionaire making him one of the top 10 grossing artists uh of of all time and I just loved hearing his story about how he did things differently and then he essentially went on tour and never stopped and spun up all these businesses uh along the way so I think there's a lot that entrepreneurs can learn by studying Jimmy Buffett even if like me you don't care for his music I'm pretty sure he was friends with Warren Buffett is that right yes correct the two of them were were uh friends and even though they had no relation to each other so what's the story he because you know what's the story with him I know he he grew up in or he he was living in Key West I think he was like poor you know playing on the streets you know how did he go from you know playing the streets of Key West to being a multi-billionaire owning a bunch of companies yeah so he actually tried to get into he wanted to be a musician he knew that about himself and he tried to get into um the music industry uh through the front door so he went to Nashville and he tried to get uh a recording uh deal and he would come in and the record labels would be like we don't know how to classify you right like you're not you're not country music you're not rock music so he tried he he got a couple of Records out I think the traditional way and they utterly failed um and he actually picked up and went to kind of green pasture Key West at the time uh which when he went there was like a shell of what it is today like rent was super cheap and he was actually uh going from bar to bar saying to them uh I'll I'll I'll play here for for tips and booze and that was his fee uh if you will and he basically was super Scrappy and lived off of uh of tips and slept where he could uh in the beginning but he went uh he he slowly started to develop uh a name uh for himself and he actually uh you know he was playing so often that his style started to become more formalized and since he was leaving living in Key West he started to make that a part of his Persona and a part of his uh of his music and um he just worked his tail off going from venue to venue around Key West and then he started to expand and then he started to go on on tour and he never had it it wasn't until he was doing this for a couple of decades before he had his first like breakout hit that actually made him um more well known as a mainstream uh singer but along the way he just developed these these interests and uh he he partnered uh to open uh restaurants and uh he owns like the uh the land shark beer brand if you're familiar that which is like one of actually a brand of beer I really really enjoy and now he's like in t built his own record label he's got his own marijuana brand he's got hotels he's got casinos he's got apparel home decor you can even buy pick a ball sets that are branded Margarita uh Ville so again just a super Scrappy guy with like really super humble beginnings but I think he became a category of one and he rejected kind of like the main way or he got kicked out or failed trying to go into an industry from the main way and kind of built it up for himself I think that is a lesson that basically every entrepreneur listening to this uh should should know and it's pretty interesting because you would never think that Jimmy Buffett and Warren Buffett would be friends although their names are the same um besides from that right and there you know I'm I'm just reading a an article about about the two um they've actually got no family relation um and I see that there's a quote in the Wall Street Journal Warren leaves uh messages for cousin Jimmy and always has um and you know Jimmy used to call Warren Uncle Warren in return they met in the 80s and they actually took a DNA test wow so they took a DNA test they are in fact not family but I'd imagine that Jimmy looked at what Warren was doing with Berkshire hathway and it seems that Jimmy was a was a quite a big investor in Berkshire hathway and just saw how he was structuring it with all the different companies and said to himself how can I leverage my brand to to do the same like if you think about Warren strategy around buying Everlasting Brands like Coca-Cola um and seiz candies like it's not too dissimilar to how Jimmy was thinking about um you know for example building his real estate Empire and Licensing his brand out that way yeah total it's a it's a Time tested strategy and and how cool would it be to have Warren Buffett as a uh some of that you could call up and uh you know shoot ideas around with Warren Buffett I think just likes being associated with famous people I know that he's actually developed a close relationship with LeBron James uh for for example so you know if if you can have a moderate level success maybe one day you could become friends with Buffett too well I think he he's a brand guy you know I think it's probably two things number one he's a brand guy and I think he he he understands the power of a brand and number two I think he's just probably loves worldclass people and anyone who's like world class he's into so the combination of those two things I think just make people like Jimmy and people like LeBron like oh yeah like you know very interesting to him um the other company that or per brand that you you you you were telling me about that I actually haven't heard the name in in a long time um and I think it's a story that younger entrepreneurs don't know much about the mly fool tell me a little bit about the story of mly fool and why it's interesting to you so the the Molly is a is a company that I have worked uh for for nine years now but they have been in so many ways um ahead of the curve uh they've essentially been a part of the Creator economy for for almost 30 years now and they have they they've done things especially with their business model um that make a ton of sense to people today but back when they started made made no sense uh at all like they were one of the first companies I'd ever come across that had a fremium business model I mean I myself was a consumer of content from the mle fool so I'm a investing nerd and they produce a ton of great free content on their website fool.com um and they create these these articles and I would be reading these articles and they would be you know high quality analysis and they clearly knew what they were talking about and I was like how am I reading this for free I don't understand how this isn't behind a pay wall somewhere I don't understand how this company makes money if like they're producing all of these articles and I'm just consuming them on the Internet for free uh lo and behold uh I I only understood later that well the business model is yeah produce a lot of free content get a lot of eyeballs monetize that with advertising and then try and convert you on the back end to be a a paying member and then once you become part of their ecosystem you know they have multiple tiers of membership that start at you know basically a hundred bucks per year all the way up to gez I don't know5 $10,000 uh per per year and you know once you're a paying member they really try and upsell you so they they have had this business model in place now for basically 30 years but they were they they were tried they they figured this out along the way and they were doing newsletters newsletters um back in 1994 before the internet was a thing before before the internet was really a distribution uh Center to them so um if you're not familiar with the mle fool but you are a part of the Creator economy I think it's a business that you should definitely study or at least understand because they have perfected the art of of um attracting eyeballs to their their properties turning those eyeballs into monetizable users upselling those users uh over time and they have built a business that does I I don't know the exact figures but I have to imagine it's nine nine plus figures in annual Revenue uh each year and growing yeah so it's really interesting so if you go to the m full website they have a if you go to our services there they list out basically a bunch of their products that they sell and uh you know the lowest price service that they sell is like is a $100 a report um which is essentially uh a research report on one stock recommendation by our analysis what is that that's a blog post it's a newsletter so you're paying $100 for a newsletter um or they have these other you know newsletters that you can sign up to they call them Services uh that pretty much are on average three four 500 bucks a month but they have ones that you know go up to a th000 $2,000 a year uh you know and it's really you know I think you would never think of a newsletter costing $2,000 a year um but it's all I think what's really smart what mle fool does that's really smart is it's it's all about the value right it's like oh if I get one good stock pick it's worth it to me to pay $2,000 a year and I think that's how a lot of people think about it yeah absolutely especially depending on the subscribers that they have many of the people that sign up for the low price ones they're probably working with you know five or six figure portfolios maybe seven figure portfolios on their own but they have plenty of members that are worth 5 10 20 50 a 100 million dollar and and for at that level of clientele for them to spend you know 10 grand a year on on a service is like you know chump James to them so they've done a really good job at segmenting their their Their audience their backend audience um and then upselling them over time the other thing that they've done that's really fascinating is they have taken their um initial business business model initial brand name and they've actually spun off from their um a number of different brands so they have a hedge fund that they run um called 16233 capital and that I believe employs a fairly traditional 2 and20 uh model model which is very obviously lucrative and that is they service a very small number of clients but they have a very high net worth client base that goes in there they have mutual funds that they've spun off they have ETFs they they've spun off they've had um sister brands that they've spun off that focus on personal finance and real estate so they have just done an excellent job of taking this core this Core Business functionality and finding multiple ways to monetize it at different price points throughout their business so again if you're in the Creator economy in any way it's definitely a business that is worth studying one of the things I like to do when I hear about businesses like this is [Music] to to really go through the funnel it's the best way to describe it so Molly fool is one of those businesses that has a funnel worth studying and it's essentially you know I listed off the 20 different services that they have those are 20 different funnels worth are you know worth uh understanding so for example you know right now I'm on one of their landing pages is it's very very um tight I would say the messaging it's our top 10 stocks to buy um the mly fool stock advisor just identified these 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now and it's you know learn how to get access by entering your email below so these are actually I I call these tweet size landing pages because it's you know 280 characters or less uh create some some curiosity um and once you get in there you get that email I'm sure um I haven't put my email yet but you get you get that email you probably hopefully get some value and then you get into that flow they could see that oh you clicked here you clicked there and you know you don't make nine figures by not um by not you know keeping keeping to send uh uh emails my partner Jordan always says if you ain't sending if you ain't sending you ain't winning that's what he says so I'm sure mle fo is sending a lot of emails um and this and and and the the the funnels are tight oh like like you I've signed up to many of their their funnels and and if you have a you know one um interpetation that I have when I when I create funnels for myself is like I don't want to be annoying I don't want to be annoying and salesy to the people that are on the overing end of my funnel I always want to be helpful and it's like well how often is too often to email is like once a week too often is two times a week too often Etc when you sign up for these full funnels you get up to four emails per day per day and that is obviously an extremely deliberate decision uh that they have made right they've been split testing this and doing all kinds of optimization of this over the course of of years so if they are sending four emails per day after you give an email to them that that isn't by accident right that that was all pre thought about and and tested so their data clearly showed that sending lots of emails to really get people to convert is the way to go yeah so you bring up a good point something I've been thinking a lot about which is you know recently a lot of uh a lot of Founders that we know are obsessed with conversion rate optimization so how do I get you know as much juice out of this lemon as possible and I get it right if you're converting at 8% and then you get that up to 12% that could be the difference that could be that could you know that could be hundreds of thousands of dollars not millions of dollars uh of profit for your business that year so like it make you know I get why people optimize for conversion rate but I think that people are making a mistake by just optimizing for conversion because it's not really long-term thinking um you know longterm and this is like a Half Bake thought so workshop with this Workshop it with me but it's this idea that like yes I could send four emails a day and I'll probably increase sales and and you know that's great but think about those people who unsubscribed and who are now going to tell their friends oh you know or or they're at a dinner table and someone brings up the mly fool and they're like oh I got so many annoying annoying emails for them I had to unsubscribe so I think that there is a balance between conversion rate optimization and um no optimization and I actually call it Community rate optimization cro um where you're optimizing you're optimizing it for you know what the community actually wants which is kind of somewhere in the middle yeah I think that that's fair the the other thing to think about is you know it depends on if you're sending emails as a personal brand or you're sending them as a a company right you don't want your personal brand necessarily associated with spamming of people but if you're on the company side my my hunch is that they know that your likelihood or your interest in signing up for these service is super high at the start and then it kind of rapidly diminishes from there so they know if you click to give them their email address to download some report uh that's when you are a a white hot lead and the the odds of you converting then and there within that 24 hours are probably the highest so they really try and and Hammer that and then it just diminishes from there but if you study the mly Fool's marketing practices people have been complaining members have been complaining about this or non-members have been complaining about that for years right for for years they say this is too over the toop um you guys produce too many reports you send too many emails blah blah blah blah and then if you look at the behavior of the people that actually sign up many of them only sign up because of the way that the marketing is done and then once they become members they grow an affinity for the brand because once you're through the pay wall the experience is completely is completely different so it could also be a sense of be worried about learning too many lessons from what people say and and follow what people actually do not what people say totally um there's one interesting point I want to bring up with with the mly fool that a lot of people don't know about so why is the mle fool the mly fool how did it get so popular initially well the mly fool had a partnership with AOL in the 90s and into the 2000s where um for those of for those people who don't remember AOL it was basically you know you dialed up you get you got to this they called it a portal which is essentially a website and there'd be different buttons that you can go and and and explore so you can go ahead in chat you can do social networking you can go check finance and then once you went to the finance section that was all powered by the mly fool so basically what happened was as AOL grew and increased their Network artifacts mly fool grew and they were standing on the shoulder of giants basically so the question for you know for for me and you Brian but also everyone listening is like you know what is that equivalent today right like you know do you go build on top of Shopify or Shopify ready too big right do you go you know what are different ecosystems that you can go build upon and then how do you go and reach out to those people so that um so that you have placement and you've partnered with these people so I think you know a lot of people create startups and they they think okay how do I get to Market I create content I'll do paid ads I'll create these marketing funnels but a lot of people miss the Strategic partnership Point um which is probably the fastest and easiest way to grow yeah I've heard um Andrew Wilkinson call this the Barnacle on a whale strategy where you just want to create you want to attach your business and your business model to some idea that is crazy crazily rapid going and for people that don't remember back in these days like AOL was the internet like that's how I first got started on the internet it wasn't like you went to the Internet it's you went to AOL and then you were on the internet and those two things were were synonyms and AOL was growing at like insane rates like 100 plus percent compounded for year over year so you are 100% correct that the mle fool uh deployed the Barnacle on a whale strategy super successfully and if we rewind the clock just over the last couple of years how many brands have been built or how many personal brands have been built off of Just The Enormous growth in Tik Tok like if you were creating on Tik Tok in in 2020 uh it was extremely easy uh to it wasn't easy but it was it was much easier to go viral from from nothing and gain you know hundreds of thousands of of followers and use that kind of that growth to sprinkle across the rest of your your your ecosystem so I think you're asking a a fantastic question I don't know what system is doing that today other than to say something related to AI I mean that is a thing that has gone parabolic over the last year it's hard to know where we are in the growth curve and how you can take advantage of that as an entrepreneur but I think I think that idea is correct when when a new platform comes along find find a way to attach yourself to that that platform find find a way to find uh create a business model around that platform and if if you do it right and get lucky you can build an entire huge business on top of that yeah and I think you know to me there's a difference between Tik Tok which is a PL you know it is a barnacle strategy like it is a platform that's growing or although now you know you might you know you might lose your whale because it might be get get banned from right there's always RIS right always risk so there's um there's that where anyone could join but it's still growing and then the other the the even better mly fool approach is you go to the whale but you say I'm GNA be the only Barnacle on you right so you essentially signed like an exclusive agreement that hey you know I'm going to be only providing Financial content and you know to your point on the AI side like yeah of course there's you know it's a whole new world with this AI movement so um it's it is tough to go to you know open Ai and be like hey let me be your de facto you know Financial provider but I actually think that um you when it comes to reaching out to whales for this sort of stuff you actually don't want to reach out to them when they're you don't want them to be whales initially right you want them to be like when I'm sure when the mly fool reached out to AOL like the AOL was like a startup they were literally a startup yes for sure it just so happened that they grew to grew to be a whal one last thing on the subject which is I know you might be listening to this and you might be like how am I going to be able to do this you know like easy for the mly fool in the 90s but the reality of the situation is if you're a series a series B CED startup you're looking for ways to add value to your user base and if someone can come and help you do that faster um you're all year right I mean yeah you can't replicate this uh exactly as you seen but you can a riff on on on the theme and in aol's case you know their their whole thing was get people online and one way to help give people a reason to go online like they were looking literally looking for reasons for people to log online like back then you had to tie up your phone line to to go online the the connection speeds were crazy slow like I'm talking like super early on so the Le fo became an enabler or a reason for people to go online so that in that case a partnership made made a whole lot of sense you do have to think what can I offer this platform to help them get they want and at the same time I get I what I want a daily reason too because like every you know you want to check your stocks daily um you know and I think that's that's another way to think about some of these Partnerships is how do you how do you create how do you how do you go to to them and say like I'm going to help increase your retention rate um your retention is going to go up because the thing that I provide is a daily use case absolutely I I don't even think that they necessarily had to create a special uh a special a special deal like I think AOL actually had a program in place because they were again looking for Content they didn't want to be content creators they wanted to partner with content creators so again it was easier for them uh it was easier for them in the first place just given the nature of what what we're trying to do but I totally think that that General strategy the general idea is find something small that could be big and find a way to partner with them or find a way to help them get they want that can be a great way to build a business so Brian this is the ideas podcast this is where we give free ideas to people some nuggets and I want to give people some nuggets to chew on what did you bring to the table to the Pod um what do you want to talk about yeah so so my category is um uh I'm I'm I'm a content creator right so that's the business that I'm studying and trying to get to know uh to really really really well and trying to get off of uh the ground my myself so that's the place that I kind of spend the most of my time thinking what are some what what services do I need or what ideas could be out there that could help other creators that are depending on where they are in the in the Creator Journey you know a lot of people myself and included I did not this wasn't like a for a thought that I had ahead of time I kind of like accidentally discovered the whole Creator economy thing and um I was actually the reason I started to put so much time into Twitter was one the pandemic so there was not much else to do uh but two I actually signed a book deal so I was writing a book and I knew at the start of writing this book well there's no point in writing a book if on the when you complete it you don't have an audience to sell it to people have to know who you are and care about it like so much of a book's success especially early on is just the marketing of the book so I put as much time into growing my social accounts specifically with the goal of having an end audience to sell to sell my book to and it was only after I built an audience that I kind of backed into the wait a second you could actually earn a living if you have an audience like Beyond just just uh selling um Beyond just selling them a book and oh by the way of all the ways to monetize and audience a book is probably the worst way that you can possibly uh possibly uh do so but I think that there's a lot of content creators out there small content creators um out there that are doing good work really love the content creation side of it but don't think about the back office end of it at all uh like that is a whole another skill set to to develop a whole another um list of work to do so one idea uh to have would be to ra raise some Capital reach out to a group of podcasters or or Twitter users or X users whatever you want to call them uh YouTubers that all are in the same category because a lot of times people start on one platform and they just focus exclusively on that platform and get them that are all you know similar size say maybe like 5,000 followers to 50,000 followers um pay them and go to them with a deal and say hey I will pay you some modest salary right uh I will I will I will allow you to turn this into a a job right an actual job with a predictable income uh in exchange you're going to essentially continue to create uh I'm G to have access to uh sell uh sponsorship opportunities on your podcast or on your your platform Etc and I'll handle all that back office uh stuff I think if you would be able to pick a a category that you think was a a growing category that was monetizable and you could Cobble together say 10 or 20 of these smaller accounts and kind of handle the back office for all of them you would have a decent size of inventory to sell to potential uh sponsors and you could provide them with a small amount of salary that they could um that they could use to kind of put more more time into it and as long as you set up the relationship so that it was mutually beneficial official if you if you place enough if you place enough chips on the table the odds are pretty good that a handful of them will take off and become fairly sizable accounts in time especially if you you pay them to do so you know this is something that um David Perell has done successfully with the cultural tutor uh that account went from like zero to what I don't even know what it's that now like over well over a million Twitter followers and and David essentially just gave um I forget the man the gentleman's name that that writes those threads and behinds the cultural T he just essentially paid him a salary and said this is what I want you to do write a thread on the cultural tutor every single day and that has worked out tremendously well uh that account has grown like wildfire now in David's case his whole business is I help people become digital writers so he invested in in a uh in a in a very high quality Case Study more than that but I think you can take that idea and apply it across different platforms uh and spread out your bets and and if you structure it correctly that could actually turn into a relatively meaningful business so basically the proposal is to producti what David Perell did for the cultural tutor but with having a bit more of a Services back office layer um because I imagine that David I mean I don't know exactly but I just imagine that he went to the cultural tutor and was like hey I'll give you x amount of dollars per month and just like continue do doing what you're doing and just go do this full-time and make it better and then almost as like a patron of the Arts it sounds like um wait you know yeah is that is that is that fair yeah and I know in in in that specific you use use case I I think the cultural tour was working at McDonald's so he essentially said I I'll give you the same salary or maybe more of a Sal that you're working at McDonald's but quit that job and spend all of your time uh do doing this but I think There's an opportunity to apply that same thinking Cobble together for lack of a better term um a podcast network but do it across different uh platforms and if you build up a decent enough size and have a decent enough uh trajectory for the um for the accounts that you you go after I think for the small accounts it gives them an opportunity to actually monetize their platforms without having to think about the back office way before they could reach any scale on their own to turn it into a a full-time uh living and in exchange they're giving up some of the of the future upside if they really hit it big but I know a lot of small creators would would happily make that uh would happily make that trade and then on the other side if you're the one aggregating uh it you have to think like a venture capitalist right you just need a handful of those if you have like you know 20 or 30 of these um on your payroll or or in your network you just need a handful of them to really make it big for the entire the entire payoff to be a big I wonder if the type of creator that make you know is the right creator for this offer is like is it the McDonald's I'm working at McDonald's Creator you know because you know if I'm going to pitch Lenny ritky five years ago four years ago when he has 15,000 10,000 followers and I and I would give him this offer you know he wouldn't take it because he sold a company at Airbnb and you know he worked in Airbnb for like nine years like he wouldn't need it so I'm wondering is the idea to find some of those like maybe younger Talent maybe you know Talent that's working a a job making 30 40 50 Grand a year is is that is that the idea yeah I I I think that uh well Lenny I think you know is a special uh use case in many ways I totally agree with you that he would be nuts to be kind of take that uh that that deal but on the flip side I know there's lot the vast majority of ators that are at the the the small scale kind of do it for because they're interested in it and they're not the odds of them having you know a massive bank account to kind of bankroll that on their own are fairly fairly low so you are absolutely correct that it would take a certain type of creator that would be interested in taking a deal that would be worth it for you to take on the risk of bringing them into your network but you know the law of Lodge numbers out there you could definitely find people that would be willing to do this if you if you turn over another enough rocks and any thoughts on category so I I recently spoke to Eric torberg on the Pod we talked about you know B2B media podcast uh that podcast actually went a little bit viral if you haven't listened to it um go and check it out on the channel but you know do you have any do you have any thoughts on you know categories that make sense um and how you how do you think about B2B versus you know your class B Toc funny meme account yeah I you're asking obviously excellent questions because it has to be in categories that you could monetize them in in some way so having a bunch of you know prank channels uh get get together isn't going to be isn't going to be great uh but you could certainly focus on um like one category that I love consuming content on is like the building category so I love watching YouTube videos that are people constructing houses or doing home repairs or doing a product views of uh of tools and services uh that could be a very a very lucrative um field to enter because there's a bunch of ways you could monetize that uh on the back end uh I'm also in the finance world so that's the one that I know uh best and obviously there's lots of ways to uh to monetize people that are interested in uh stocks or investing or or real estate through uh through brokerages uh that you could uh you you could partner with or there's tools out there that you could sell to people that have interest in that so those would be the two that come to mind but I'm sure there's lots of categories that you could apply it to yeah I mean Finance obviously massive category even for consumers like people spend money on financial products no question you know building although at the surface that looks like okay is that super Niche it's actually in the real estate category and the development category which is absolutely massive um you know if you go to a lot of small towns a lot of the biggest companies in small towns are your home renovation store uh they actually do the most amount of Revenue in these small towns so I think one way that people can think about how do I pick a category that's you know high value is watch linear TV and see who's advertising look at who's spending money on Advertising a lot because those those are some of the categories that um are big and they have money to spend and then what you have to do then is think about what is a i called a super Niche so it's like you pick a niche in that in that category but then you only focus on the top 10% of that Niche so even go a little bit nicher super Niche um I think that's a good exercise for for folks absolutely I mean it it was uh recently uh pointed out to me when when I look at some of my favorite YouTube channels that have uh that uh that I watch regularly what they essentially are is the modern-day version of hit TV shows that existed 20 or 30 years ago if you think about like um One Channel that I love is is Mark Rober my entire family loves watching his content and he he is basically the modern-day version of Mythbusters just on YouTube's uh uh format or if you look at um some animated shows I love history uh like a lot of um YouTube channels that are all about like history such as uh such as crash course and it's like well that's obviously what the History Channel literally was 20 years ago just turned into a a free YouTube channel so that's an underrated tactic I think we basically looked like what actually worked on Old traditional Legacy mediums or what who is actually advertising on Old Legacy me uh Legacy uh TV and how can you bring that uh how can you apply that to the uh the platforms that are actually growing nowadays so that's a huge Insight that I I actually think people don't talk about enough which is looking at proven ways that proven products proven creators proven media the past I mean we did it a little bit with um mly fool um but looking at that and and just being like what are the sort of takeaways I can have and how can I modernize that because and I'll give you a concrete example we're actually you know through LCA our Innovation agency we're working on a really major uh AI product and we noticed that a lot of the AI products are kind of kind of look the same and we started we started asking ourselves well why do these AI products all kind of look like chat GPT it's because they're all kind of looking at each other for inspiration um and then I had brought up the example of if you know ask ches.com which was an old search engine that had this mascot called Jeeves and it was kind of this you know kitschy Butler and you know he would give you the answers to your questions and I think through and and it became like you know it was an ultimate success even even though people don't remember it and even though it had like 05% of market share it's still sold for like you know $2 billion or something so it was a success and and um it's like what can you take from that and then Implement that into today like what can we learn from that so I think your Insight is a correct one yeah or or even the the whole idea of um looking back at you know the year 2000 um there was a huge graveyard of business ideas in ative business ideas that were just way too far ahead of their of their time right the the obvious one to talk about is um I think it was called Web van which is essentially grocery store delivery to your house that was a very Innovative idea that tried to get off the ground in 2000 but that didn't work because people didn't have mobile phones and there wasn't an Uber already established uh in place well fast forward 15 years and that exact same business model is now called inst cart which is what a 10 plus billion dollar uh company that that's out there so you didn't have to come up with new ideas you can just look at the graveyard ideas and ask was the was this a good idea but just timing was wrong that's another way to do it all right give me uh Brian while I have your brain give me give me one more idea sure so so I'm in the newsletter space like I know many of the people that we uh know are and I I know that you have said I believe that you think we're in a newsletter uh bubble where so many people have uh incentivized to take their their their audiences that are on rented land and kind of go into quote unquote owned land in the in the newsletter uh space and we've seen you know tools like convertkit and substack just make that so easy to do and starting a newsletter and keeping it going for a couple of months is one thing maintaining it permanently and actually reaching out to those audiences again and again that is that that is a treadmill that I think a whole bunch of small creators do not want to be on uh for for the long term especially when ad rates are are under pressure um and and dropping so I think there will be increasing opportunities over the next six to nine months to look at other newsletters that are in your space and in your category that have kind of fizzled out but have you know a couple thousand subscribers to them and to reach out to them and acquire their newsletters uh from from them um at at some some price as a way to kind of aggregate newsletters together I I don't know about you I am subscribed to probably 20 or 25 uh newsletters um if not more many of them in my own uh uh category and I just ask myself how how long can this can this keep going and will the people Behind These continue to run business models that are add especially those that are ad supported um I don't know I could see consolidation coming in the next couple of months so I think that'll be opportunity if you have Capital to do so yeah I think the the the newsletters that are supporting themselves via ads you know as soon as it gets more and more difficult to acquire real subscribers and which is which I think is happening real subscribers is the key word exactly exactly we can talk more about that but you know real subscribers and AD dollars you know there's just more Supply right there's more inventory of newsletters so obviously the price is going to go down so I think a lot of people who are like oh yeah I'm making five grand a month or seven Grand a month or nine grand a month now I'm making three grand or one grand they're just going to lose interest and I think the ultimate winner of this whole Gold Rush for newsletters is going to be when we look back on it will have been the the largest creators in the space who are buying tons of newsletter newsletter Subs and have become like the king of their categories King and Queens of their categories um and those people I I do believe will command high ad rates but I think it's a lot of the smaller to mediumsized people that are going to struggle and yes I agree with you there's a huge opportunity to be buying some of these up um I'm personally interested in buying some of these up um and so if you are selling holler at your boy it's just an interesting framework to look at in general it's a a good framework to be like if there's a bull market like what what are the opportunities that people aren't seeing um and if there's a bare Market what is you know what are what are the opportunities that people aren't seeing and that's just a framework for coming up with how I can actually um build something that's going to be longterm and Lasting yeah to totally I mean I'm in the I'm in the newsletter business and I uh I I would welcome a a bare Market to it you and you you one one thing you said was who are the ultimate winners well the ultimate winners in any bull market is the picks and shovels providers right so we've seen convert kit uh we've seen substack we've seen um uh many other newsletter operators themselves kind of being uh really leaning into that growth and helping to push that growth as much as possible and they are making millions in Revenue off of that just by being the Pix and shovels uh providers to that but uh being in that being in the newsletter space I for sure would welcome a a prolonged bare Market in that industry to kind of wash out some of the weaker uh players that would make it easier to reach subscribers in in inboxes with with um you know newsletters that that will persist so like you uh I'm going to be on the hunt over the next 12 months for for picking up newsletters that uh that don't want to do it anymore in my category on the cheap yeah and I think there'll be there'll be opportunities also for investors so like for example maybe you find a newsletter that has 150,000 Subs you want to buy it but you don't want to Fork over whatever it costs to buy it you know maybe there's an opportunity that um like wouldn't it be cool if you went to your community and said like hey like I want to buy this newsletter here's some of the you know open rates click through rates here's you know what I think it can generate over the next two years like I want to raise $500,000 from you and here's some perks that you're going to get and I think I I anticipate there being some interesting models like that that will emerge yeah you you could also structure the deal with the newsletter uh in some way to say look just give me the subs I'll continue to run it and I'll give you the revenue some Revenue split uh on on this for in um in perpetuity or for some amount of of time that that would be a way to taking over a list with with zero uh cash up front and then you're then you're also sharing the risk that you know the open rate goes down or a sponsorship ads kind of um clean up while still making sure that your your incentives are are aligned with each other so you're absolutely right there are ways to structure deals that wouldn't require huge amounts of capital out of your pocket to takeover lists all right Brian give me one last idea so I've become a huge user and consumer of of LinkedIn uh uh content you know for many years I kind of ignored it as a a platform it was like like so many people it was Justin Welsh that kind of turned me on to the idea of of using LinkedIn and when I think about LinkedIn has many characteristics that make it a a great platform uh for creators to focus on first and foremost the competition there is still very low when compared to other platforms like Instagram or or X or or Tik Tok they've become far more uh competitive LinkedIn by by its very nature is is less competitive it's also a growing platform that reaches over a billion uh plus users and it continues to grow but the real Overlook think about that is just the way users act on on LinkedIn versus other platforms when you're on LinkedIn you're there thinking career you're thinking business you're thinking how can I help myself you're also thinking my employer might be watching so the number of trolls on LinkedIn is like one 1,000th it is on Instagram or on um on on Twitter but learning how to master uh LinkedIn learning how to grow on it learning how to create content for it is certainly a a a unique skill set just like every platform there's always a unique skill set that you you have to um have to develop for for getting there so I think there are big ghost writing opportunities to be taken care of uh on on LinkedIn um I think you can uh one other opportunity to take care of or to think about is um finding even even small LinkedIn accounts uh connecting people on LinkedIn to other accounts on LinkedIn to do one-on-one transactions you know some of the value of those potential transactions can be tens hundreds or even hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars uh in in value um so if you created um an agency that whose whole goal was to take a high profile account and connect them to other high-profile accounts like if if you were a um a chief marketing officer in one industry and you're like um I just want to connect with Chief Information officers in my same industry and you had whole accounts that were just developed around connecting One account to say five or 10 other highly targeted but highly valuable accounts you don't even have to get a big follower account uh to to to go on there but if you can make that connection happen in some way there could be huge value added for there one idea there Greg as as you know as a podcast host what if you help them create help that account just create a podcast and instead of reaching out to people to do sales calls you said would you be a guest on my podcast and allow them to create an hour-long conversation with each other that had zero sales connotation to it but allowed that relationship to to to start that alone as a service could lead to super high value sales and uh and and cont and um and content down the road so I think there's a big opportunity on LinkedIn that um for for ghost writers to to connect and that doesn't even involve growing the account to being having huge followings yeah and I'm starting to see more and more ghost writing firms like focused on LinkedIn pop up and I always try to think okay how do you so I I agree with like you know goes back to the whale and Barnacle like the whale is LinkedIn how do you become the barnacle and I'm kind of like the Barnacle everyone's trying to be is the ghost writing agency and I'm like what is and if you want to create a Services business what would be something that is more non obvious and I think that LinkedIn is going to be more and more uh video focused um over the next few years and the reason why is because LinkedIn is literally like three or four years behind everyone always you know they're they just that's fair yeah you know they're just always they're always coping features but it's always three or four years so in three or four years it's going to just like how Instagram is video focused and Twitter X now is video Focus focused and um Tik Tok obviously is video focused you know I think uh LinkedIn will be video focused so the question is how can you reach out to LinkedIn creators or people who post you know I call them LinkedIn creators but it's basically people who post on LinkedIn and you say I will help you create video content or repurpose your content to be video first and this is what it's going to cost I think that is an interesting opportunity yep VD video is a completely different skill set doing video the right way has much higher technical barriers 10x higher barriers than it does to just write a tweet or create some kind of quick little post on on a text based platform so I think you're right there is an opportunity to help text based creators become video based uh creators and I I totally agree with you that overtime LinkedIn is going to gradually lean into that video content uh more more and more Brian as expected this has been a pleasure um if folks folks if you like Brian you want you want him back go comment on the YouTube and uh if you're not if you're not if you're listening to this just go to the YouTube And subscribe uh it's my name Greg Eisenberg ien b r g and let folks know you know let let I think I think you you you did wonderfully and you brought a lot of good energy and Vibes to the table Jimmy Buffett like come on um we hit everything where could folks uh follow your journey uh on the internet uh I'm on all the major platforms so x uh LinkedIn uh in Instagram it's all uh YouTube whatever your platform is so it's all under my name Brian uh faldi and my my company website is a longterm mindset. I love it all right later Brian see you see you Greg

anything where it brings efficient pricing where efficient pricing doesn't already exist is probably a good idea the thing that I always loved about Uber surge pricing was there was like some you like like need like if I needed to get to the hospital on New Year's Eve in New York I'd want to pay for surge pricing and I'd feel grateful that surge pricing existed like I remember when it first started off like that was my first reaction it's like gosh that would be amazing surge pricing might actually save lives and surge pricing by the way of helping people like with like temporary housing or seasonal housing or you know just sort of spreading people out to kind of where there's a lot of empty homes I could imagine that making the world a better place Ali hemed is in the house welcome thanks for having me good to see you um I listened to you on Patrick osan's Podcast and you were spitting like 40 insights a minute and I was like I need this guy I need to understand the business of Finance with this guy so selfishly I you know we're making this happen well I'm going to do my best to live up to that expectation Let's Just Jump Right In what uh what sort of ideas and opportunities are you thinking about right now so the two main themes that we've been spending time on are one you know the uh the lack of housing um and two the price Discovery between Founders and investors and one is sort of like a capital Market structural problem and the other is a thematic problem of like here's an industry or a sector um you know and and so those are some like themes that we're trying to invest along and then there's just broader stuff of what types of asset classes should we try to get into and how do we find those asset classes what philosophies do we have about where to invest and what areas to go into um so I would say if it was a type of startup company or sector that we're looking for it maybe lack of affordable housing and the shifting labor force and if it was a type of investing it would be along the lines of Founders and investors having a trouble having trouble agreeing on price let's dive into affordable housing I'm like selling my apartment right now so it's sort of top of mine um I saw that Joe gbia the co-founder of Airbnb is building he raised like I think like 50 million bucks or something to build 40 or 50 million bucks to build these a startup around small prefab houses what's your thought on the whole prefab Housing Opportunity we're looking for a company that doesn't use a ton of money to figure out how to make it work and you know the problem with a lot of these businesses is you're taking a really big bet that prefab housing is going to be the future they raise a ton of money and they consume a lot of capital but we haven't really seen any of them kind of go through that J curve and get out of it and we're looking for a more Capital efficient way to approach the space you know from a financing perspective it's sort of a weird credit problem because let's imagine I wanted to fund Construction I could fund regular way construction like General Contractors um and you know that seems like it might be risky because have you ever heard of anybody having a good experience with their contractor and feeling like they didn't go over budget and pass time and get the permits done on time and all that stuff like I haven't um and so the prefab homes might be easier because they're sort of copy and paste the problem though is like your severity of loss on a prefab home is quite high so let's imagine you know I don't I don't know Joe Gia but let's imagine he came to us and he said hey guys like you know I agree with you starting these companies is incredibly Capital intensive it's really difficult to get a venture outcome if I'm going to have to raise hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars to go build all these homes so instead what I want to do is I want to go uh raise debt financing and I want the debt financing to finance the construction the in the uh of the of the homes and you know construction financing is a thing that exists my reaction to that would be well Joe what if your business goes bankrupt what do I do with all the parts of the you know prefab home that like whatever robots and whatever technology you're using to build these things like it's it goes away it's not like I'm going to go into the factory and like restart your business for you and by the way if your business went away there's probably some reason for it which is like you were probably losing money on a monthly basis um you know on operating losses because you have this Capital intensive startup so does that mean that I have to also fund your your technology company to recover the debt that I just lent you and so what we would look at that is you know sure is the likelihood that anyone home is going to get constructed higher on time and on budget yes but if we lose money on one home we're probably G to lose money on all the homes all at once and the severity of loss is quite high and what we try to do in debt financing especially we're financing assets is ensure that if we lose money we only lose a small amount of it so you know if if I were to lend to a bunch of general contractors you know and to build 100 homes the old school way sure maybe they'll go a little bit over budget and maybe one or two of them might not even get built but it's very unlikely that they're all correlated to each other and that they would all not get built at the same time and it's a lot easier to basically just say Okay 100 homes are going to get built I'm going to lend $80 against 100 homes uh $100 of homes that way if you know they go 20% over budget I'm still covered it's very difficult to apply some loan to value or Advance rate or however might Finance the stuff if there's binary risk that the whole thing might go poof and so we we hope somebody we think it's inevitable that that will become a space where there are successful winners we just don't think we think a lot of people are going to lose money along the way and um and we'd rather just kind of wait to see the winner emerge so I first of all I like I like that you think it's inevitable it means like you know there's there's something here if you were an entrepreneur and you were starting and you you know you believed in the space you saw the opportunity obviously trillion dollar Plus Market you know asset class you know how would you go about building you know this company's called Samara how would you go about building a Samara that might fit your model a little bit more by the way Samar might work I'm talking about some business that I've never even looked at so gosh you know hopefully hopefully Joe gy is not like listening to this be like what is this idiot talking about this business that I've never talked to him about I apologize um no but one he may have some insight that I don't know about where he's going to be able to build it in a more Capital efficient way the second is you know there might be a a fund that you know is like a two three billion dollar Venture Capital fund where they can take many different bets of 20 3040 $50 million equity financings and you know a few of them don't work out but the the Tam on the outcome is so big that how great would it be if one of them works like there there's a reasonable investor out there for this type of business we're just not it and so the answer might be do exactly what he's doing which is go build this really Capital intensive business um for the founder by the way it might still be a good idea even if for the venture capitalist they they end up getting so diluted or they have to put so much money in that the only outcome they could possibly have after getting $150 million cost basis into the deal you know is 10 times their money if they fund a company that becomes worth five to 10 billion dollars they own 10 20% of it um for the founder that's still a great outcome and so the the answer might be do exactly what he's doing and by the way you know he's got this great background and you know I'm sure people are going to give him capital and he's credible and he's more credible than the average founder and also so so what Joe gbia who I don't know should do is also very different than what a normal founder should do who's gonna have less access to Capital I mean he's the type of person who go should go build a business like this it's just it turns out that in my little part of the world I mostly do debt financing and in debt we can't really take binary risk but if I was a Founder who didn't have access to insane amounts of cap capital I would try to find ways to build more Capital efficient companies in the space build credibility you know Airbnb was was more Capital efficient than this endeavor and it was the success of Airbnb that gave him the capability of raising a lot of capital before he had a lot of validation um so I would go do the same thing that he did which is go find another idea that's housing related that is more Capital efficient build and sell that company um and then use that credibility to go raise a lot of capital out of the gate for a capital ensive one and if you think about the founders who have built really major Capital intensive businesses that make a lot of sense for them specifically like Delian Founders fund with vardo like he had to be Delian you know the average founder can't take that as a learning like they have to first work for Coastal and then Founders fund and then become kind of pseudo famous and have a lot of access to Capital and be a genius and then go start a space company you know there steps um you know but there's a lot of capital efficient things to do I mean I the space that we've Ted talked a lot about is the Adu ecosystem and so you know adus which which some people know about and some people don't was basically came out of this idea that California had which is that you needed to rezone a lot of single family lots and make the multif family lots and by doing so you would increase housing Supply historically that zoning process was complicated because local municipalities would want to block it because they don't want more housing Supply in their specific neighborhood it brings property prices down same demand more Supply um and so they took those zoning out of the hands of the municipalities put them in the hands of the states and force them to approve those and um and and I think most people think that's probably a good idea but there's complication you know if it was an Obviously good idea people would have just said yes parking is an example so maybe companies who can solve the parking problem um tick financing might be an interesting idea you know so these businesses are financed differently it's not like a regular Way Mortgage um and so you know it's a way to finance multi-tenant properties um you probably need a new form of property management uh you probably need development of adus that don't have to pre be preab businesses it might be repurposing of a garage repurposing of something that you know a structure in the backyard adding a structure in the backyard um you know I think there's a lot of businesses that you can go build that have a really really big Tam um that you know aren't just finding new ways to build in the first place um and you know just to give you an idea the the Quantum of the the uh opportunity set you know I most most studies or or sort of research projects on even the city of La would say la needs like over a million new homes and if you assume a starter home is 300 400 500,000 um that's a $500 billion do opportunity that seems like a pretty worthwhile opportunity even if you get a small part of it in LA yeah I mean and that's that's kind of I think why so many entrepreneurs are drawn to the space I think with respect to Joe I think it's funny because like The Grass Is Always Greener right he did like the asset light thing the marketplace thing and then he was just like you know a lot of a lot of consumer software people have this moment where they're like but I just want to build something that I could touch you know um it's very common in entrepreneurs like that and I don't think it's wrong I mean he also earned the right you know he earned the right to go do something like that where you know you're taking less risk on betting on him because he has a level of credibility you're taking more technical risk and capital markets Risk by betting on the company and it's completely rational but you can't take both operator risk and capital markets risk that becomes a bad investment idea and you know so I think if you're going to consume a lot of capital then you have to be more credible operator than if you're going to consume very little for a much higher multiple over you know uh on the investment I think there's probably an opportunity to do prefab houses like luxury preab houses like buying them setting them up in like the cat skills Upstate New York something like that and also setting them up in like Sonoma Napa a bunch of like places that a lot of people want to go to and then you buy like a Soo house type membership for access to it so to me that's more interesting as an entrepreneur like I would less like to be in the business that Joe Gia is in but I'd more rather be in the business of like I'll be your customer like I'll buy a few of these but I'm going to build a brand um and recurring Revenue how you sol the utilization problem you know the challenge is you want to make sure that it's you know the the inventory is available so that like you could consistently go to somoma or Napa or the cat skills or wherever you want to go but you have to have some minimum utilization and then there's always going to be like the peak Seasons which is like during the holiday season people are going to want it even more or less and during like certain working periods you're going to want it more or less and you know and we seen a lot of these sort of like nomadic I think half of them were called Nomad or something these like nomadic startup companies where like you'd like buy a subscription and you could go to like live in like Bangalore and live in London and live like all over the world and it became like an even better you know remote work made it an even better idea developers being able to work from anywhere made it a pretty good idea and and it it got tough even Soo house by the way which is you know the example you gave like they had to cut off Miami and New York City memberships because those got too crowded right have you seen anybody solving that an interesting way the utilization uh and occupancy rate piece well I think there's a bigger Trend that play which is dynamic pricing on the internet so uh there was a huge backlash I'm sure you saw recently with like Wendy's tried to do surge pricing did you see this the uh no oh yeah I did see that that was awesome good for them yeah they tried it they tried it and and God bless them for trying um they claw it back I believe uh but didn't Uber get a bunch of backlash for it remember like when Uber did surge pricing and everyone thought it was just bananas imagine Uber without surge pricing I can't I cannot you know I would I I cannot you you would be thinking of the other startup that got created were the key differentiators that they had surge pricing there's there there's a huge opportunity to create surge pricing as a service to a bunch of businesses that's another business I'm interested in I like that idea what would be your favorite industry that needs surge pricing I think by the way this is the solve this this is the solve for the if anybody is doing this and they want to apply surge pricing to it I'd want to take a look exactly exactly I don't know how much time you have on your hands but in the event you have some extra weekend space there's always nights and weekends you know I live for it so I do I do think that um I saw a business recently actually it's called plus plus grade have you heard about this no I don't have good deal flow what is it plus grade plus grade Canadian company uh I think they ended up raising like two 300 million bucks and they had this great idea which was obviously a lot of people want first class on airlines sure so what they did is they created a widget integrated with a few um Airlines so that there's a bidding for the first class so they make it easier to get uh you know everyone's happy because you know people are getting into these first class seats sometimes at like a discount and the airline's happy because they're utilizing you know they're making more money versus giving it giving it away or something like that I think it's really interesting it's got that Dynamic kind of approach where it's like a bid-based system it's an auction system system it's fun to do and the airline industry it makes a lot of sense um there's a lot of money changing hands so yeah I mean that's oh go ahead I mean anything where it brings efficient pricing where efficient pricing doesn't already exist like is probably a good idea yeah um I guess my reaction is that the competition is for other people who are making their decision to bid on pricing and like there need to be like some like delayed response so like you know if you're an employee of a business that has a policy where if you fly like you know overseas or something you can fly first class you have infinite price elasticity and so then you just have like you know whatever two Sigma employees competing against Citadel employees for like Infinity pricing on on whatever their first class ticket is going to be um I can imagine that being like a hilarious outcome where some like Airline takes down like a $23,000 you knowt is it like British Airways flight totally I think that and and my guess is those whales like that's probably where the majority of that Revenue comes from similar to in the gaming industry like the majority of your Revenue comes from you know 5% of of your customers I think there's a charm in a line though so yeah the one you start differentiating you know like like as if we don't have enough issues with socioeconomic disparity and like lines waiting in line is like one of the last equalizers that exists you know and um I'm not I'm trying to figure out which Industries you could pull that off with without like kind of damaging that like last piece like restaurants it's kind of sad in New York like you know you can pay whether it's like a coner service or some service to like just make sure that you can get a table at a great restaurant but because of that it's taking away like all Serendipity and it's taking away like all like the wonderfulness of a last minute plan or the wonderfulness of a special night out and like you know if you belong to a business or you have some level of access you can just like spend money to have access to great food and if you don't you're like stuck trying to like apply for reservation at midnight 30 days before the reservation opens which is like a pretty crappy experience um so I that would be like I guess the counterargument yeah I mean I'm not saying it makes the world a better place but I I do think that it probably optimizes Revenue now I think that we as entrepreneurs I think we we can start with here's a business opportunity and then okay now we have this business opportunity can we make this beneficial for all parties and I think that's the way to look at it yeah mean the thing that I always loved about Uber surge pricing was there was like some you like like need um and and it was like more like less of a need of like oh I want to have like a slightly better pasta dish it was a need of like like if I needed to get to the hospital on New Year's Eve in New York I'd want to pay for surge pricing and I'd feel grateful that surge pricing existed no matter really who I was and I actually always like I remember when it first started off like that was my first reaction is like gosh that would be amazing like surge pricing might actually save lives um and you know kind of running it through that thought exercise even you know and and and surge pricing by the way you know of helping people like with like temporary housing or you know seasonal housing or you know just sort of spreading people out to kind of where there's a lot of empty empty homes um you know we do have like a major issue so I could imagine that making the world a better place search pricing as applied that a housing Supply yeah I mean because I I think I mean everyone is feeling that it's just become unattainable to buy a house you know and there there's also policy policy shifts that could happen like one of my favorite policies uh is in Singapore where you're economically incentivized to live closer to your parents and the idea is like the government's going to save money because you have child care and Elderly Care like embedded residentially like in like you know uh ge graphically and so like you could make it less expensive but then you could like lower your tax revenue or something to like have it be more affordable or you could have more buying power if you're also going to save money for society in some other way I always thought I always thought like interesting policy changes like that could be kind of fascinating yeah I also think I wish there was an easier way where I could just get like alerts around like here are policy changes in spaces that I care about real estate countries I care about United States and based on that like that'll help me come up with new ideas to build yeah the um because otherwise you have to get lucky right it's like oh I was at a dinner and someone told me that in Singapore and then I looked into it you know it's like how do you open up all these opportunities to people so entrepreneurs can actually how do you how do you systemically see like what are all the policies of every little municipality and state and like government that have like been implemented to increase housing Supply yeah yeah I think I I don't know that that exists um I also think but I think it also like continues to go back into you know where are we directing our Workforce and like how are we incentivizing people to take Majors that are going to help them like add to different parts of society like I I forgot where the um where I heard the idea or maybe it's something that's already being implemented where like student loans should be priced based on the major you're going into and if you're going into a major where under supplied in a certain type of Workforce you should get a student loan and you can still go into some other major that has less application but if we've decided that like we need more construction workers maybe we should like repic the student loans for construction workers both on a Quantum basis and also a cost basis to like incentivize them to go in the right direction um something like that I could imagine feeling obvious yeah I mean and also like imagine not imagine not taking a loan and you just get paid to be in school like the reverse of it yeah the um I we looked for a while at Vocational School where You' partner with the employer and we recently made like a really big investment into an accounting firm and you know one of the ideas was like should we start partnering with that accounting firm to create more accountants and it's like this sort of hilarious I mean so so YouTube has been like a really great impact on my career in my life um because of some of the Investments we've made but also the you know not everybody can be a YouTuber sadly and so sort of like as more and more people only want to be YouTubers less and less people want to be accountants and so like the pricing power of accountants has gotten Higher and Higher and Higher and as we think about like shifting labor forces and like the incentives for those labor forces like what are the ways that you could create them and a school where your education is paid for because an employer is so desperate for new in you know new new people I it feels it feels like that's obvious the thing that we haven't really figured out is how to like kind of get around the negative stigma that for-profit education has because so many private Equity firms and so many people who have run these organizations did just such a poor job and there's just a reputation that's really hard to get around yeah um I'm trying to think like who who's the most successful private Vocational School like who's done really well I mean there's obviously like the University of fedix is but but but really like there's like the dev shops and I'd say like general assembly at least had an outcome and I don't know enough of the story of like what happened and why it didn't become bigger and of where they hit their like constraints because I remember at one point they ended up pivoting from being like sort of like a school to being like a B2B business where they were like Consulting for big organizations I think they kind of just became like a consulting firm at some point um I don't know how lamb is doing I mean obviously Lambda had seemed like it was having a lot of success in the beginning I mean the idea of Lambda was really smart which was basically for folks who don't know you signed up to a boot camp essentially they taught you to be a developer and then there was an income share agreement yeah it was free to go right and but they would just take a percentage of your salary uh for a certain amount of time and I wonder if they need some level of incentive where like it's not quite free but like you don't have any cash outlay except like maybe like you you either either it's free as long as you end up getting a like choosing to take a job in that space um or like as long as you graduate but I feel like if you give something someone to something for free like they end up treating like it was free and it ends up becoming like this free option as opposed to like a dedication or like a like like if you're a doctor and you go through like however many decades of schooling you need like you're gonna end up being a doctor like like very rarely be like well you know now that I've done that I'm gonna be a YouTuber right right you're like pretty pot committed I feel like there needs to be some skin in the game and like maybe one of the ideas is like you have a loan but the loan gets forgiven and it gets put into some retirement account you know and it compounds over some period of time where like it turns into some sort of pension like imagine you know instead of paying $200,000 for school you took a loan at a 4% rate and then you were forced to Escrow in some retirement savings account and it compounded over a really long time and like instead of being in debt you ended up having like this like Nest Egg I don't know there's got to be some flip yeah there's uh there's something there I think that this space was really really popular 2020 2021 maybe even 2022 like the lambdas I was seeing like the Lambda for X pop up everywhere and it sort of fizzled out fizzled out and a lot of people thought like oh this model doesn't really work but for people listening I actually think that income share Agreements are interesting um I also think that I think Lambda raised a bunch of money too um so there's probably a way you can do this more bootstrapped at least to start yeah I mean the the challenge we have with income share agreements is I don't think that they can be viewed as like a replacement of tuition I think they have to be viewed as a subsidy because the the financial product we've always thought was sort of cuspy and the reason is like let's imagine I give you an income share agreement Greg um I I don't know that you need one but let's imagine I gave you one um what are you gonna do like if you move to Spain how do I go get the money from you like how do I service it and then what jurisdiction does it get service and how do I prove the pay stub and if you go to your employer and say hey can you pay me in one account with half the money in another account and half other half or like can you pay me a base comp and a consulting fee like basically once I the underwriting was sort of possible because you could underwrite the efficacy of the school and like your background and like your likelihood of by the way you know maybe maybe it would have required some skin in the game so it didn't feel like a free option but then like if you leave what am I going to do I'm going to come after you for this like income share agreement that's going to hurt the reputation of the school you can't really pay it you might be hiding the money from me how would I know if you're hiding the money from me there's no um precedent of really trying to like foreclose on these income share agreements what is the term on the income share agreement like you need to give some P like people a capability of getting out of it like perpetuity is not a legal concept and so there's like a lot of these issues the financial product itself where I thought it was best applied when it was thought of as a way to subsidize cost um but knowing that like the the school for example would have to like subsidize the capital provider like the capital Provider by themselves just the income share agreement wasn't getting properly compensated for how much risk they were taking it was basically a mediocre or crappier version of a consumer loan but you're getting paid either the same or slightly less and you had headline risk so of your Lambda what what's your next move I mean I think one of the challenges is if you raise a lot of money you have to grow before your feedback loops come out come back and you know at the risk of talking about a business that I wasn't really there for so sorry Lambda now um like I I would imagine that you're educating students you then have to make a decision before you actually know how they're going to do and then like how are you supposed to possibly make like a data driven like uh decision framework and so you're raising a ton of money you're building out a school for needs that you don't even know like you actually need and then like four to five years later you figure out if the first students were any good at what they did not just because they got a job did they stay retained at the job did they get promoted at the job did they successfully pay the income share agreement back and I'm sure Lambda has some data now about it but like it feels like they were forced into this like hypergrowth period before they could really know how the students were doing and so I would probably just take like a more rational cost-efficient approach I probably wouldn't do a space as hot as developing or development because you know I think there's been a lot of Dev schools I think Founders want to solve their own problem they have a hard time hiring engineers and probably go into an industry that was a little bit less competed for and ID probably partner with a handful of employees so you know there was one that I thought was really compelling that was like partnering with trucking companies and teaching people how to be truck drivers that to me seems more compelling less crowded and by the way the feedback loops are probably a lot quicker because how how quantitative is a truck driver you can TR check their mileage you can check their safety you could check their insurance premiums how are they driving are they driving safely are they not driving safely and I bet you you'd feel a little bit less pressure to raise tons and tons of money into that business and grow at hypers speed because there's just going to be less you know competition makes sense I uh I've got two ideas for you two thoughts and I want your you know you're the finance wi so I want your feedback on it so one is okay so we we've got we own a few agency businesses and one of our businesses works with a very large cpg company they do about 500 million a year in Revenue however they're highly levered and they're going you know I guess rates have gone up and they're struggling right now sure so they have we we produce some work for them and they love the work but they've gone to all their vendors and they've basically said like we're not paying you based on how you know for whatever reason yeah I don't know the first you know so my team came to me and and and was like hey do you know like a collection agency or something like we never have you know this never happens to us and I was like no I don't you know I don't know what to do and my thinking is there's probably other agency owners or internet business owners that deal with um collections but there's no like you know beautifully designed stripe Atlas for collections type thing there isn't like I wouldn't even know where to go so my question to you is is there an opportunity in creating a collections type business uh for for more of a digital native entrepreneur yes um do you know J Kahan I don't think soan shoot I hope I'm pronouncing his name right Kahan um so he's got a business that does this um and it's basically trying to like reinvent bad debt collections because it is important and by the way bad debt collections there's all kinds my favorite kind of bad debt collector is a bounty hunter um and I'm do you know how B bonds work I've just seen them un signs so um so I think his company is called january. comom changing debt collection for good so it is a good idea and someone's pursuing it and people should find out more about it because I think he's a really smart guy I've lost touch with him I mean you know we see we see each other around sometimes but I'm not that close to how the business is doing but I've always been impressed by him okay so Bail Bonds I think are this like insane product where basically what happens is like you get arrested and you may may have done it you may have not done it and so you post bail in between then and the trial date and like one of the reasons that you want to post bail is um you know you want to go back to your job if you can't post bail like you can't call your employer from like jail and say hey I'm taking like a two week sick leave until my court date but I swear to God I Didn't Do It um and I you know I probably shouldn't make light of it actually a lot that does happen to people and it's tragic they they do end up spiraling so what happens is you go to a bail bondsman and um the bondsman will basically like if you owe $20,000 or whatever you pay the bail bondsman $2,000 or $1,000 whatever they give the judge $220,000 and then they put a bond on some asset and it might be a car or your house or whatever and the reason bounty hunters exist is like the bondsman doesn't come get you they hire a bounty hunter to come get you and it's like literally these like SII like civilians who just like physically chase you around to try to physically come get you to go to the courthouse and the bondsman gets his money back as long as you go to the courthouse eventually for your trial um and you know that was like not so like that's like this the the worst kind of bad debt collections then there's like the middle of the road bad debt collections which is like your Macy's card and or if I don't know if Macy's still exists I think allegedly it does so you have like this Macy's credit card and you know Macy's isn't gonna like ruin its brand efficacy by like chasing its customers for like money that's owed and so they sell that debt to a bad debt collections agency and then even worse some of these bad debt collections agencies commit fraud and like even though like they they will call you and say hey Greg I you owe Macy's like you know 1,400 bucks or whatever you owe us but they actually never had the claim they just saw that it was being shopped and then when their actual bad debt collections person comes to you and tells you 1400 you're like no no I already paid it turns out you pay the wrong person it's like a really messed up industry and so you're right to think that there's actually a good like something to do there um you know and and with the e-commerce company you that that also just demonstrates that e-commerce companies are difficult to lever I mean or CP businesses like I think I think one of the nice things about software companies is that you don't move stuff around the world and you don't have inventory and cash flow Orient you know planning and stuff but cpg businesses like think about how those businesses operate if they make a $100 of Revenue they're probably spending 10 to15 of the revenues on ads and then they're probably spending another like 30 to $40 of the revenues on Pick and Pack warehousing shipping stuff like that there's probably a couple hundred basis points of the revenue going to returns but let's ignore that for a moment and then and then by way your sgna is usually like 10 15% of your revenues and so you went from like you know 100 minus 10 to 15 for ads so you're at 85 minus 40 for Pick and Pack warehouse and everything else so you're at like um 45 and then you're like overhead was like 10 to 15% and so you know you're now at like 30% um you know like very quickly if these businesses do a really great job they end up at like oh and then your cogs sorry your cogs are usually 30% of your revenues and so have to tighten all of that and if you're really really good as a cpg business you're earning 10 to 20% um IAH margins and by the way here's the other fun thing about a cpg business is you have inventory and you gotta if you're growing the faster you grow the worse your cash flow Dynamics because if you're growing you have to spend money today which you have less of on the inventory you'll need more tomorrow because you're going to need more of because you're growing and then on top of having wonky ebit cash conversion you're going to have volatility during the the year because in Q4 you're probably going to sell more or if you're a popsicle business you're going to sell more in the summer or whatever almost every cpg business has some level of seasonality and so you end up having this like 10 to 20% eaab margin business um that has seasonality and your EBA do margin your EBA do doesn't convert to cash fully it usually converts at like 50 to 60% and so really you know on your revenues you can only withstand 5 to 6% interest and you can only lever your eidal so much you know you can't really lever like if you leverage your EA do five times you know $10 of evah of which you're only collecting $5 of cash and you've taken $50 of debt against it no wonder they can't make their interest payments and so that's also one of the reasons that these cpg businesses have to lever less than than a normal you know a software company could on the same ebit do margin so the best way to not get not need a debt collector is to not finance a cpg business with debt that's true that is true um but you know you look at it and as the vendor we like this is a household brand of course they're going to you know it didn't even cross the team's mind um which I think is fair but it is the reality of the service business is that you will have bad debt and sometimes it's hard to predict um where it's going to come from I guess well the other Challenge and and by the way this is like one of the things that makes some lenders better than others is understand where you are on the utility stack you know and and if you're a vendor like if you're if you're Amazon and you're lending to an Amazon Seller and the Amazon Seller owes you money you have a lot of power you might be junior in the capital stack but if you turn off the person's account you suddenly became senior in the capital stack um you know if you're the CRM you have a capability of getting paid uh you know for ramp I feel like that's one of their benefits is like they're senior in the capital stack or if you're brex or any of these card companies like what you'll notice is like they still get paid because people rely on those cards and those working capital lines and so there's like this ongoing utility um when we think of actually Consumer Credit we think of it very similarly like if I lend somebody money to go get a tattoo like they got a tattoo they may not pay the bill if I lend money for a fridge and I turn off their fridge they're probably gonna pay me so I turn the fridge back on um you know there's like a a company called pjy that we think is like especially compelling where you know if you don't pay your your phone bill they'll like lock your your phone so like you can see stuff coming in like calls and messages and you're probably going to go pay that and so you know one of the things as a vendor is realizing try to like do I have like an ongoing utility to this business and making sure you get paid before your ongoing utility is like sort of like not fully rendered yet I like it um that's why I don't know Char your problem on this payable reable you know J first of all january. comom incredible incredible brand name for business like the idea first of all they got the dotom so kudos to them and also like the idea of January it's like a fresh start um I think is so smart so they they did a good job there yeah oh yeah it's an awesome as soon as I saw that's what they were called now I was like of course yeah I'm in right right actually I think the the best branding R redo or name redo is um EV Ventures turning into headline I didn't see that isn't it just an incredible name headline I'm so jealous H I'm not even happy for them that's how jealous I am you gotta be happy man you got to be happy it's like I'm kidding I'm kidding I wouldn't say it if I wasn't but it felt it made it a more compelling comment you know totally that's fair that's fair I mean names matter especi especially now I think especially as things get more and more commoditized I talk about that often around how important the brand and the name is and um I actually think it's undervalued relative to you know a lot of things so we've been actually buying up domains which actually leads me to my next uh sort of idea for you I'd love your feedback on so we bought the domain recently I think it's startup dividend.com and we're seeing uh a lot a lot of uh you know internet entrepreneurs solo preneurs people building these you know GPT rappers SAS tools that sort of thing um and they're not going the Venture Capital route they're actually um they're building like businesses that make money without losing a lot of money first exactly it's exactly what they're doing yeah oh man as a Credit Professional that makes me feels so good exactly exactly so uh I'm sure it's Ali A lot of these business are Ali approved and a lot of a lot of them are starting to get good unit unit economics but you can't blame them they just don't have some of the money to scale but they're they're afraid of raising Venture at this point and maybe it's not even afraid is the right word they're just kind of like um I don't know if this is a venture scale opportunity um I might not you know I might live in um you know Slovenia and I don't know any venture capitalist so there's there's that as well and so I wonder if there's an opportunity to fund some of these entrepreneurs and I don't know how you'd structure it I'm curious your opinion but that you'd get some dividend uh from from them yeah I mean I think um but I think there's like a lot of benefits I also don't think it's like all one or the other I mean when we started our business we're like pseudo bootstrap pseudo not bootstrap like I I couldn't afford when I started the business to hire a bunch of investment professionals so I raised a few million dollars from individuals and it was important to me to raise from individuals and not firms because I didn't really want to be feel feel like I was being forced on an exit Horizon and you know the and I'm in the business like a professional investor who's institutional their number one job is to make as much money on the investment as possible possible and they sometimes have aligned incentives they sometimes don't have aligned incentives they can't just say yes to things if you know even if they like feel like it might be good for the partnership because they have an obligation to their third party institutional LPS and so there was like this initial want to raise money because we had to but not raise more money than we needed to and then there was like this discipline that came with it because it wasn't like we rais money from like big institutions that would just give us like they weren't like motivated to back of the truck can give tens of millions of dollars more they only wanted to give us more if like it felt like it was like an obvious Roi and and it created some level of discipline in two ways the firstes that really forced us on every dollar that we put out to make sure there's going to be a dollar that came back and it was okay like you know when we built our business we would build like a profitable business line and then we would take the dividends from that profitable business line reinvest them into a new unprofitable business line subsidize it and we had to come with a point of view of like how long were we willing to let that business line be unprofitable for and like go through a J curve because it felt like it was our money that wasn't coming out like if I you know if I decided to open up a new asset class or a new investment business then like those were dividends that I could have otherwise given to myself and my family or just kept on the balance sheet of the business and instead we were like taking that and reinvesting it and like when you feel like there is this Capital constraint it does force you to like make very very like ruthless decisions or like create like a forcing of that of those decisions and you know there's this story that that I remember with one of our Founders where he had he had just raised like a a nine fig financing and he had like a couple hundred million doar of cash in the balance sheet and he were he was telling me he goes you know it used to be so easy to say no to stuff because we just didn't have the money to say to say yes but now that we have the money kind of do to do anything I'm constantly battling people for my nose because they know we can do it I have to like out witht them to explain why we shouldn't and when you have this like natural constraint of not having raised money like it makes all the conversations a lot easier it's like there's no paralysis by analysis like we have the money for that or we don't have the money for that and it's not our very best idea it might be a good idea but it's not our best idea and we can only pursue one idea at a time um and then and then like the The View that we came to is like well maybe what we could do is we could offer some sort of preferred return and you know the negative about something like debt you know even if you have the iida to to um to take on debt is you have a term and you know the money is going to have to get paid back at some point and and if when the money needs to get paid back um Capital markets have changed and you can't just refinance your debt and the debts not willing to roll over like for example if you if you borrowed money at a 8% interest rate or a 12% interest rate and now rates our 500 basis points higher and suddenly ow 17% you might not be able to afford that especially if you're a cpg business and next thing you know like you're kind of in this like sticky situation if you raise preferred Equity you know what you get mostly is you don't have a term on the investment you know you don't own owe the money back at any given time but you can still maybe like acrew an 8% dividend or a 12% dividend and meet them in the middle you know so for example let's imagine your business does $10 million of vitah you raise like a $5 million Equity financing because you want to you know invest in some new form of growth if you only own owe eight% on that $5 million that's $400,000 I mean gez that's that's pretty easy to pay if you want to take $50 million of fin need to really swing for the fenes you can still do that eight you know 8% of $50 million is $4 million so now you have this $4 million dividend you owe on $10 million of profits and there's no like specific time that you need to exit that position um those are ways where if you're willing to offer a preferred return you can ask for like either a higher conversion price or valuation or something similar and I think those are all reasonable you know I think a lot of venture capitalists like they play this game with Founders where it's like I think your company's worth this and the founder think companies worth something else and all the VC is trying to back into is how do they 3x their fund you know or whatever I feel like a lot of VC's or investors could just be a little bit more like look this is what I need from your business I need an 18% return a 20% return how about I contractually obligate it so it's less risky but then we're not playing a game and you know exactly what I want exactly um damn you know your stuff that's why that's why you're here I want to um I want to end off with you telling us a little bit about your business like more about your business and and like the business of you starting it you know like why did why did you see the opportunity because in a lot of ways like I brought you on here not because you're an investor more because I feel like you're an entrepreneur so talk us through what you actually do what your business is and why you think it's an opportunity well first off I'm whatever you want me to be um you know that's for sure for sure for sure um I'm I'm 100% sure I'm going to end up like investing in that company at a much higher markup at some point now ex um and I'm gonna like think back at this moment and it's gonna be embarrassing um sweet our business so we started the business about 10 years ago and you know when I when I was in college I did a startup and I caught the bug and you know I was kind of building apps and and web applications for people and um and wanted to start Angel Investing with some of the money that I had saved and wanted to be a venture capitalist I feel like everybody who does a startup and fails wants to be a VC next like that's like the the right of passage and and I was no different um and you know I made a couple of Investments and I thought well gosh AR isn't everyone going to realize how how great I am at this and that's not what happened um it takes a really long time to see if your startup investment is going to go well and and one of the ways that we've been doing it too is we also like taken some of the money that we were going to invest we hired a bunch of developers and we're starting to like code applications for non-technical Founders we wanted to be called a VC fund everyone called us a Dev shop we just we did whatever we needed to do to be in business but the business model was hard collecting Equity is not a very good high cash flowing business um and and we got lucky that a couple of the companies that we invested in um were fintech businesses that were lending money out and our view on asset back credit at the time was um you know mo most asset classes get crappier and crappier the older they are you know if you think about student loans or consumer Lo loans or auto loans like if you see a car commercial and you're like oh you can like drive this car off the lot at 0% financing you might be like well how um one of the reasons is like it's a highly subsidized loan in an incredibly efficient Capital markets where like auto loans just don't earn that much but you know they've been around for a long time rating agencies are comfortable with them which means Banks and insurance companies can hold them and a lot of understanding credit is understanding the liabilities and how how assets are priced unlike equity in credit assets aren't always priced based on risk they're often based on who's allowed to hold them and so if you think about it like when you put money into a bank you don't expect a very high yield on your deposits if you buy a retirement annuity which guarantees your retirement you probably are only going to get four to 5% yield on that security or on that policy because the the insurance compan is guaranteeing it and like you know Insurance compan like quasi government backed and so it's like not a lot of risk so as soon as an insurance company can hold like an established asset class like Auto or student or consumer all the yield all the return Falls away but we were finding a lot of technology companies that were like unearthing brand new asset classes altogether and financing stuff that had never been financed before where there was always an analogy um you know uh where you could compare it to something that always existed and you could look at the default rate and you could come up with some Assumption of how the risk worked um but you would get paid a lot because rating agencies weren't willing to rate it insurance companies and Banks couldn't hold it and so the only people left to hold it would be like a fund um that that wanted a high return and on top of that the thing that we felt like we knew how to do was take origination risk and origination risk is the same as taking startup and Venture Capital risk except you're not risking principal you're risking your time and so we would do is we would say well you know everybody else in credit what they're trying to do is they're trying to run around and like figure out the best Residential Mortgage back security to buy and at what part of the capital structure they should buy it at and how could they possibly be a little bit smarter you know if you're at uh KKR doing it how could you be a little bit smarter than the person at Blackstone doing it and that felt very competitive what we wanted to do is we wanted to find stuff that nobody cared about today because it never really existed yet you know we don't do income share agreements for some of the reasons I mentioned before but that would be an example of something new and how do we predict whether or not that'll take off and if it doesn't take off we didn't lose any money but we wasted a lot of our time in a way that somebody like black rock or Blackstone or Angelo Gordon isn't willing to do but if it did take off we'd be the only institutional player in the room and we'd be able to crowd everybody else out of the market and build like buying power in that market and pricing power in that market so we ended up building an asset Back Credit business to find these fintech companies and go pursue those opportunities from doing that we ended up investing billions and billions of dollars we became an established investor in the tech ecosystem we built credibility with Founders that you know I had built a business our colleagues had built a business together we had learned how to invest Capital we understood how Capital markets work which sometimes matters sometimes doesn't matter in stter but we really loved backing companies and so we ended up launching a venture capital fund and you know we tried really hard to make it a generalist fund so even though we felt like we had fintech backgrounds we don't think it's an accident that the best VC funds are often journalists um we wanted an opportunity to be relevant to a lot of people and we felt like you know a lot of the experiences we had span more than just credit markets we felt like we in my business when I raised LP Capital as an Enterprise sale you know I have a recurring Revenue stream it takes me 18 to 24 months to off and close and build a relationship I want to then account manage that relationship and upssize it I run a you know asset management businesses are kind of like SAS companies um with you know with margins and recurring revenue and everything else and um and so we built a successful Venture Capital business that's done well and and and we've had a lot of fun doing it we've had an ability to partner with a lot of great entrepreneurs and then more recently we launched a fund that we call hybrid and um and there we do um what we call non-distress special situations we're looking for complicated situations ations or situations where a founder and investor can't agree on price or the market can't agree at the founder on price and we'll offer them a security that has elements of equity and elements of debt and usually what we're doing is we're looking for the downside protection of debt but we're willing to take some Equity upside like warrants or something in exchange for not taking all the interest in current pay that way a Founder can take the otod that they're earning and invest it back into the business as opposed to just paying a ton of Interest with it and that just curious like what is the stage of a comp you know what are we talking are we talking like series B series C yeah so so often these are founder own companies so they couldn't be staged with a round uh around but you know to give you an idea that the perfect business for us does something between 50 and $150 million of revenues you know their cash flow positive they do seven eight figures of IAH they're growing above 10 15% probably under 50% you know they're over 50% the business might be growing out of control or they're probably being chased by ACH growth Equity investors where people don't care about picking the right price because even if they get the price wrong the company will quickly grow into the price anyway um and you know usually the company has bootstrapped itself where we feel like the fact that the company's bootstrapped itself to that scale demonstrates the quality of the business and their ability to generate cash flows if you raise a $100 million to generate $80 million of annualized Revenue that's not that impressive to us if you raise five million of equity to get to 50 million of Revenue we're like wow you're clearly doing something you are using very little Capital to generate quite a lot of value and we're looking for that capital or at least Equity efficiency I like it yeah I mean it's different you know it's different than what I normally hear uh in the in the VC sphere which I like and um where where could folks I guess find you on the internet and learn more about you or potentially partner with you I I respond to most cold emails I get I don't you know there there's sometimes short responses but uh what I'll try to do is at least route them to the right person in our organization it's just Ali at coov venture. VC um especially if there's a pitch or some company like you know we we find that companies can come from anywhere um I'm on Twitter at Ali B Hamed I used to tweet more it's kind of scary to Tweet now I feel like anything you could say uh it's it's difficult to to communicate Nuance but but I like it when I do um and uh and then you know those are the main two places cool yeah don't what we ask people not to do is not just to show up to the office you know showing up to the office cold is a bad idea totally don't give up on tweeting you know I think uh tell the people how you feel I'll get i'll get back into it I I don't um I feel like I've spent most of my career so far realizing how wrong I am about a lot of things that uh you know it's hard to Proclaim stuff on the internet and and I used to find a lot more joy in it when nobody read them you know now there's the accident of somebody might actually read it you only need one thing to be right per year and if you just that's all that's all you need that's definitely Venture Capital yeah yeah I mean I being a venture capitalist is awesome you know you can make a time being in credit is like being a professional free throw shooter you know it's like there's not there's no Glory or professional penalty kicker whenever I'm watching a soccer match everybody loves PKS and I'm looking I'm like this reminds me of my job this sucks you're out it's like yeah Fair all right man well good good hanging out and I'll uh I'll see you around Greg thank you so much for the time really appreciate it and uh and we'll talk soon this is fun later

have you seen retail AI for sure you have when I did the demo last week like they were setting up like a dental appointment I would try to you know throw it off like it was perfect I was like imagine if you can build this at scale now they can take the call with the lead they can then set up the next call and then also the lead might say oh I need to reschedule they can handle all the rescheduling it'll probably get to a point where eventually it can just close the customer too I think that's going to be a big thing because you saw the the Clara um report like 2 days ago they think they're going to add 40 million in profit because they added like 700 new agents uh AI agents so how how are we not going to go into this world it is so good to see you yeah been seeing you for a couple hours early but likewise we just recorded Eric's podcast right before this but I Greg did great I had to I had to bring you on for a few ideas that you had and you you've been gracious to write down a few ideas yeah I know great questions and I got them right here MH so you got a lot but let's start with this paper for performance agency why why is that a business idea that's exciting you right now because when I hear paper performance I'm like hasn't it been done before like why is paper performance an interesting startup opportunity right now I'll give you two stories on this one um so one of my friends his pay for performance agency does $80 million a year 30 million in profit and they have like 30 employees and it's like okay well that sounds agencies are boring business it doesn't scale well blah blah blah it's like no like all he does is he focuses on one industry and just runs paid ads he's really good at copyrighting they're really good at strategy he's his uh co-founder Technical and they just build a lot of interesting things for people in that that industry and what they do is let's say you are in the finance industry I'll say okay well how much are you going to pay per customer like 500 bucks I like okay we're going to run a test we're going to run some traffic towards you and if you like the customers we can continue to conversation but there's no need for long-term commitment you only pay us if we perform that's a good offer and my whole thing is as a marketer if you're a good marketer you would charge on performance right but most people aren't willing to take the risk um and I've always wanted to to emulate that model and so I don't think pay for performance will ever go away in fact I think you know we can go towards like smart contracts I think it's G to get even crazier right the best marketers are going to capture a like even more value I also think that in like an AI world where an AI and just like data world the market has more data so they're able to underwrite Y and be like okay we're willing to bet on this particular opportunity right yep and here here's the other thing yes and like imagine all the stuff you're going to be able to build which you might get into but there's another pay for performance agency they focus on telecoms and um I think they're probably doing over a billion in Revenue now and one of the guys I used to work with at another agency a long time ago he was one of their early employees and they were like not really doing much at the beginning I think they were doing like a couple million dollars a year year and then they started do this pay for for pay for performance thing tongue twister um where they would basically drive you leads through Google ads and then they get paid for the leads eventually what they did was they got bigger they started acquiring call centers and then they would basically just gift wrap a customer for you and then a bunch of private Equity like invested but they just gift wrap customers for like AT&T Verizon you know all these like T-Mobile and all that now um and so I think it's a big opportunity because there's not a lot of capital expenditures to set set it all up I feel like a lot of people have done payer performance in the lead space is that correct like Insurance lead sorry yeah yeah because like you want to go into a space where they'll pay you a lot for lead right so what other spaces would be interesting I think Finance uh depends on like you know I think there are a lot of crypto companies reaching out to us right a lot of the biggest exchanges they all want to do pay for performance and you know there's money in crypto right um a is a very broad space I think you need to focus on the actual industry you can't just say SAS or AI it's got to be like you know um for like hotels would be another example right it just wherever they're they're going to pay high CPAs right so you just make a list of industries that are paying high CPAs and then create a brand a landing page yep uh and you test and like my friend by the way what he does is he creates a lot of different brands so he might have like 20 different websites like you know um California Hotel group or something or Florida hotel group and he just drives traffic there cuz like if I'm working with you and you decide you want to screw us or something sure you can cut us off but we'll just go to your competitor right and so the relationship is a lot more balanced now I like it I feel like you know a lot of the affiliate world does a lot of this paper this is basically affiliate marketing but the way he does it and the way these like these are actual businesses they're not doing it in like dirty ways and they're not doing it like they won't do anything it takes to get the conversion uh other other startup idea that you've been thinking a little bit about is AI agents tell me about what sort of Agents well maybe explain what an agent is and and why you're interested in it so have you seen retail AI for sure you have yeah okay so tell people what it is retail AI is it's like a it's basically like a voice llm right and you can basically I when I did the demo last week it was with um like they were setting up like a dental appointment it's like what's your name blah blah blah and it like I would try to you know throw it off like it was perfect I was like it's like oh when you would Eric you would try to throw it off like when when do you want to have a a call or like when do you want to meet I was like uh never and she's like okay well let us know when you want to meet and they boom hang up right and so imagine if you can build this at scale now these agents at scale for companies where um they can they can take the call with the lead they can then set up the next call and then also the lead might the lead might say oh I need to reschedule they can handle all the rescheduling so there's there's a tool called scheduler.com too especially if it's SAS or help a customer or try to set up phone calls to move over to your AES um I think that's going to be a big thing because you saw the the CLA um report like two days ago it's like what they added they think they're going to add 40 million in profit because they added like 700 new agents uh AI agents and they handle like 2.3 million chats and like I don't know like 80 to 90% faster so how how are we not going to go into this world I also think there's a huge opportunity to just go to companies with big customer service teams and be like going back to your pay performance thing it's like we're about to save you $2 million a month give us a percentage of that by using agents for customer service so I was thinking on like exactly the taking the percentage piece but then I listened to um I listened to a podcast episode I think it was my first million and um a smart bear God what's his name again um the guy that found a WP engine James Cohen maybe uh something like that the wp engine guy the wp engine guy so this guy he and as I was thinking about this he literally he was like yeah you guys might as well just like you can either try to save a company money and take a percentage there or you can just go straight for the value and you'll capture like four to eight times more and I'm like that was the thing that was kind of like bugging me in the back of my head go for the value what does he mean by that just like instead of saying hey I'm going to save you money it's like no I'm going to get you like X more customers or something like that um and just charge them like up front like that but like I had this like little like twist like a little knot in my in the back of my mind and like he just like unnoted it so so yeah a good uh a good line a good podcast line sometimes that does that I uh I don't know I think um contingency lawyers right like people who lawyers who will say yeah I'll take your case but I want 50% of the money I get I think like yeah if you can take a fat percentage that fat percentage that's awesome yeah which is probably the move yeah I also think that if you're trying to start like something like an AI customer service agency like that sometimes it's really helpful start at a percentage of cost savings and then you can move to to something else yeah or I think to your point I think if you want to drisk yourself the entrepreneur wants to drisk them maybe there's a base cost First just so there's some skin in the game because I've seen a lot of situations where people will save money and then like they just will stiff them and they just won't pay the money I think there's an opportunity to create uh paper performance conversion rate optimization agency you know there's actually a a pay for performance cro agency based in Atlanta I think they're I forgot their name I would oh spiralize that's their name and let's say your conversion your Ecom conversion rates 1% right now I'm like okay well if we double it to 2% how much money is that worth well 25 million it's like okay well we're going to take 2 and a half million on that 10% is that fair oh yeah it's fair and that's what they do they just take a spread that that I think is a huge opportunity I think that's the move and then you you just then you start laying on Smart contracts and everything um which is we're still probably like 5 10 years out how would you uh how do you see smart contracts playing it a role in that well I I think like chain link is moving they they do a lot of stuff in Enterprise right and so like I think um I the way I imagine it working is like okay we have an agreement um if we hit these numbers for you um this money goes into escrow and you know it's released to us like a portion is released to us if we hit these numbers if we don't by this time period Then the money goes back to the customer and then it's like it's very transparent and it's fair and it doesn't there's no anxiety on either side yeah yeah I feel like smart contracts is going to be like something like that such an obvious you know use case yeah I feel like speculation Bitcoin speculation Bitcoin goes up and like smart contracts like that some you know I don't need to trust a third party um that's where I think crypto is really interesting that's why defi works so well yeah that's why defi works so well yeah do you have any other smart contract ideas um I think also just in general like with a in general with agencies like I don't know about you but you know we've had we've had two clients who just didn't pay us because of um financial difficulties MH um and the and and one of them particularly is like a a huge company now if it was a smart contract like we did our work we delivered it they actually loved it mhm uh if the money was in an account it just got like escrowed into our account but what ended up happening was um they hit some hard times and there was a bunch of people a bunch of debt that they had to pay off so yeah I'm interested in smart contract plus service providers yeah so are they like ignoring you now no they're ignoring us it's so it sucks yeah that sucks like what would you do honest I just side yeah yeah what do you do in like situation like that I think even if you sue them it doesn't matter cuz it takes forever anyway and then they you know there's like appeals and everything and it's like that this is why smart contracts need to need to happen um but what I I think I'll give you another example with how we actually built something internally for my agency yeah um I bought the domain for it um incentive. right and so you can like my whole thing in we're talking a little bit ago about how we see Life as a game or at least I see Life as a game yep and might then if that's the case then how do we just gamify everything and so you know for we have these things uh we we have an employee engagement tool called 155 and it's like if you feel that out on time each week you know by end of day like you know you get uh a dollar or $2 doll in Solana right um or if like you get like a really high rating from someone or you you complete all these deadlines in youra like a lot of stuff is trackable through apis um but you can give people little micro incentives and then a leaderboard gets created you can see who's getting the most stuff done or whatever you can see who's lagging behind and that's also grounds for like who should be promoted and who shouldn't and maybe who should be cut too um and it that increased our engagement on a lot of these um these tools by like I think it was like 77% crazy we had it going and we still have we still have the code and everything but it's like I'm just really you know we got to focus right So eventually I'll probably come back to it but um did you did you see the Apple Vision Pro uh demo of someone vacuuming yeah and there was just like coins and they're like vacuuming the coins mhm what do you think of that I think that's awesome and now imagine if you can reward your kids and based on how many coins they collect right right totally that for sure is going to happen and it's going to work yeah like it's going to work like kids want to play I wanted to play yeah I was looking at I was like it gave me yeah it's like it was like uh in Mario when you're trying to get all the coins you know yeah yeah it was really really cool yeah what other what other boring parts of life can we gamify okay well I mean you're married so it's like you know you get you probably get asked to take the trash out all the time right so it's like I do actually yeah yeah yeah so it's like gamify all the things that you want your spouse to do and there's little micro rewards it maybe it doesn't have to be money it can be something else right yeah like what else what else can we get rewarded by maybe it's like I'd imagine like all like your favorite stores are going to have like little coins and so maybe you get an Amazon coin or something right yeah so I like it the question is who's going to build I mean maybe you would just build all this stuff like let me know if you build all this stuff so well who's going to build I think it's like it's an interesting time with with spatial Computing is because like it's early Apple said they're going to sell 500,000 units in the next 12 months they're breaking that they're going to break or I think they said 400 and now it's 500 it might be 600 yeah point is I think it's like even if you got 10% of that right it's like still not huge right um so I think on one hand it's a small Market but on the other hand now is the time to sort of get the Reps in yeah smartphones were really small Market at some point I mean but but what we talked about um maybe like an hour ago or so is like the with AI co-pilots and everything like developers are becoming four to 8X more effective and so you can probably build a lot of this stuff um as long as you have the vision um and The Taste yeah yeah The Taste yes yeah you need to have the taste to I mean when I was watching that demo of the the vacuum like the sounds and the way the coins looked it like felt good it felt good right and that's what a good product does right like think of like the difference of when you close a door on a I don't know a Rolls-Royce versus uh Honda Civic the sound is going to be different never heard of Rolls-Royce clothes neither have I but I imagine it's pretty SI I get it I get it yeah it's like a crisper sound yeah yeah I mean I drive a Volvo you've been in my car oh yeah you took me home yeah from poker yeah thank you for that it's not the nicest car on the planet it's about 10 years old but it's safe those safety features like I once was driving and someone like ran across and it it stopped my car stopped oh like automatically automatically okay got it and those are the little things right and that's what great product design is MH totally with you yeah what else is on your mind I mean do you pay for like a longevity practitioner or anything like that I don't but but should I okay well let me tell you my pain in the ass story right now so um every and I'm happy to introduce you to these guys um every quarter they'll draw like 10 vials of my blood and they'll tell you like all my metrics but it's automatically inevitably what happens is oh you need to have all these supplements now I'm just like dude and then it cost you like you know a lot of money too um how much is a lot of money like so like the last invoice I got was like $5,000 and like one of the supplements alone was like 2,800 I was like can I just like take that out um so like but my markers have gotten a lot better I think the trouble with that is like it's still a lot of manual work and so I'm just like well how can I just have like uh imagine like levels right like it's kind of stuck in you but like ongoing Biometrics um it's scanning you every day it's coming up with recommendations for you and then maybe it's like Auto ordering for you too and maybe it's using like Mark Cuban's like Cost Plus drugs thing where the drugs are a lot cheaper cuz all this stuff is marked up um and you know I think if you can do deep discounts with this and have it be more um less of a pain in the ass a better user experience I think you're going to get a lot more people like a lot more people are caring about their sleep now a lot less people are going to clubs yeah so this is just I think this space is just going to get a lot bigger I mean anything to do with sleep just in general like is I mean that's what we've learned right is like sleep is such a big driver of health and and wellness and like you can literally die if you don't get good sleep dude kids now like the um I don't know if you saw this but the Sleep scores are like people are sleeping earlier now and then like the Sleep scores are getting better people aren't drinking as much alcohol it's like all the education that's happening like I think the world's trending towards healthier now like doct Peter artia Dr Andrew huberman yeah but those guys like artia isn't he like charge like a upazi to be like how do how do we get up you know artia in your pocket and you know what I mean like it feels like yes huberman does a free podcast so you can learn that way yeah but so I there's um haven't you seen this dea. where they just like scan everyone's podcast and then you can just it's like a little llm you can just ask questions okay um that's I don't know how legal that's going to be in the future but that's what's happening right now they're just scanning all huberman stuff um petera podcast the drive yeah a lot of the stuff is free and then he has some of the paid stuff okay yeah um I have a health idea yeah what so I recently I recently got a night a night guard what's that so it's a mouth guard and I sleep at night with because I grind my teeth I don't I think because I drink too much caffeine or something yeah anyways turns out like it's very like a shocking amount of people wear night guards in the US it's just to stop the teeth grinding it's like basically a plastic thing that you know it's not annoying it's annoying yeah it's totally annoying yeah so yeah make idea number one make a less annoying Night Guard big Market but no the real idea is I heard about someone who would put whitening in their Night Guard so that when they're sleeping it whitens whitens their teeth okay interesting there's the idea I like it and so with the night the night guard are you like using your mouth to breathe when you sleep or I mean I try to sleep with my mouth closed just cu because apparently it's better for you yeah um the Nar I mean it's basically just plastic it's like a plastic thing that goes over your teeth yeah I mean everyone's complaining about microplastics right so how do you you can solve for the microplastic piece the whitening piece totally and then what I do this is combining our habits and you can I've been wearing sleep tape for like seven to eight years before it even became cool and like that forces me to use my nose to breathe so all three of those things I think you're good cuz didn't uh Sam and Sean talk about that mouth tape business that does like 14 million a year yep that's just good messaging and good storytelling and good branding totally and what's it called hostage tape hostage tape yeah I mean I wonder what other opportunities exist where the product exists already and you just have to Rebrand it Rebrand it yeah I mean all over the place okay like okay I'm Asian right I like you're Asian yeah you guys can't see me on the video but like Asians like wearing slippers that's my point and so how do you create like a better version of slippers like the Americanized versions like we like wearing like bamboo slippers um reason because like you know it's more it's more Airy we'll just put it that way um but yeah how do you brand something where it's like anti sweat slippers and bamboo is actually good for that totally yeah totally someone should do that bamboo Linens became really big recently yeah yeah that's the other thing is that what you use uh I don't but I've used it in the past I think there's a huge opportunity like startup ideas wise to see what's working in one culture and bring it to another culture yeah because each culture has like good habits yeah like you know Indian cultures they're very um very like Buddhists anden I that's Asian cultures too I heard uh I was just talking to someone about this like the idea of a supper club which is a place where you go for dinner that turns into Club yeah is actually not that popular in America but is popular in places like Europe mhm and is this a supper club so I thought it was supper club or and then I heard on a podcast someone said a British person said super Club Supper Club interesting yeah oh well a British person must know English better than us so so anyway continue yeah a Canadian American what do we know but yeah like um this isn't an internet startup idea or anything but like the idea around supper club which like I said like you you know I remember in Montreal I used to you know I went to a few of them where you'd sit you go with a group of friends you have dinner and then they kind of like remove the chairs after and it kind of like people have drinks stay around some dance whatever y it's like okay how do you bring that to another another city right and it's interesting I think you can combine that that like we're we're now moving into community so that piece for sure like I think that's a good idea yeah but also like we talked about EO and YPO what about EO for like um certain Community types right so like we know Sam started Hampton but um I have a I know someone he started a dental entrepreneurs organization Deo wow right and Neil and I we just started agency Owners Association right um and I think people crave Community but it's like you need specific Community too right and like YP and EO they've been around for a while um there's a lot of space I think totally yeah I have a friend who has a Hampton like competitor called Ben Wise oh interesting and it's like for CTO and CMOS that's cool yeah Chief remember that Chief yeah Chief was for women entrepreneurs or I think it's just women Executives women Executives that's right um so I think it's sort of like the unbundling of uh YPO yeah yeah and yeah there's a ton of opportunity there and the cool thing is it doesn't cost a lot of money to get going like what do you need a brand yeah a landing page and a vertical yeah communities and agencies like low capex good to go yes are you are you still bullish on I mean you run an agency I used to hate it yeah I mean because I I come from working in Tech right I'm like Oh my poooo doesn't stink I I'm too good for a Services business um but like you know the PO I do with Neil like just looking at numbers we talk all the time and pre 2022 if you're at five million EA that you can sell for 15 to 20 if if like your agency is really good um 15 to 20x and so that's like a hundred million business if you wanted to sell but then the other thing is if your agency's doing you know five 1020 million in profit a year that's an exit for you every single year yeah and then then you can sell later if you want and so I think with my um my founder Buddies the consensus now is like no like you want to build something generational forget a decade like 20 30 years and we're just like let's just keep compounding and I think any business like it's a it's a boring business it's not sexy but um it's also what I know and like the audiences that I've created like it just makes sense to funnel it into that so it seems like the best engine and then I can also build cool products and services especially with AI being so deflationary so it makes a lot of sense to me yeah and you yeah you can incubate software products I think um I mean this Noah Kagan doesn't run an agency but I had him on the Pod recently and he he was you know he has appsumo mhm is doing really well yeah it's 80 million a year 8 million a year but he's got all these like kind of sass software products that he's spitting up on the side yeah um yeah well I mean let's use him as an example it's like he had Sumo back in the day the pop-up thing and that quickly got up to eight figures I think yeah um and but then it didn't work out and then but he had like a lot of things going on and um he was sitting in that seat and it just like you know focused at the end of the day is is is he I think he he realized how important that was and I think I just got punched in a face so many times I'm just like things are a lot better when I just focus you know um so I'm just very bullish on agency it seems Seems like you're like that too and you have your own model it's like Community First which I think is genius and then agency exactly yeah other than paper performance any agency ideas or any spaces that you think over the next 12 to 18 months there's opportunity to build in yeah well I mean we probably have the same mindset here AI transformation agencies like everybody like digital transformation is still a thing right now now it's AI transformation um I think I mean look at boring marketer right like AI assisted content yeah um I think we're going to see more agencies doing programmatic SEO too yeah because like you know you have this one to twoyear window where you can do it and I think search just changes um so yeah and I think I think we're going to see more I think creative becoming more and more of an X Factor yep and um it's really hard to find a damn good creative agency so yeah I like it Eric where could people get more of your ideas yeah uh just Eric oiu on Instagram or Twitter and or you can just go to the search for leveling up Eric Sue on YouTube and uh that's where I'll hang out too amazing all right thanks a lot man thanks for having me later

hello everyone good to good to see you good to hear from you today we're going to do something a little bit different it's just me on the Pod and I'm just going to talk about some startup ideas I have right now some things I'm thinking about I'm recording live from Mexico City I got my coffee with me and uh the creative juices are flowing so I figured I'd just hit record and tell you how I'm feeling about things yesterday James clear the New York Times bestselling author came out with an app called the Adams app and for those you who don't know James is a New York Times well he's a New York Times best author but he he's the guy for habits if you want to get better at at habits you go to James and he's got one of the best selling business books of all time so he created a really beautiful app that basically drives that ritual of getting better at your habits and it's just taken off um it's it's you know just looking at the App Store it's ahead of Spotify it's ahead of HBO it's ahead of Netflix I think what we're seeing is this is a part of a bigger opportunity around creators and creating software products in the past if you were a Creator what you would do would be you go the Mr Beast approach so Mr Beast created a big audience and then he created Mr Beast Burgers which was the ghost kitchen selling hamburgers he created M uh febles which is a chocolate bar company with creating physical products you have uh you know just a lot more headaches um supply chain uh merchandising distribution Distributors it's a lot more difficult to get to the top selling a physical product than it is to get to the top using Code when I look at the James Clear Playbook I think I look something like this number one you own a category so you try to own a category James obviously owns the habits category number two you build an internet audience James has spent a lot of time years building his 321 newsletter even if you go on his Instagram uh which he has a lot of followers I think in the millions it's all about driving people back to the newsletter so he spent years building his newsletter then you earn credibility number three obviously he's a New York Times bestselling author there's other ways to gain credibility but I think having credibility when you're launching a software product is critical the fourth is you build beautiful software for product Market fit uh The Habit app is isn't just an app it's it's beautiful and I think they did a really good job and from what I've heard from their Community it's absolutely stunning um and they love it they're really enjoying it so number five you pick another habit so you don't just build this app for one particular use case no the big idea is actually you pick another habit or you pick another ritual and you create another app or multiple apps so I could easily see James creating a sobriety app a fasting app what are all the different habits that are most popular and then he can basically unbundle his own app and create these verticals and then I can imagine him charging monthly for it or onetime fees for it and number six you essentially build a constellation software or birkshire hathway but for your word you know constellation software for those of you don't know Canadian company that basically has been buying vertical SAS apps for I think over 25 years they've built this constellation of software and it's it's an incredible performing stock like I don't have the numbers in front of me but it's you know it's up thousands of percent over the last 10 years James could easily do something like this easily do something like this where he's creating multiple apps either that he's incubating himself or with an agency and or he's actually going and acquiring those businesses and then putting his name on it and then step seven he can either IPO that business just like constellation software uh he can sell that business which is really important for creators because they're no longer you know doing the speaker circuit or being reliant on YouTube ads uh they've got a business that they can rely on and actually sell the business so I think this new Creator Playbook is going to be very attractive to creators because they're in the market for creating something that you know they can make money while they sleep so you can either sell the business or you can just cash flow that business forever he doesn't need to sell it I can see a world where he has 10 apps each app is making anywhere between 4 and $40 million a year in revenue and he just is just cash flowing it so I wanted to bring this to your attention just because I think there's a ton of other names words that have yet to be claimed and I'm thinking about this a lot and I'm also thinking about it in the context of you know we have an agency called LCA which is an innovation agency that partners with companies like this and we actually go and create products like this so I think that there's probably hundreds if not a thousand plus uh different opportunities where you can do this and I think you're just going to start to see a lot of creators go the software route over traditionally what they've been going for which is the cpg route so that's idea number one something to think about um something for you to think about and think and and just brainstorm what are different words that there's opportunities and if you're not the Creator can you partner with the Creator the second idea I you know I've been thinking a lot about is I stumbled you know and I've actually talked about this on the Pod like I don't know a year and a half ago but I stumbled upon this guy his name is Tyler vukan mcski 23-year-old guy from Central Jersey he's got 2.2 million followers on Tik Tok and he basically goes into the Diamond District in in New York and he negotiates on what luxury watches and he has a cam crew that follows him and by camera crew I mean like another 23-year-old guy from Central Jersey that is filming him you know either on a camera or on just an iPhone mostly and he's crushing it he's crushing it in two ways one is he actually has a paid community of other people buying and selling watches and rumor has it that he's doing $500,000 a month of Revenue just from that paid community so what he's doing is you know people watch him about buying and selling luxury watches and then he's just like hey if you want to buy a watch go vuk verified and he charges like I don't know $20 a month to get access to this group and it's a lot of like Watch dealers or people who are in in the business but also people just want to buy a watch at a good price now $500,000 a month and you know the margin there is 99.9% that's one thing he's doing and then the second thing he's doing is he's opening his own Diamond Jewelry Exchange in Jersey in Central Jersey and uh you know whole space with other people you know buying and selling jewelry it's not open yet but he's going to rent those spaces to different luxury dealers so why is this interesting why should you care about it and why should you you know steal this model and we'll put up a video in this podcast like right now so you can listen to Tyler in one of his videos to get a sense of what these realtime luxury negotiations look like and by the way he was the first to do this welcome back to fast flips uh Yasha has a boost sky a juvilee bracelet that I really need I'm going to sell for 247 I got to go pick it up from Jasmine and Melanie hopefully I can pay like 23 and make myself 1,700 bucks how are you Hi friend how are you the price was 23 he beautiful beautiful time piece you whisper what are you Whispering 234 238 I need it give me it thank you what 238 I just said yeah just bought this [ __ ] thing for 238 Tony needs it about to go drop it off with him now hopefully he pays my asking price to 25,000 is going to be a [ __ ] issue there he is show Tony what's up how you doing everything good here's the watch uh just give me 252 it's fine 252 bro you said like 24ish didn't say any price just told you I'll get it guys a genie it's nice uh I don't know what you going to do now um I have to go do you want my chain though yeah I got your Chance's coming right now listen let's make it very easy 248 that's it finish you 249 done that you not me okay cheers thank you um okay I'll pay you uh wire and I'm going to get you the chain is coming in like 5 minutes all right anyway 24900 minus 23 8 thank you thank you made 1,00 bucks on that um the day is still young not really it's like 300 p.m. already you know I think that's what's really interesting is no one was recording luxury watch you know hey like I'll buy this Rolex from you from $10,000 and then the seller is like no it's 8,000 and then there's the back and forth and it's all these characters and it was absolutely genius the right Niche the right format the right timing he's been doing it for 2 years before I get into the idea that I think you can have around this he actually you know the other day gave some really good advice on how you can grow like him on social and I just want to share it real quickly don't do what everyone's doing create a new kind of video that no one else is making so he did that like jewelry exchange stuff make your videos both fun and informative keep trying different things until something sticks once you find something that works keep doing more of that and stop doing what doesn't work and then probably one of my favorite piece of his advice is stack what works so if you see that people are connecting to being funny that you're funny do more of the funny stuff if you see that they like more of the educational stuff and funny stuff do funny and educational and then post something every day you know obviously be consistent my prediction here is there's 100 plus other watch talk esque opportunities ripe for Innovation so what Tyler vum did for luxury watch shelling I think that there's tons of different other verticals that you can actually go and create some new format for example the negotiation stuff just bring a camera around build you know it has to be a niche like luxury luxury watches that you know there's a lot of demand and and pend up demand but I think that you know there's a huge opportunity to basically take his Playbook of finding the right Niche finding the right format finding the right timing of course and then building something starting with an audience and then thinking as the product to be either a Marketplace or thinking about the product to be a paid Community because that way the margins are just so ridiculous and you can actually take some of that profit like what he's doing you know he's making $500,000 a month and he's reinvesting that into things like real estate you know the phys Marketplace and I just see this as another Trend that is only beginning and I think there's a you know I did some preliminary research and there's like there is like literally 100 plus different opportunities like this um and you know maybe I'll I'll talk more about some of these opportunities in future videos and and on the Pod but I just wanted to get you thinking about this huge opportunity and and just his Playbook and how it sounds like so simple but but there there really is again so many other areas you can do this for the last idea I wanted to talk about today is I've been watching the YouTuber coffeezilla recently he's got you know a few million YouTube subscribers and what he does is he's basically like an investigative journalist he like goes in front of his camera he has his coffee and you always see it steaming up you like the steam from the coffee and that's kind of like his shtick and he goes and he finds people who are essentially scamming other people and he OU them and he does really good investigative journalist so for example he did something on I think you know Logan Paul around he had like a crypto thing that you know they never delivered on the project and he goes deep on it or Grant Cardone he talks about like why Grant Cardone scams people and stuff like that or or misleads people now here's my idea I think that there's a coffeezilla opportunity but for Tech what I mean by that is there's a lot of action in the tech space new apps coming out every day AI startups Venture capitals all this stuff and there used to be Gawker media which actually covered a lot of the gossip part of Technology but I think that there's an opportunity to do something like a coffeezilla for Tech where he goes or she goes or they go you know person goes and invest investigates hey this person says that they're doing 8 million AR are they really doing 8 million AR or this person just raised $100 million but in actual fact they raised it three years ago but only announced it today I just think that the tech category because it's become so big you know there's hundreds of thousands no millions of people working in Tech there's enough of people interested in the investigative journalism slash a little bit gossipy part um that I think that there's a huge opportunity to begin by building an internet audience there probably YouTube to start there are versions of this that happen like there's VC brags on Twitter that's kind of like a jokey uh Twitter account but there's like a little gossipy stuff but I'm talking about like a non-anonymous real journalist going deep on these topics and building a real Media company around it so those are my three things ideas startup ideas niches I'm thinking about right now and uh I want to share where with you on the where it happens pod because this is this is where we talk about these ideas uh it's really the only place where you can come and and uh I only want to talk about ideas on this podcast and I only want to talk about ideas because I think that uh it'll get your creative juices flowing and if you're working a full-time job maybe it makes you uh do you know do a side project um or maybe you even want to quit or maybe you have your own startup right now but you uh you're just looking to take it to the next level so um thank you for tuning in this has been fun and uh subscribe to the YouTube least you can do uh if you enjoy this and comment uh comment something because I read every comment I read every comment and uh share this pod if you enjoyed it um so cheers to you and uh have a good one later

I think this is the most underrated thing in the world for creators especially and anyone trying to make anything usually the best creators own one word or one specific phrase like Ryan holiday owns stoicism jao willink I think owns discipline what happens is you repeat this word every single day and then people just start seeing it everywhere cuz you know what it is when you give something a name it gives someone like a a lighthouse right until then it's just like air but when you give someone a name it becomes something they can go towards something they can visualize something they could stand by and so there's that piece there's like giving an actual name to your mission your lifestyle who you are whatever it is I have been looking forward to this one the most interesting man on the internet Zach pogb um and I have a confession to make I actually was going to cancel last minute this podcast recording uh because I woke up had a headache really wasn't feeling well but you talk about Obsession and I've been seeing all your videos about running and just going hard and sleeping on the floor floor and I looked in the mirror and I slapped myself in the face and I was like what would Zach do and of course I I you know I'm looking forward to this I'm not gonna cancel it right like I'm obsessed I want to make this podcast amazing I'm not going to cancel it so what did I do I had a couple double espressos popped a couple Advils worked out steam sauna cold plunge and then I just sat out side a little bit had a little breakfast for like 30 minutes just com and completely changed my morning and day and I I've been feeling feeling dope since so you inspired me let's go that that is the obsessed lifestyle it is UN optimization it is almost Embrace embracing when you don't feel perfect embracing when you don't have all the stacks all the cards uh stacked with you and using that as like motivation it's huge so good job Greg you're officially obsessed I appreciate it um so on this podcast we talk about different business ideas um and and different niches and Trends you prepared a few which I think are are fascinating um and I want to start with suffering as a service what do you mean by that yeah it's funny because it's almost like sass right it's like the same type of acronym I just think normal life has gotten so soft and easy you know Uber eats to your apartment go puff for deliveries um and that's why you see all these people doing you know tough modders Spartan races Ultra marathons people are craving that type of discomfort it actually makes them feel alive um even like these dark Retreats like in the last year I don't know about you but like five people I know are like oh yeah I just sat in darkness for a week to like find myself and like you can position that however you want that is suffering like in some way and it's like I think you can get really creative with that and I think it's a massive opportunity like as you have to imagine just normal life's just going to get easier and easier right we're going to have to do less and less so people will need more things like that and so like honestly it's a big part of what I'm doing like this run cult I just started this run Club it's kind of like shared suffering and I think that's why people like it can you talk about that like for for people who don't know like what is what is the Run cult and why do you think it's start it's taking off sure so yeah if you if you've been on like Instagram in the last year you've probably seen run clubs taking off kind of all around the country they're kind of like the new uh they're like just this new trend that's happening in all these cities because people are getting into running and I've been doing more and more running myself getting really into it over the last year have this audience you know biggest on Instagram and you know me and Hunter Weiss in the office were kind of talking like you know what type of community do we want there's so many of these and honestly last the week I launched it which was like three or four weeks ago it was one of those things I didn't even decid it till the morning of I'm just like I need to do this I came up with the perfect name the night before perfect branding run cult every run Club is called Club cult is like one letter off and a total different like meaning so it's just like it goes from being oh hey want to join this R Club run Club to hey want to join this run cult I just love it and yeah what it is is me and like 50 people every Monday morning meet we run through the streets of Manhattan in the morning at 7: a.m. we do Sprints at the end and it's great it was also the first time really testing like my audience with an inperson event um and it went really well it's pretty cool like for me it's it's not really about me and I kind of struggle with that we could talk about that too because I know you're a big Community guy but it was cool to like give people a chance to enter the world of obsession that I write about because that that's kind of what it is and it is suffering as a service in a lot of ways right 100% 100% we do Sprints no run Club does Sprints I literally make these people Sprint for the first time in probably a decade and they love it makes them feel alive and that's why they keep coming back um um yeah I've seen people talk about your run cult as sort of like a Fight Club 2.0 yeah I mean before I launched it I watched Fight Club every single night like 20 times in a row I'm I'm not joking just because I wanted like the principles and the ethos to be like in my brain um it's the same model it's like project madman in Fight Club if you've seen the movie it's like start this thing where people you know they have never seen the side of themselves and now people like around the country are starting run Cults kind of like what happened with Fight Club um I don't know it's uh it's cool and what's the business of of the cult like how do you do you plan on monetizing it yeah so I plan on monetizing what I'm doing in the running space as a whole is like very partially money driven like I want to build real companies in the space and that is 100% a part of my vision but I'm not thinking about that yet really um I think there's a lot of opportuni like I think getting like I said like 50 people totally aligned on a mission wearing all black in Manhattan is special there's a lot of different ways to monetize that but overall it's more just like it's a huge piece of the world right the world I'm trying to build and um I don't know I think there'll be really cool opportunities this year with it in terms of collaborations obviously could do products and merch but I think and we could talk about this more I think the running space as a whole is massively wide open and so that's where I think I'll make a lot of moves over the next year too so so if you if you wanted to monetize it what sort of ideas would you have for it yeah one idea would be races I think that'd be fun so there's there's one kind of organization doing this but they just kind of suck at social media and so do like these uh put on races and charge you know a certain amount of money that would be okay I don't know if you'd make a ton ton of money from that probably make more money doing just like really great quality merch with it could do that could host events I don't know like I haven't really thought about it that much so Rafa do you know Rafa the cycling it's a cycling apparel company it's a bit highend and basically the idea is um you buy their merch but they also have a yearly community and you can pay like I don't know what it is I think it's like $50 a year or something and you pay for that and you get access to their like London New York SF uh cycling events and meetups so it's like there's these communities you join them and you you know you get to race and obviously you're going to you're not going to show up to a Rafa IRL Meetup wearing a Nike shirt you're G to wear Rafa so I think the combination of like I could see you just especially because of the Black by the way I'm wearing black for you I was wearing gray before and I was like something's off here I need to just throw to change real quick that's why I was late um and so I think that's a good I you know the fact that I put on black right now like if I had an obsessed sweater I would you know I'd be wearing it right now yeah I uh I cut you cut out for a second so you said it that that brand it's like a clothing brand at its core but they host is a type of membership where you get access to these races yeah I think the so my better answer is like I I've kind of thinking as the run cold as this here's how I'm thinking about the running space right now for me in terms of monetizing it's run cult is one piece right there's a mass opportunity I think in apparel right like I I'm starting to do these races now and I can't find anything I like can't find any Brands I like to wear just because of like the ethos of The Branding and the Styles um so there's that piece and then the third piece is like coaching I think one of my like most viral Tweets in the last year was every guy I know who's lifted for the last five years is getting into running now Ed it is true every single one of them so like there's like the Run cult the apparel and then some type of coaching branded around this coaching program app whatever um branded around this type of athlete and that's really how I'm thinking about it is so you've heard the term hybrid athlete right yeah like the Nick bear model kind of right yeah explain that for people because everyone knows that yeah so Nick bear you know was a Savage um you know he was uh he was in the army or Marines and he did Iron Man he did bodybuilding shows he's run freak marathons and he he would consider himself the hybrid athlete where you know he competes in strength competitions and and endurance comp competitions like running and marathons uh and that's become a huge thing on social media now people they do both they run and they lift I'm actually not interested in that at all like I have barely lifted in the last three months I I'm lifting a little bit but I'm a I'm a runner I a runner that's all I care about but I'm 200 pounds still I'm a big boy still relatively in the running space especially with like the times I'm doing and so I think there's a massive opportunity for me to build this new category of Runner where it's like 180 to 200 pounds a lot of them lifted for most of their like young adulthood but now they're getting into running and they need something to compete in right because I think like what Spartan does and what like have you heard of H rocks H rock is huge man H rock is like the the new CrossFit for hybrid athletes basically it's like it's been around a while but it's really blowing up like every every like Fitness influencer in Austin that I know is competing in this thing called high rocks anyway I think there's this new opportunity to build this category for these ex lifters becoming Runners to compete in doesn't really exist because these guys will never be Olympic marathoners they'll really never get to like a 230 Marathon which is really really really fast but they could still do something insane at their weight you know what I mean like I I genuinely think if I keep going in two years I'm going to be the fastest marathoner probably in the world between like 180 to 200 pounds maybe it's like a big goal but like I'll be up there and it would be sick if I could start this new category and like you said races things like that where it's designed for these types of people um I think that's a massive I think if you could create something that people dedicate their life towards that is unlimited monetization opportunities and and it's just sick totally and I think you're thinking about it the right way which is you're not forcing monetization like you that's the mistake a lot of people make is they they'll build a community they they'll build a movement and they'll start with monetization right away and it's just like you're building something special and and it it doesn't know it's a toddler you know it's not an adult it doesn't know what it wants to be yet and I think uh I like that I like that a lot that's a good analogy yeah well I think it's you you struck a chord like with this pain as a service um this idea around um a new category of Runner like the why now like it's very important to ask yourself like why now like why does this why should this movement exist and I think there's a lot of reasons why and I think if I were you I would be like okay how do I introduce as much pain as possible uh the next o over the next 12 months prove out New York City and the truth is like New York City pretty sure New York City has like more like a bigger GDP than Canada I believe you know so you know if you can make it there you can make it anywhere right so there's so much opportunity I think uh 10 plus million people um that I would just focus on pain and New York City uh like double down on the thing double down on the down like the thing the thing the thing that people like it for yeah that's the thing we kind of debate like the cult branding because it's so like divisive like we don't get that many girls at our run cult right and some of the guys like like girls I guess and it's like but I'm like no like that's the whole Magic of it it's like it is a cult it is hard um it wouldn't work if you changed the name so I like that I will more pain more pain to the world more pain more pain more Gain No I think uh I think there's there's so many sister brother painful ideas that you could apply um I was watching this thing there's a wild thing it's called This is especially true in like the ultra marathon game there I was watching this thing if you want to Google it it's a sick documentary called the Barkley marathons and I don't know how much you'll see on Google but it's it's a great documentary it's just this random dude in the middle of Tennessee puts on this 100 mile race right and to get through it you have you there's no Mount there's no route you make your own route and you have to collect like book pages from trees so you have to collect pages from books taped the trees to prove you've been on it it's wild so I think there's so much I could do with like like imagine like a darkplace ultramarathon series like I think that is going to stuff like that could be so cool I found uh I Googled it and the first thing thing that came up was a New York Times article that said life isn't fair he didn't want this race to be either I it reminded me of that uh it reminds me of the thing from uh did you ever see like that haunted house McKenzie Manor I think it's called or it's just this dude in like New Jersey who like people sign up to get tortured by him and it's just a dude in like a house anyway that's a that's another weird YouTube rabbit hole well I think the trend that you're talking about which is which is basically that people need to feel something corre um is is a really important thing to note you know I'm in a group chat and someone in the group chat this morning wrote I just bought some Bitcoin and ethereum and then someone else wrote why and then he writes just to feel something it's true I mean I feel like that's why people got so addicted to crypto it's like that that a few years ago it was just so emotional yeah yeah so I think like if you can start like if you can reverse engineer feelings like that's a a good prompt for how to create you know and you talk about this a lot a movement versus you know a business yeah I like that let's move to agencies on the back of creators what's interesting about that to you well I have one now it's pretty cool it's called vids it's mostly right now for the animations that I've done on my page kind of how I blew up my content last year I think I gained like 2 million followers in six months from making those animations just like crazy numbers uh and when it works well that model is sick for someone like me where you know you have talented operators um on the back end helping build it right like I've never built real real businesses yet built like small businesses so it's like trust them and um I think creators on it depends right I think creators either massively underestimate or massively overestimate the demand they have right and like I think I'm I was in like the underestimating camp like underestimating how much I made how many leads I drove from promoting something so it's like finding those creators who are underestimating it versus the overestimating right um because I think more and more creators would sign up for something like this to be fair maybe there's not that many but that have a big enough audience but I think there's still enough and I think if you can package a Creator's journey and Obsession into service it can be pretty cool so I still think it's a good opportunity how much how much does it cost to work with you like what is the product offering and and do you are you running the agency is my other question am I personally yeah no no there's an operator his name is Jordan running the whole thing um I'm involved still because it's still pretty new uh we have a few different tiers it's like I think the lowest is like 3500 up to like 7500 and then a little more if it if the package gets crazy um and yeah it's it's just like set video deliverables basically you get me involved as a creative director basically where I'm like looking over all the design because that's what I'm obsessed with and you also get like my system for script writing because in my opinion especially on short form the also I'm not trying to sell my agency right now it's just like this okay you're explaining it you're explaining it yeah I'm really not um there's a million need these agencies go work for go choose one that you like um the scripts on these videos are everything I genuinely think it's like 90% script writing for short form and really for content in general right but it's uh yeah that's what it is it's not complicated it's just uh you know trying to do there's a bunch of these agencies just trying to do a good job at it I think zero to a million dollars Revenue like it's a good cash flowing business maybe $2 million I think where these businesses get way more interesting is when they turn into some sort of software product so I'll give you an example not many people know this but who tweet which is a social media scheduling platform has raised hundreds of millions of dollars multi-billion dollar valuation actually came out of an agency called invoke so invoke was a social media agency in the mid 2000s when Twitter was just first coming out and they realized that their clients needed tweet schedulers so because they're working with social media uh clients they're just like okay let's just go build it for ourselves so we can use it with clients and then once they got like 20 clients using it all of a sudden they spun it out and then it became a separate business they raised hundreds of millions of dollars sort of the rest is history so I think with you and what you're doing I think like at the face of it Creator agencies is like I don't know somewhat interesting but what's more interesting is the insights that the creator has and the insights that the agency has so that you can productize that maybe it's software maybe it's not software it doesn't necessarily need to be software but some productization and people throw around the word producti Services I'm not talking about a producti service I'm talking about a productize scalable business so I think that's where you can take your business yeah I think you're right and I also think yeah you're right like as a whole the agency thing is probably overrated for most people um it's just cool for me which is why I'm talking I mean your friend I mean it's because you you have friends who who are in that space too right Hunter has an agency Henry and do now yeah we all do basically it's great um yeah you're right it's probably as a whole super overrated for creators but I think it's okay I think it's underrated for like operators I think it's a cool opportunity for like the operator to like start something cool that's what I think it's more the opportunity is better yeah start I like what you're saying like what you're saying about software though yeah yeah I like what you're saying that's definitely the vision that should be the vision if you uh if you were to create software for a video AG agency like what would you create um I mean I've wanted to create the software for since I started making these videos and I have some people who are trying it's just not doesn't exist yet it's just like Drop in a script and make an animated video if you want to make that you know message me um there's like people who can do like a 10% version of it um and it's probably pretty close with the AI stuff to be fair that would be like that would be the answer related to those videos yeah I feel like that idea is a huge idea which is basically it feels like every four or six months there's like a new format for short form video like and you've been to your credit like you've been always like feels like always inventing it or or popularizing it in a lot of way only like one or two only like one or two yeah only change the internet the history of the internet once or twice no big deal so I think that's what creators should be thinking about is like productizing that part of their brain um it's just harder it's just harder to build something like that oh yeah it's way harder but you get but you get better results yeah it and it's it's harder and there's less instant gratification like you could send out a tweet being like hey like you wouldn't do this but you could send out a tweet be like go to my landing page and book you know book me I've got two spots open for my video agency um and you would people would get that you know sign up in a second and you'd make money in a second it's way harder to like build a suite of software hire like talented people people invest a bunch of money and and charge $50 a month uh that is way sicker though if you can do it I I agree yeah so something for for folks to to think about um this was an interesting idea that you have um the mider mid-tier creators passion fruit for bet but better what did you mean by that have you used that platform at all do you know about it yeah I've used the platform I don't mean the [ __ ] on them but it's actually great and I've made money through the platform but like it's kind of it felt kind of unusable like I um it's just like SL uh what's the right word it's like uh chunky it's like hard to use quickly um I feel like so the mid- tier of creators right these people are getting a good amount of inbound for sponsors and collaborations right they're not getting you know $100,000 deals but they're getting you know a few every week interested or a few every month they can make you know a living let's say like a good living from sponsorships but they have no idea what they're doing this was basically me all last year right and I had to figure it all on my own I think there's an opportunity there I feel like now I'm kind of going Beyond not to be like cocky I think I'm slowly getting like away from that category to where like now I'm talking with like bigger companies and bigger deals and I have people helping me but this like mid- tier I don't know how exactly you define it with metrics it depends on the platform but I like passion fruit but better passion fruit but it works like I think that's a massive opportunity helping creators like productize and um not productize but like uh package with their offerings um I think it's a big opportunity I mean a lot of people are trying to help me with it sort of and uh not necessarily the creators but the operators to like go in and build those businesses yeah and this probably this here's here's a product I would love which is I would love to be a part of a group maybe it's less than 50 people but a group of creators and operators like invite only and have having like a team moderate to like connect let's say you know Zach with you know someone from hey it's like hey let's do a partnership with Shopify and like we did this thing for Mr Beast let's so do for you you know like where does that exist like where does you know what I mean you're saying The Operators The Operators for uh the brands yeah yeah yeah it doesn't really exist and that's like this is what I'm saying it should something like this should exist I'm kind of talking with some people who are doing something like this it's just like uh yeah it's interesting it's a good opportunity I think yeah if you can do it though you need you need to get connected with these people and it's hard yeah it's hard takes time and the trust isn't necessarily there that's why like I love the idea of having some person in the middle of it sort of like moderating it you know passion fruit is interesting in the sense that like it's self serve anyone can go on there and you kind of you can book sponsorships like we use it for we have a newsletter called you probably need a robot.com and for AI productivity and people book ads and like just it's awesome for us you know but we don't have people being like pitching us like oh hey you should you know do merch and you know what I mean like so I think having someone in between and connecting could be really interesting so I do think that there's something on this idea dude I got to ask you uh I listen to the founders podcast so I I heard you uh spoke to David senra and I want to know what he told you oh yeah that uh this great piece of advice he did a show in New York it was awesome and we hung out for a second before it yeah you gave me this piece of advice that I've given to like a dozen people when they want to start something it's like let's say you're a Creator or you're an entrepreneur and you want to build this thing right you have this list of like the five things that you should probably do like if you're a Creator that's like you know get your beehive newsletter it's like get a course going get um you know get a car ourself for Instagram like all this stuff right that is so like this next the typical next steps but usually the creators who have outlier success ignore all of those and they go do something else that's unique so it's like the advice from him is like take the five things that most people would do in this situation ignore them completely like actually write them down ignore them completely and then go do something else more unique and better think that's great advice to like stand out it's so simple and tactical yeah and I'm not surprised he has such good advice cuz like he literally studies the world's best people exactly he's great like you know you know the advice he gave me actually because we were talking about monetizing for me um the other piece of advice he gave me which was great when I was asking him yeah how should I make money from like my community the obsession stuff he's like just build a cult that's what he said and he was right and that's literally what I did with the running so it's like I didn't really understand what he meant at the time but now I do so yeah I feel like it's so bothered just to be like you ask a question expecting like a f you know a 1 Hour podcast response and he just says like a several words words and but you know he's the type of guy he's a smart dude he like he that was all I needed I actually kept that was actually the best answer um yeah I'm glad he didn't say anything else totally yeah I need I needed to I need to understand that so one person that you actually surfaced to me is a guy named Sam suik um and ever since I saw your Tweet on him it's just changed how I've seen the inter internet basically because I see it everywhere yeah I was pretty relatively early to him like I think I shouted the out like summer and now it's like you see him every day constantly every day what uh for folks who don't know about him maybe explain a little bit and and tell us why you think it's interesting and there's a trend around it yeah sure so he he's like a 20-year-old bodybuilder in Ohio just ridiculously jacked probably Juiced up uh almost definitely Juiced up um on steroids and over the last year he or in 2023 he went from like zero to I don't know what's he at two million subscribers on YouTube posting a long form video of him working out every single day and basically the reason it's caught the internet's attention is one obviously the growth but two is the type of content which is polar opposite to one it's polar opposite in many ways which usually is how you get these outlier results one is it's the opposite of all Fitness content Fitness content bodybuilding content became all about Lamborghinis and influencers and cars he just went the total opposite way I'm recording on a shitty iPhone that's cracked I don't care about clothing I don't care about anything I don't care about money I just want to lift and then number two is compared to YouTube content which is the Mr Beast this is the thumbnail the optimization it's just nope here's me um on a broke my iPhone's taped to a broken tripod um I'm just talking to the camera one take no edits totally un unedited and unoptimized and because of that it was exactly what people wanted and uh you know I've put out a bunch of tweets about him because he's really inspiring what I'm doing now with the video and uh what I'm trying to do and it's like yeah it's incredible to me what he's doing I think though and I think it's he honestly is like part of this shift happening in content now towards that raw authentic style but for most people doing that will be really really hard it's even it's happening on Instagram too like you're putting out more handwritten notes on Instagram and I think that's resonating with people more um I put out some handwritten notes uh you talking about like the post with like the handwritten style yes yeah yeah even yeah that's you're right that's kind of an example of it it's more authentic than um you know it's so for example with those before that I was just doing like tweets it was it would show my Twitter and it would show my text which is what most people do and it's insane how much better the handwriting performs dude I I literally if people aren't watching this or they're listening to it you need to watch the Youtube cuz like I just saw like the light bulb go off in your brain which is like oh my God he's right it the handwritten thing is more amate you know is the more amateur type thing there's actually two things there it's it's it is more amateur and authentic also I don't handwrite those it's it's actually just like a font but anyway it's that and it's also removing your Tweet for Instagram this is like a tactical thing that might be useful I think removing your Twitter thing is so useful because Instagram posts especially text they get shared they grow from people sharing on their stories and most people don't want to share a quote with someone's little face and Twitter at they want to share just text so if you like think about that logically it makes a lot of sense however it's hard because from a design perspective they're more used to seeing in okay this is a whole another thing but like the design of text posts on Instagram is super important and it's how I've grown my stuff and it's like you have to make something that people can recognize instantly and you want the words to hit their brain instantly right so it's like for a tweet they instantly know what that is and it versus a handwriting post if you choose the wrong font or the wrong style you're [ __ ] and they're not going to be able to read it they're just going to scroll so it's like you have to make the handwriting style as easy to read as the Tweet anyway side tangent no good tangent a lot of people listening including me are trying to figure out how to grow their Instagram I'll tell you a little a little something I'm curious your perspective I decided this week to go Rogue and I had an agency basically running my Instagram they would clip Up This pod occasionally I would like do a direct camera thing and they' post they post it on Instagram and on YouTube shorts and I didn't love how do I say this respectfully um it was ma me no it's just if I'm gonna do something I'm going to do it obsessively in your words that's the only way to grow on social media I think that's the only way to actually grow is to be completely obsessed with it and the reason I grewed a 600 thou uh sorry 360,000 followers on Twitter was because I was obsessed with the content and I shared at the time and still to this day I try to share a unique point of view and take people behind the scenes and with Instagram specifically and YouTube shorts I don't know and it's just being honest with yourself I don't know at this point how to use that short form form um like cut up long form to make it work on short form like I to me I just I felt like that was a moment in time I don't know what are your thoughts like if you were me do you think it's a mistake that I you know I'm not doing Clips short form Clips so you're not going to do any or you're saying you're going to do a different I'm just I'm gonna double down on long form that's basically what I'm saying I'm doubling down on I think I think that's smart that's kind of what I'm trying to do ra right I'm trying to take my Instagram audience to YouTube yeah um I I don't think that's wrong I think it's hard to do what you were saying which is like take a long form piece of content like a podcast and put it into a real it's hard like you're going to post a 100 clips and maybe one goes viral and others just get ignored because people are tired of seeing podcast Clips in their feed yeah right they are so it's like I think the better way to do it is just like figure out uh content specific right like Twitter you were just making tweets and that's why they did good threads and uh so yeah I don't know I'm a big fan like for Instagram like the way I view my stuff I want to have like the the pretty highly produce like edits of me like running or the animations and then on the other side almost 50/50 have just me talking to the camera no editing right I think that's a good way to do it but know I think you have the right mentality long form is I mean look I'm I'm in a unique situation I only made short form content really written content for like four years and then started doing video and then after like a month of doing video my life has completely changed so like you know I'm all in on the long form stuff yeah I I I like long form too I've also just noticed the people that listen or watch to watch long form are high quality people um like one high quality like connection with you too it's like yeah that's what I mean different completely different like such a it's so like so many people reach out watch YouTube or listen to the podcast and I just I want more of those people the way I've been explaining to people what I'm going through and I think you understand this too it's like your short form stuff builds trust especially when you do it for years right you get a lot of trust by posting every day and showing up but once you take that to a long form medium you get the connection and the connection stacks on on top of that trust and it is absolutely insane right so yeah I'm with you yeah awareness and Affinity that's that's how I describe it short fir is great for awareness and Affinity is uh is what you call it like the connection and and yeah like an analogy analogy I used the other week sorry to interrupt you is like short form is like short form is like passing someone on the street maybe say hi for a second but it's a short interaction and long form is like sitting down with them for dinner it's like oh you're really getting to know them now um Dylan Dylan even had a better analogy with that he's like Dylan Jordan he's like yeah short form is you know on the street you don't choose it it just happens to you kind of like short form scrolling on a feed but long form you're choosing to meet someone you're clicking on a video it's totally different yeah super intentional and um so I think prediction more more creators go long form is that is that what you're thinking creators and especially writers right like I think um like I think Danny Miranda put out this tweet how all these writers are now doing video including myself yeah I think like the I WR wrote how the other I think the online writer staple like that's like kind of a meme now kind of like a on Twitter I think it's so overdone and overrated for almost everybody and like you can't make any money with it and you can't build a real brand and you can't build a real trust with your audience unless you're this super unicorn which is like five people and instead I think I mean depends what you want to do but like well explain that a bit I'm curious like what do you mean by that why can't online writers do well on the internet monetize well on the internet I guess they can I just think it's hard I think it's hard and I think I don't think people are good enough writers I don't think most people are interesting enough like I said I think for the unicorns you can but like look at even someone like Dan Co right Dan Co is monetized pretty well but I think a large piece of that is from his videos he's crushing on YouTube and that's why people connect with him right it's like he I wouldn't even call him an online writer he's a kind of a he's a writer and a YouTuber right sells writing courses but he's basically a YouTuber it's like so that's what I mean it's like yeah there is like the Tim urbans of the world and the James clears of the world but outside of them there's think about the ones who build real businesses off of just their writing sure there are some newsletter guys like that I'm ignoring for sure but like for the kids starting up even me who has [ __ ] like two million followers from writing I don't really I have followers that I I most my followers came from taking my writing and putting it into videos right so even though that's why I have this thing I I've repeat over and over to people it's like strict with the message flexible with the medium it's like I just want to I this is me though I don't want to just be a writer that's why I'm out here running marathons like I want to be I want to do more more than one thing um I want to build Brands I want to do that stuff and for me to do that I think I have to build my world of obsession into every single medium and so it's like take the core that works the writing and put it into these new packages uh I don't know for me that's really exciting and I think that that's how I'm going to do everything yeah so like I said it depends on your goals but I just think for most people it's overrated I guess my realization with all this is doing multiple formats at the same time is very very difficult so you have to learn one first kind of you have to like really get one first yeah yeah it's one at a time like my mistake was I did I I was like oh I'm an online writer you know I write on Twitter and I have a newsletter I could easily do podcast short form long for you know long form like a bunch of other platforms you know Tik Tok Instagram shorts at the same time and it took some awareness to basically be like no like that that's actually a bad idea like go what like and I love that flexible with the format is that what you said flexible with the format yeah that that's what I did last year to make it super tactical last year I didn't have those videos right the animated videos that got hundreds of millions of views and I didn't have Obsession as a brand so at the same time I basically was like all right I'm going to commit to this one message but I'm going to be super flexible with the medium that I use to get the message in front of more people and that is like a thing that I don't think anyone does and and if you most people don't do either but when you do both what it got me is a ton of new new fans and a ton of actual true fans who will you know put Obsession in their bio and come to my run cult it's like that's like one of my favorite ideas I've came up with that like strict with the message flexible with the medium I think and you you've talked to me about I remember when we met in New York last year about the importance of having owning a word can you talk more about that yeah I think this is the most o underrated thing in the world for creators especially and anyone trying to make anything it's like the best people are constantly owning well what usually the best creators own one word or one specific phrase right like Ryan holiday owns stoicism jao willink I think owns discipline or or maybe leadership also he might own both of those um I think it's an extremely powerful way to build a brand because what happens is you repeat this word every single day and then people just start seeing it everywhere that's like a there's like a a scientific phrase for that where and uh especially on like Twitter it's an EMP powerful it's a very powerful brainwashing platform like that's all I'm doing every day is like brainwashing people to believe in Obsession and I think it's working you can do it Tastefully though where like I don't know you still follow me right like I'm not that annoying like it's like you can do it without being annoying um and I just think it's cuz you know what it is when you give something a name it gives someone like a a lighthouse right until then it's just like air but when you give someone a name it becomes something they can go towards something they can visualize something they could stand by something they could put in their bio like like mine um and so there's that piece there's like giving an actual name to your mission your lifestyle who you are whatever it is and then there's also like like I think you should be trying to name everything you do right like the names are like the nodes that let people share your ideas without that how do your ideas get shared it's basically impossible you're pretty good at this you're actually really good at it you're always coming up with [ __ ] like uh what is it like multipreneur um you're great at naming and so it's like you get it but a lot of people don't get this and the challenge is it's very I think very very very hard and it takes a long time yeah how do you how do you uh how do you come up with the name a good one you have to put out a ridiculous amount of stuff and wait until it's completely obious VI that's the only answer I think you have to wait until it's obvious in that other people love it you love it and no one else owns it and then there's also the thin line of you want a name that is super you know unique that you can still own it but rare enough that um sorry unique enough that you can own it but common enough that it's still in culture right like obsession is all over culture it's behind all these guys like you know Kobe and um all these people so it's like that balance so it's those three things you love it they love it and no one else has it it super hard but when I felt it it was obvious I I started like the obsession movement after a run it just hit me like oh my God this is obvious I need to tweet this like who is obsessed put a Black Flag if you're obsessed put a Black Flag in your bio and across Twitter and Instagram like thousands of people did it I didn't plan that there was no planning yeah I had like I had followup session in my bio for like a year so it was like it was ruminating but it was just boom obvious and did it and it was a good choice um so that's what I'd say it's like start paying attention to the I just said it like those three things so it's so important and that's why I think you're going to I I believe my prediction Zach you're gonna be a household name in 10 years because 10 years that it's a good timeline that's 10 years like you can beat I want to do it uh is that your goal too something like that I don't know I I I think that we're talking about you right now you know I think that I just we could race let's ra Let's Race until we're on Oprah okay is that is that the bar I I think that when you when you pick a category of one and you name the category which is what you're doing and you consistently know how to leverage social platforms to create progress and you show up every day as long as you're healthy I just don't see how you don't make Obsession every obsessed person's like Mission and and they're GNA want to play it I saw a really good tweet by um Pascal Da Silva and he said we need more Walt Disney less Elon musks um who is that who tweeted that Pascal the Silva front of yeah uh that's a good tweet it's a good tweet it like I think yeah I think it only got like a a few likes check it out you know check it out yeah cuz I mean that's exactly what I'm trying to do like at the core of dis I've everyone seen the Disney map if you're listening to this probably with all the different connected parts of their business at the core was just like what was it like animation films right and at the core of mine is World words about Obsession it's what I've done literally since day one and will never stop doing and as long as I do that right it will feed everything um I love that yeah I love that yeah I mean I think that's the thing it's like when you stick to this one word it compounds in the most insane way right because uh people instantly understand you who you've never met and so they can expl you really easily and that creates all these opportunities that happen behind you that you never see it's like oh this is Zach he's Obsession he's just trying to build the world of obsession everyone gets it instantly and uh like I've only been doing that for like really a year so like imagine five years imagine 10 uh it's a it it compounds it compounds quick you're right the word of mouth on owning a word is is massive it's especially massive when you live in New York City and you're connected with other people who are connected um you know a lot of people say like oh um okay I'll just put it out there I I mostly work remote but I think that if I lived in New York City or I lived in San Francisco you know my movements would probably go quicker and also I I I should I should say that your friend group is an obsessed friend group from what I from what I've seen Dylan Henry yeah like all those guys right yeah we basically live in the office it's it's great yeah I mean you live the lifestyle I think that if you're going to own a word whatever word you're going to own you need to live that lifestyle yeah I mean that's the most important part like I have I have this like path of obsession I've written about a little bit it's like the the seven steps that these guys like Arnold Disney they all go on and uh I'm very much living it I'm like I'm like almost halfway on it and I have to that's the only way it works but the way this really works is this is actually important on only a name the reason it's actually so important is it lets you build something bigger than you which is why people get follow follow in the first place it's because they're doing something bigger than themselves no one wants to hear people preach no one wants to hear people who make it all about them this like I I made this 20 tweet the other day I was running and this girl stopped me on the street and she just screams at me obsessed and keeps walking and I said I wonder if that girl even knows who I am I wonder if she even knows my name or if she just knows Obsession I bet you there's a good chance she doesn't even know my name she just remembers following me and seeing like Obsession this Obsession that think about that right think about that that is also I don't get recognize that much so like that was crazy and it's a perfect example it's like it gives you this thing to build that's not you anymore it doesn't even have to be a brand like I don't monetize Obsession really yet not not really so it's like that is a super important but like subtle but really important piece to it yeah it's mind share you're owning you're owning the Mind share of obsession it's worth a lot of money who else out there owns a word or owns a movement that you look up to just curious um it's tough uh like the ones I said before are big examples uh Ryan holiday Joo is kind of like my role model for how he built his businesses um just quick mention like he crushed the art and he crushed the business um one guy on Twitter is great uh this guy C bra you ever see him no Colton he's great he's like one of these Twitter guys like OG Like Money Twitter I think I think he is he might not like me calling him that but he I to me he kind of owns the he to me kind of owns the word like Misfit kind of talks about like um all these boxers like eating like [ __ ] before their fights and still crushing it like I love that I to me he kind of owns the word Misfit um I don't know there's um let me think who comes to my brain quickly okay I think of cold tubs I think of that guy on Instagram who does it every day and like smashes the thing with the dumbbell I think of him he's kind of owning cold tubs to me I think of uh I think of wealth I think of sahill I think he's trying to own that word that might just be from him like texting me that but I think he's doing a good job there like um I don't know that's sah Bloom for for people who yeah he's he's first name basis yeah we're on the first name basis exactly there's two there's two types of people in this world there's people who call Mr Beast Mr Beast and there's people who call Mr Beast Jimmy which one are you listener exactly that's fun yeah um I want to end with this and I want you to be real with me what what's keeping you up at night what are you fearful of and try to be as honest as you can so okay what am I fearful of that's like the real question right yes because I'll give you a second to think about it like from the outside and I love following you from the outside it looks like this guy has everything together he's doing all the right things he's building up these assets he's building a category of one he's in this cool friend group you know he's living in New York City he's at the center of it but what what's really keeping you up at night what do you fear um it's definitely not that does it look like that I guess it kind of looks like that I've tried to be more open with how like Reckless my life is though like I I did like sleep in the office for like two weeks um because I had to and uh what's actually keep keeping me up at night is YouTube because I'm not sleeping that much because of it I'm getting better now though that was like a rough two weeks the fear for me is two things I think it's one I choose the wrong opportunities to build first right because like now it's basically like all right what do I build first that's really like the question it's I choose the wrong opportunities and it messes up like what I'm building that scares me um I don't know number two is I guess I burn out cuz like I I genuinely unlocked like a new part of myself like about four weeks ago five weeks ago for a lot of reasons and uh one was like starting the daily videos just like committing to something extreme like that was like exactly what I needed like unlock like a new part of me so I think the Fe there is a fear of like burning out if like I can't keep going but I don't think that will happen I feel like that's like this is not Obsession you don't burn out I don't know this is just me being honest I'm afraid of getting hurt if I get hurt I can't really do the running thing which is going to be like that's like a massive part of like everything I want to build over the next 5 10 years that will be hard it's really like the first thing I think is this the biggest worry right now I'm still trying to figure it out like I need to make more money to like build make the stuff I want to make it's like that simple like I want to hire a videographer right now A videographer is not free so like I have to go get that money somewhere it's like how do I go get that money um it's like doing the right things because I think I said yes to Opportunities last year right and especially in terms of like brand sponsorships that really put me back in terms of like I had this compounding thing going right with my content and it just like just like stopped me and uh so yeah that's the fear I think on on the money piece I I once heard this concept called mailbox money that I like using which is how do you have a project or a set of projects that every sing you know every day every week every couple weeks you just have your bills paid for so that you can do the the thing that you really want to be doing it hits the mailbox every single day every single week I love that I didn't I've never had that really I have that with the agency now that's kind of like why I want to start it um yeah so I think yeah I think you're going to start to I think you're starting to see a lot more people interested in cash flow portfolio of cash flowing businesses um AI is definitely going to if it speeds up software creation which it is I think there's tons of opportunity to create mailbox money projects and that's like case in point who owns the term mailbox money right I never heard the term it's it's so great though that should be a book 100% that should be a book on building those uh on you should build it maybe it's like you should make it that should totally be a that should be a book or a course you should go take that did you come up with that someone once told me it uh it's your the person the person the person that told me it I'll give credit is the actually co-founder of hoote Dario Melly he he was the one he was like I was telling him about a project I was involved in and how it was just like paying me monthly and kind of like covering my bills and he was like oh you talking about mailbox money I was like what are you talking about mailbox money I was like no no no it's like it's like this like project and and he's like yeah yeah it covers your bills you don't have to worry about you know your bills yeah it's amazing I never really had that in my life I always sold like my first business was like a basically a service people only book once which is like kind of the worst type of service mailbox money is the goal mailbox money is sick yeah and I think for a lot of folks their full-time job is their mailbox money true and the problem is it's difficult I don't know about you but it was hard for me like I I had a job you know when I've had jobs in my life it was hard for me to like create projects on top of it um like if I'm working like I obsessed like you and I if I'm if I'm working on something I'm Allin so it's hard to like do a lot of side projects um so I think that's the tough part about having a job yeah I never had a job but probably because I'm obsessed I would rather just have like no money and like not sleep and have a job but yeah I don't know that's just me not saying I recommend it people who have jobs mailbox money is possible but difficult um and I think 2024 year of mailbox money um Zach thank you for taking the time and for coming on the show thank you that was fun we ripped some some good ideas in there hopefully maybe yeah absolutely I think yeah people let us know Post in the in the YouTube comments if you if you liked any of the ideas um or if you have any ideas for uh one words that you want to own and uh where could people get to know you a little bit more best place to get to know me is my YouTube uh just Zach pogb you could probably find it by searching that and uh that's you know I'm doing a video every single day this year trying to make them all long form they mostly have been like over like 10 minutes um but my biggest platform is Instagram pretty active on stories there lately um Zach pogb and Twitter Twitter is like my favorite platform though for like you know the the cult I'm trying to build and like just like like I said brainwashing like non-stop if you follow my Twitter it's very low chance you won't get obsessed um so take that as a warning but yeah I think uh everyone should go follow th follow you there not just to be interested in in the great content you're putting up but also like to me you're building like the blueprint for how so many brands are going to be created in the future and how so many I think there's going to be like a Zach PO for X it's worth studying and it is funny like no creators not interrupt you like very few people are doing the name thing and I just think it's so important totally blows me blows me away you do it you're like one of the only ones um because I love names I love names it's the best dude coming up with names is the best [ __ ] game ever and only people who do it understand it but it is an infinite game it never ends and is so hard yeah yeah yeah it's it's definitely underrated uh a good name is totally underrated and I I tweeted this recently which is premium domains are actually underrated in my opinion I think so too yeah um we didn't need to buy multipreneur decom but we did because it was just like it's just sick I get sick it makes your brand look sick it's like yeah yeah I don't know I'm a fan and the other thing about premium domains uh quick quick tactical thing for folks is that you can lease them a lot of them so you know if you find a domain that you really like and you're like I don't want to I can't afford $50,000 for this domain a lot of them you can go and offer them hey I I can pay you $1,000 a month or $1,500 a month so heard that that's that's smart yeah yeah all right man I'll catch you I'll catch you in New York let's go stay obsessed

I believe that curation is like a superpower in today's internet for most people creating content is actually not the best service that they can provide to society it is curating the best ideas from the top 1% creators there are certain creators who I really respect and follow like for example I read everything that Ben Thompson writes I read everything that Matt LaVine writes as interesting to me what I'm listening to is the thought I have in my head of like what is going into their body what is informing their views what are the interesting things they're reading and consuming such that they're outputting these ideas and so like this is like a bigger swing that's like an idea I haven't seen but I would love a world where basically curation as a service becomes a thing Alex liberman co-founder morning Brew lover of ideas lover of business ideas so you're in the right place welcome to the show thanks I am quite the the Hopeless Romantic around business ideas but I'm excited to be jamming with another hopeless romantic about business ideas yes so one of your ideas really got me thinking Sports Illustrated I had heard that name in a while tell me tell me your Sports Illustrated idea yeah so Sports Illustrated has um unfortunately like a a checkered recent history um Sports Illustrated I believe is owned by I always get it wrong because there's so many companies involved in this but there's basically Arena group and there's authentic Brands and authentic Brands I believe owned Sports Illustrated and they had given the license to Arena group for some period of time to use the Sports Illustrated name and and build the company and long story short things broke down and Sports illustrated's in entire staff was laid off so the entire staff of sports illustrator was laid off so which to me tells me there's now this entire repository of content created over the years from Sports Illustrated there's a ton of emails of people who clearly have opted into caring about sports and sports information and so you know I am sure right now that the owners of Sports Illustrated authentic are probably shopping Sports Illustrated shopping the license to the highest bidder but I think it's going to take a very specific type of company to kind of revive the brand cuz like to me Sports Illustrated peaked in the 9s maybe the 2000s and it's kind of lost relevancy in the internet age and I just think there's such a massive opportunity to build like the great daily Sports newsletter right like this was something that Kendall Baker had um first with sports internet then he sold to axios he had axio sports for a while he just left and he's running Yahoo sports's newsletter but I don't think there's like the goto daily Sports newsletter and I think to have a head start with sports illustrated's list whether or not I would even have to use the brand like it's actually kind of irrelevant to me like if I could just get the list by the list even if it's not tied to the Sports Illustrated name and I don't have to pay a ton for the license I think there's just a great morning Brew for sports that can be built especially if you have a head start with a massive Corpus of emails for people who care about following Sports on a daily basis so I'm surprised you said that so I'm surprised that you you just buy the list like you're open to buying the list why I don't know to me you seem like a a brand guy and I could see I could see how you would be kind of like a hopeless romantic also for Brands and I could I could have the conversation could have gone like this could have been like you know I remember when I was 12 years old and I used to be you know I was in my childhood bedroom yeah and I'd be reading Sports Illustrated and I had such a connection with the brand and it was you know the beacon of the beacon of sports and I I'm missing that feeling and the brands diluted yeah it's it's funny uh now you're now you're having my brain go about how for the longest time I wanted to bring back dunkaroos uh because dunkaroos were not for a long time the product wasn't being created and if you wanted to buy dunar I remember this in college um my mom literally had to order boxes of dun from Canada because it was the only place in the world that you could buy dunkaroo from and I had massive boxes in my ding room and I always thought about what if I bought dunar and just brought back the brand look I think that there is absolutely value 100% there's a ton of brand Equity to the Sports Illustrated name I'm also just I guess trying to be realistic about what you probably have to pay for the license for that brand like I would assume it's a non uh nominal amount of money so if money wasn't a factor of course I'd love to have something that is like the daily newsletter from Sports Illustrated because you can kind of draft off the brand Equity but I guess let's just assume I had to pay Seven figures for an annual license for the Sports Illustrated name to be able to use their list or let's say I could spend $50,000 to buy their emails I feel way better about being able to build uh convince an email list of qualified Sports Junkies about the quality of a product I put out by hiring a badass newsletter writer than I do about having to in a year basically from scratch build a business that's doing at least seven figures just to cover the cost of the license so I in theory I I like it I just feel like it would cost a lot more to have to license it out but I could be wrong because I haven't done a licensing deal before so if I were to if I were to do that deal if I what I would do would be I would come up with a pitch called Sports really ill sportsillustrated.com and I would knowing that there's so much turmoil in this asset I would contact someone on authentic Brands I would cold DM them get a meeting and I would say yeah I'll pay you x amount of dollars for this license for this newsletter and it's it's the concept is it's kind of like what pom's doing with Bay Area times like the visual newsletter it's a it's a visual newsletter for sports junkies I I like that by the way where I see another opportunity here is I think a lot of people in like old media don't understand the kind of the value of attaching a media brand to um a non-media company to provide top of funnel for it so like I'd also if I wanted like a quick way to monetize this I'd hit up someone I would hit up companies that I think would benefit a ton from the Sports Illustrated list and their top of funnel whether it's a sports betting company whether it's a sports memorabilia company Etc I'd get them interested and then I would try to help broker the deal between basically what happened between HubSpot and the hustle uh or you know bar stool and Pen what does that look like in the context of Sports Illustrated and how can I broker this in a way where like maybe authentic isn't thinking about positioning the brand in this way what do you think's going through authentic Authentics mine right now cuz for folks who don't know like authentic Brands is is huge I just checked their revenue they do 21 billion a year Revenue I didn't realize this but they own Reebok they own Forever 21 they massive they're massive so it's a conglomerate um and they're probably looking at this and this just being like this is a thorn in side that's what I was goingon to say I think they're just like this is I think this is the equivalent of a VC who invests in a business that uh at some point you realize the business is not going to be their fund returner and they're like now I need to sit attend their board meetings do all these things and it's never going to be the thing that's actually worth my time I think that is probably how they're looking at it which actually to that point means there could be an opportunity just like to to be a headache remover for them and going back to you know acquiring newsletters you obviously have a lot of experience in this space how do you go about you know thinking about framework for what's the right price for a newsletter yeah by the way one just thing I would say here is like this I'm using the example of Sports Illustrated but but there's a similar kind of approach I would take with other companies and the approach here is like I always talk about this idea of the Hub and spoke model of just like latching onto hubs that already have access to built-in distribution so you don't have to start from day one right that's what you would do with latching onto Sports Illustrated email list but I think there are so many companies that don't re still it's crazy to me but still don't realize the value of email and even if they do realize the value of email they they have not taken the step of putting a ton of work into making email a true destination product and monetizing it effectively so I'll just use an example for you like um epic gardening have you heard of Epic gardening of course okay so I was talking to Kevin from epic gardening and epic like they yeah explain explain what it is explain what is yeah yeah so epic gardening is basically like the go-to YouTube channel for green thumbs for people who are into gardening and learning everything about uh the process of gardening techniques products right like the what's really interesting about epic gardening's business is I I don't know if their numbers are public so I'm not going to say them but basically it's a you know uh multi-million dooll business that does monetize through advertising and the way they monetize through ads is the Epic Garden website uh the Youtube channel um and but so like it's all through like they have sponsored content uh through the media asset but actually the way they make the majority of their money is through product sales Uh Kevin and epic gardening bought a seed company that they sell through their channels and so they do both direct to Consumer but they also sell their Seeds Wholesale and that was part of kind of like the thesis that churnin who's invested in a lot of these right like kind of Niche passion area media companies goes into the deal with which is like you have a passionate audience how do we build kind of like this content to Commerce model so anyway that's epic gardening their YouTube channel has um three million subscribers I believe and there by the way there's another kind of like side lesson we can or side quest we can go down of Kevin just launched a new YouTube channel and it is super uh on notal like super low edit him just talking to camera and it's grown to 15,000 followers in a few weeks and so it's interesting to see why like that is doing well but anyway epic gardening has 3 million subscribers and from talking to Kevin they have an email newsletter but I would say because they have a lot of other things going on um because email Isn't their expertise there's a ton of untapped potential in having a great daily or three times a week newsletter for the modern Gardener and I would love to explore a deal maybe epic is not the right brand to do it with because they've gone kind of the Venture route but what would it look like to re relaunch their newsletter as a daily newsletter for gardeners hire a great writer use the organic distribution strategies we use to grow morning Bruce they have three million YouTube subscribers like you should be able to get that list to 500,000 subscribers quickly and what would it look like to do a revenue share deal where I we basically are the ones driving the newsletter and we make money through some rev share that we drive on all ads or Commerce that comes from the newsletter like why aren't you doing this you know this sounds this is this to me this sounds like such a no-brainer it's like you're what you're talking about is morning Brew for X but partnering with a Creator and doing rev share um you know you did such hard work to as you know like the struggles of going zero to one and and it's like with the Creator in mind like this you it's easier the hard part is the Fulfillment which is how do you write the content how but like you know that like you know and and to me that's actually like that's that is where I could bring Advantage because I would say like it there was so much like Blood Sweat and Tears to figure out what makes a great newsletter writer what great makes a great newsletter in the early days but it's like you know I kind of understand the process now yeah so it's I think that's another interesting path as well say less say less my guy all right um we'll uh we'll table that one for bit authentic Brands let's see what happens there Canadian company so I have some I'm connection you know some connection there but I think I think someone is going to buy this and uh someone is going to do really well and and let's just end it with there's going to be a bunch of these opportunities um I've talked about on the show BuzzFeed is kind of a similar opportunity I'm curious before we end on this note what other similar type of companies have you seen where there's an opportunity to to get involved to be honest with you like it sounds bad but I think any Legacy Media brand that stands for something uh that is cutting head counter staff at bare minimum and closing their doors at maximum is an opportunity for this because I still have yet to meet a Legacy Media company that truly thinks about their newsletter as a destination because it was always an afterthought to driving site content or driving social views so like if it's actually like to me the exception to the rule would be some old school media company that's great with newsletter but I can't think of an example so whether it's rolling stone or uh you know what's the the name of the uh newspaper like Good Housekeeping or like like I think like actually Niche Legacy Brands could be as if not more interesting as like Creator Brands today because I think creators actually are like kind of more with it and understand the value of email I think Legacy Brands like actually still don't understand the value of email but they're just looking to get anything for their business right now because they're struggling so much and and I ALS and you know just to say I think there's a few reasons that like it's an interesting time to pick up undervalued Assets in media I think one is you have a number of and this has been happening for the last few years but still happening another a number of venture back media companies that were great businesses if they weren't venture-backed and are horrible businesses if they are venture-backed and I I think we've seen some of those already either have down rounds layoff staff shutdown Etc and I think you'll see more of those but then I think you're just also at an interesting time in kind of what I would call like traditional or mainstream media where there's less trust than ever before in mainstream monolithic uh media Brands uh the advertising market for the last year and a half has been absolute dog uh the to run one of these businesses they're so cost intensive they they run these businesses so fat and so I think you're just going to kind of continue to see this wave of businesses either cutting staff or closing doors altogether so basically put a Google alert for you know different media companies and layoffs and 100% And you know reach out to these people you'd be surprised like people are going to listen to this and be like no they're you easy for them to say you know they he started morning Brew of course they're going to open their email but like I don't know 15 years ago when I or 10 years ago when no one knew my name at all either and I would reach out to people and I would be surprised it's a numbers game yeah and by the way what I would say is like okay maybe for me it's going to a business and it's rejuvenating rejuvenating their email newsletter and doing a REV share on it by the way the way I think about this model is like it's basically the digital version of sushi BYU do you know do you know Sushi BYU's model no oh Su it's the most genius model so Sushi B that we have one there's a few in New York City uh it's it's like a high-end Omas chain um we have a few in New York City uh my wife and I live in Hoboken they just open one in Hoboken and their model is genius every Sushi B Bo is in a hotel and they go to a hotel and they say hey Hotel let's say your lobby is 3,000 F feet see the see those 250t in the corner of your lobby that right now has a chair and maybe a chest table let us let us build a sushi bar right there and what we're going to do is you're not going to charge us rent on it because you'd be doing nothing with that space as it is we're going to open the sushi bar we're going to mark it because we already have locations all over the country and we're going to do a REV share you're going to keep 20% of all revenue that we generate for the sushi bar we keep 80% and if it doesn't work out we leave your hotel and you have the unused Lobby that you had before if it does work out you've just automatically opened up a revenue stream you never had with your business and forget about the revenue stream it the cache that it adds exactly you have like an OM in your exact in your hotel I'm sure part of their pitch is yeah like look at what happens to your hotel prices when we put this in exactly so I think damn that's really good yeah that's really good and it's also just a reminder that you you know you you don't necessarily need to get inspiration from Twitter or podcast like the real world oh to yeah I like I mean this is talked about ad nauseum but I like I just just generally think the best inspiration is drawn not from the industry that you're in or the bubble that you're in it's like just literally pattern matching from another industry where something has worked and that was the thing I was going to say is like okay sure for Me Maybe I I have an unfair advantage to approach a business and relaunch their newsletter and open up a new Revenue stream for them but like that doesn't have to be the thing uh you know your thing is community you could go to a business and do the same thing of like let me assemble a community around your hardcore fans and we'll do rev share there it's like what is your core competency that can open up a new Revenue stream for a hurting business and approach them with an already existing plan what the Rev share is and I guaranteeing you they'll listen because they are desperate to listen yeah and basically everyone is hurting like if you're unless you're like an unless you're open AI you're you're looking for new Revenue sources y um so people are pretty uh open to these opportunities right now so and I don't know how you know interest rates might go down lower cheap money might come you know this might not be forever so I would suggest like Now's the Time totally um I want to move on to your Weight Watchers idea they're actually a a past client of our Innovation agency so uh there's only so much I could say but um yeah I'll I'll do the talking here and you can just react so I was just in Florida uh with my grandparents and they have done Weight Watchers for the last like 5 years and I asked them why do they do it by the way explain Weight Watchers because Americans know what Weight Watchers is but actually the vast majority of non-americans don't know what it is and explain why it's genius totally and and by the way you you may be able to fill in the gaps here because I just know it's secondhand for my grandparents I've never done Weight Watchers myself so my understanding is Weight Watchers is a dieting program that involves a combination of like uh an actual like program and system and the way the Sy the the Weight Watcher system is basically that if you want to lose weight you have a certain amount of points of food a day and basically every food has a different point value associated with it so I can't remember what my grandparents are but let's just say it's like they could have 30 points a day you know when you're thinking about having food you look up on the weight watch site how many points that food is associated with and you know that you will lose weight if you hit your 30 point total uh intake per day and so there's this system that you have to follow that um if you're part of Weight Watchers on top of that there are weekly meetings so my grandma and grandpa attend a weekly meeting every Saturday morning where they go they weigh in so they they see how they are tracking on their weight relative to the last meeting but it's everyone else in their area that's part of Weight Watchers and it almost feels like the way they described it is like AA where the group is congregated and talking about what is working for them what is not and any new recipes or Foods they have that they recommend to the group because there's like a low point value but like it's a really hearty or tasty meal did I did I hit generally what it is or is there anything I'm missing there's all so yes you're you're you you nailed it except for one little thing that has sent the stock up like 100% this year or last year this the investment in like the company the the weight loss drugs yes so know yeah basically OIC and the like have obviously taken the World by storm Weight Watchers is a community- based program that works like the system works like people go to these meetings they follow the system and there's some amazing results some people don't want to put in the work your grandparents want to put in the work some people don't and especially the younger generation so they actually uh invested in I think it's a gp1 drug and uh so it's kind of like hey do you want to lose weight this way do you want to lose that weight weight that way so they're giving more options to folks to lose weight yep and specifically the company was sequence yes that they bought I think it was in March of last year and basically my understanding is it's a tella health obesity treatment platform and so it's basically if you're exploring weight loss via one of these drugs whether it's OIC or wovi it's a platform where you talk to an expert and then you end up getting uh basically recommended or prescribed one of these drugs exactly yeah and and just to go to the idea for a second basically there's just like a few interesting trends that I think line up to to have an interesting business for 20 to 30 something who are looking to lose weight the first is like I think weight loss has been important for a long time to people um in kind of the Modern Age where like Health has been emphasized but I feel like we we are in kind of like a hyperdrive period around body and health optimization and I think like you're seeing interesting things pop up like what you know Brian Johnson AK Zer is doing with uh I think blueprint is the name of it right where like Brian Johnson is literally created this blueprint for trying to extend his age and never die and I think that is going to resonate with people I think it's especially going to resonate with like startup like kind of like super early adopter uh folks who are like kind of in a good way extremists about going all out on a certain goal of longevity and health but I think for the average person like the average Millennial like that's going to feel too intense it's going to feel too intense to think about the idea of doing a blood transfusion in order to save a few years of your life and so and at the same time right like this post covid age I think has just created this constant reminder of the importance of community community and the importance of like iners Gathering it's like why I'm sitting in morning Brew's office right now is like I realized how much much I miss that and so I think you know it's a definitely a good thing for Greg Eisenberg like there's never been more emphasis or value placed on community and so I think this idea of like Community accountability and like emphasis on a health program that helps you lose weight and I think especially at a time where like OIC and wovi are be being talked about but I think for every like story about it there's going to be like a negative story about how this is like not a sustainable way to be healthy and it's not it's not for everyone I think this kind of model of diet program with accountability group I haven't seen it exist for our age like there's some like new modalities like I think n has been very successful but like I tried n it wasn't successful for me I I think pure accountability or group accountability with di program can be really interesting so I agree with you I agree with you but I want to say a few things so one is what's interesting is if you look at the Google Trends data like the search search interest data over the last 11 years for weight loss it's actually gone down so interesting so interesting and why do you think that is and spoil spoiler alert it's not cuz everyone's fit now you know it's not like people are magically way more fit in 2024 than they were in 2013 I think that when I think about okay so I think this idea could work if you Rebrand weight loss to this generation um I think the reason why people are not searching weight loss anymore is because weight loss to me feels like a term that was very popular in the 80s and 90s it's like when Diet Coke was everywhere and like the diet phenomenon you know aspartame got really popular so I think people a lot of people tried to diet and realize dieting is just difficult you know it's a lot of work you have to put in your work and let's be real people don't want to put in the work that's why they're taking a drug literally a drug to to lose weight to shortcut and if I was trying to create something in this space what I would do is I would brand it as like the drugs are bad for you.com yeah yeah yeah you counterposition it against drugs yeah exactly and I would make it a challenge like join the challenge a free challenge that people can join kind of like um I really like uh small bets. Co have you seen that no it's like if you go to their website interested in entrepreneurship forget about starting a company try making $1,000 with a small project first so it's basically a bunch it's like events plus Community around people who are this is cool yeah trying to try new things and just the idea like the brand around small bets is really interesting I would do a challenge basically my point is I would do a challenge email based maybe text based even yeah yeah it's it's almost kind of like it's like a modern version of or like there's aspects of it that remind me of like orange theory like I don't know you know the orange theory model but like basically called hundreds of Orange Theory locations around the US every day Orange Theory has the same workout in every single studio so every Studio on that day has everyone doing the same workout and they're basically leaderboards of and and when you go to Orange Theory they have like their proprietary scores which are like kind of like how long you're in the orange Zone how many like Splat points you earned and every day there's a leaderboard for the people who earn the most Splat points points or we're in the orange Zone the longest and so I can imagine a world in in which like kind of there's the same challenges that exist across all groups within this program and there's both short-term goals and long-term goals or challenges that people are competing against and there's fun and interesting prizes around it yeah and I think what's so brilliant about that Splat points I never heard heard about that is like you can only get your Splat points in one place you know exactly it's a it's a when you own these terms it's a mo that is very very defensible yeah and by the way one thing I'll also to say here is beyond just like the let's call it like the modern day Weight Watchers I think there's like a broader thing that's interesting which is seeing more and more businesses this is more of a trend that are like capitalizing on the idea of peer groups I don't know exactly where like the most interesting opportunity is yet but like I think you have everything from like peer groups on the fringes to like peer groups that are more mainstream so like what I consider to be like Fringe peer groups is like men's groups like men's groups feel very much still like they're this thing that exists for like you know super liberal people living in Brooklyn or like uh startup Founders for a group of 8 to 10 men to talk about to have vulnerable conversations with each other but I it still doesn't feel like it has gotten to mass Market um with then you have like peer groups in the form of um AA which has been around for ever and I think honestly AA is just a model for anyone who is interested in community building and group dynamics like should just read the big book and study a aa's history but I think there's an interesting model of what does AA look like for Tech addiction I would join that because I'm so addicted to my technology but then you have like more mainstream applications that are popping up like I don't know if you saw the founders of Soul cycle just launched a peer Group business where like they were basically like what would Soul cycle look like if we launched the Business Without The Bicycle that was like their whole thing we launch the business without the B bicycle and it's like basically it's a a space it's a they do virtual and iners in person they launched a studio in New York City where a group of strangers come in and they have deep meaningful conversations that almost acts as like their spiritual Rejuvenation or workout on a weekly basis I don't know what the right entry point is here but to me there's a reason that all this is happening do you remember the name of the Soul cycle experience peoplehood peoplehood so I was a part of I think the first or second or one of the first peoplehood inperson meetups in 2019 are you serious yeah um so I was invited and it's really interesting because they basically I forget the name of the author but they they they worked with some well-known author in the space who has a system for uh having good relation reltionship with people Y and so they basically in in a way they license this system and they're product they productized it via peerto peer group and Via an app and it's brilliant and it's a similar it's the similar concept to like the weight you know the Weight Watchers point system or the orange the like it's always start with the system build you know actually what is it let's break it down it's category of one how do you build a category of one it's how do you build a system that is super scalable yep and what else am I missing uh well and to me it's like I mean this is the obvious one but like how do you hit on like a um an acute need that it's that's most needed right now yeah um and and that's where I'll say like I both understand it but I also think it's a hard business so like what people is doing to me is capitalizing on this you know kind of like all of this narrative around loneliness right like you see all these studies around loneliness in society and I do believe it but I also think it's way harder to build a great business off of that because it's always less tangible it feels more ephemeral you want to join a dieting program you very clearly know if you're losing 10 pounds and other people very clearly know if you're losing 10 pounds whether you feel less lonely or not it feels like a squishier problem to solve for someone yeah unless unless it's improving you know I think they call it relation Rel ship Fitness or so it's improving a relationship so unless you're going with you know your your partner totally and that's like to me that's um that's why I always wonder like even as I was talking about like the AA for Tech addiction and by the way the reason I have that idea is because I think for me to be less addicted to my technology I need accountability built in because when I've tried different apps I just don't follow the rules and I stay addicted but I will say the reason I think even that business is harder to build is because while I really want to change that behavior it doesn't feel like the same level of desperation to someone who is in you know the throws of addiction and it's ruining every aspect of their life yeah I agree I mean maybe there's an opportunity to go to AA and just be like hey like you know cell phone addiction is the new so they La so they launched their their own group that's uh ITA it's internet and Technology uh addicts anonymous and I attended a and how was it it was fascinating um Were You live streaming it I didn't live stream it no but it was on Zoom it was virtual um are you serious yeah I know pretty antithetical right um I will say that that makes you realize how that makes no sense right that's like having a Weight Watchers meeting at like at a McDonald's yeah it's so true um yeah take it up with AA um but yeah I think it was uh really interesting for a few reasons I think one of the values of AA and just these groups in general is it makes you feel uh less isolated like I always thought I was really addicted to my phone but then when you hear some of these people share their stories about how they say for the last decade once a week they pull an all nighter because they are on their phone literally through 24 hours straight and it's gotten to the point of suicidal ideation you're like holy like there there's another level of this I think the other interesting thing is I had a certain image in my head of who is the person that's addicted to their technology and while let's say there are 20 people in this meeting while say five of the people in the meeting lined up with my vision 15 of them did not at all like I can't tell you how many middle-aged moms who are addicted to playing Candy Crush on their home uh on their phone when they're at home for hours a day were in this meeting as well and so I think it that for me actually there wasn't so much like programming or educ in it there was this feeling of uh you're not alone and it sounds so obvious but when you experience that feeling it it really is kind of infectious to want to keep experiencing it I it like I I I just love it amazing yeah yeah all right let's uh let's move to a new idea uh okay G2 personality driven G2 what do you mean by that okay so you know G2 is like the software review site yeah which is really big it's huge it's huge um it's huge yet in some way I've never gone to G2 to make software choices yeah and why do you think that's the cas no and I and I buy tons of software yeah I'm Conant buying I bought software today and like isn't that crazy isn't that crazy though yeah so I I mean I think the reason is one is like the the business model is inherently broken like because it thrives off of like sponsored post and sponsored list listings there's just this inherent question about the authenticity of the recommendations and I think this is like a question that kind of like any uh sponsored content driven site goes through I also think G2 is for a certain demographic that really isn't like in my mind focused on cult like the like new age businesses or Venture back Founders or internet companies like it feels like it's more focused on older School larger corporations I could be wrong but I'm just going off with the fact of none of my friends have ever used G2 and so I think there is an interesting way to help Founders and Executives make smarter decisions around their software in a more scalable way than Greg texting one of his friends to ask them what hey what do you use for video editing because that friend could be the right person to give you the recommendation but they also may not be the right person to give you the recommendation so pin that idea for a second have you heard of a a business called kit. Co no I have not oh yes so go to I've been here but I haven't used it yeah okay so kit. Co is a place where content creators can share their gear stack so for example right now I'm on Marquez brownley you know one of the big YouTubers MKBHD his setup so I'm on his page right now it's kit. cmk MKBHD myy uh setup and it shows me exactly what his setup is so I see he has a Yamaha studio monitor or Herman Miller EMB body chair very fancy Marquez uh next desk airpro seiser headphones Etc basically my view is combine kit. Co and G2 what if there was a place where Entre entrepreneurs and Executives cre can create their software stack where they list out all of the tools they use to run their business or their part of their business they can review the tool they can provide some notes so there's Nuance so people can understand like is this right for me in the context of my business and you can actually do Revenue shares with the people that create their Stacks so all of a sudden you as a platform you can set up affiliate deals with say the 250 most commonly um referenced software uh companies on the platform by your creators and you get Affiliates when anyone signs up through your platform and that affiliate is shared with all of the creators who have list did their stack so there's an incentive for them to have a stack and continue updating their stack I'm just looking at this like this seems like a no-brainer idea yeah you know um and by the way one reason I say this is there's an entrepreneur I know and I don't know if he wants people to know this so I'm not going to say who it is who built a popular directed consumer company sold this company and he has found a way he he has manually built his stack so he created a Google doc that has all the software and the agencies that he used to build his company it's a Google doc it's in his linkoln bio when someone follows him on Twitter he they get an auto DM from him saying hello as well as if they're interested in the tools he's used to build his company they get access to the Google Doc he's currently doing $40,000 a month in affiliate fees from this Doc and by the way a huge value of this platform to creators is it is an absolute pain in the ass to set up all these affiliate deals I have I'm setting this up for myself right now and I'm going Company by company by company some of which have affiliate deals some of which I'm having create affiliate deals for the first time it's a nightmare yeah and kit. Co really isn't geared towards us like the sort of the B2B Creator like this feels this feels very like consumer it feels YouTu yeah exactly which is great for them I actually think that they pck the wrong Market but you know this is this is the right Market this is the right Market the market where the average deal size is 250k is the right market right meanwhile Mr Beast is like gloating about getting 250k for like what a 100 million views on YouTube exactly that's a hard that's a hard game I don't want to play totally I'm like wow that was a lot of work my friend yeah um cool let's uh let's do a couple more um Pinterest for knowledge my wife works at Pinterest so you know don't don't displace her yet no no I I like I like Pinterest so basically I mean this is like an idea that I have been so passionate about since launching the brew and I haven't seen a great solution for this is I believe um I believe that curation is like a superpower in today's internet and the reason I believe that is because it's never been easier to create content more content is being created than ever before and my belief on all this where this kind of ends up netting out 5 to 10 years from now is you just have this messy middle of a ton of regurgitated mediocre content that's put out onto the internet and you just still have this small band of the top 0.1% to 1% ideas that doesn't really get that much larger because there aren't that many of those people that have truly novel or like um best-in-class ideas and so my view is like for most people creating content is actually not the best service that they can provide to society it is curating the best ideas from the top 1% creators and I've had this idea because like there are certain creators who I really respect and follow like for example I read everything that Ben Thompson writes I read everything that Matt LaVine writes um I listen to Andrew huberman's podcasts um I listen to Patrick oas's podcasts as interesting to me as what I'm listening to is the thought I have in my head of like what is going into their body what is informing their views what are the interesting things they're reading and consuming such that they're outputting these ideas and so and and uh like I don't know if you saw like there's a lot of people who already curate what they're consuming just in this manual way like chth chth comes out with a newsletter every week that's what I read this week and it's like a link dump of seven URLs to me I would love a platform where I can follow the I can basically go down the rabbit hole of individual's brains so I can follow the people whose brains I admire most and I can see exactly what is the that they're putting into their brains and not only can I follow them but I see an interesting where way where like ultimately you can create Stacks you can create stacks of the stuff you consume around Fitness the stuff you consume around uh like the world of Frontier Tech or Hardware whatever it may be and I see a world in which you can actually have premium subscription to people's curated content where you not only get the curation you get the notes and the annotations people's analysis of the stuff that they're reading within their curated stacks and so like I again this is like a bigger swing that's like an idea I haven't seen but I would love a world where basically curation as a service becomes a thing this is one of those ideas which is like I don't want to do at all but someone do it so we you know I I was at I worked at a company called stumble upon which was like an OG content Discovery app you'd press a button the stumble button and it would bring on a web page and you were able to like it and dislike it one of the most interesting features was stumbling other people's likes exactly so you know gck Camp who's the co-founder of uber he's also the co-founder of stumble Pon you can go and he's got amazing taste and you you'd be able to go on to his likes and just see what's what is he putting into his brain I think uh I agree that that that that stumble likes needs to be reincarnated in some new exactly it's like what if I could see Greg eisenberg's bookmarks on Twitter yeah and and I think you just brought up a word that to me is like becoming more and more it's being more and more emphasized than ever before which is taste in a world of hyper commoditization where software is commoditized where uh content's being commoditized where like many things are becoming um where we are being displaced by technology I think taste like having being an incredible taste maker is actually one of the greatest advantages you can have like to me when I think about people who have individuals who have unfair advantage in different Industries whether it's music agents who find talent super early whether it's uh media entrepreneurs who find writers early in their career um whether it's podcasters who decide the topics or the guests that are worth surfacing I actually think taste is like it it's only the early days of taste being one of the more important things or skills that the best let's call it professionals or entrepreneurs will have so I got a text today from a creator that you know millions of followers and she says random question she doesn't text me a lot so I saw she texted me I'm like whoa let me open this up random question hiring those who have quote unquote taste how do you define taste visual editorial for instance my head of HR does not have taste AKA his dress style his word choice but how do I screen that and Define taste so I responded I don't know if this is right but this is what I said I just wrote in quotation marks who do you follow on Instagram what are your favorite Brands what was the last concert you went to what is your favorite drink can you make a mood board on Pinterest on XYZ topic dot dot dot yeah basically what you're saying is you use specific examples to basically say have the person show you their taste and then it's in a in a meta way you have to in a meta way it's almost like a kind of like a like an overconfidence thing of to to assess this you have to assume you have good taste and you're assessing someone else's taste based on your taste of their taste exactly I mean we used to have technology assessments it's like hey can you like write this program now we're going to have taste taste assessments yeah I think um yeah I think uh what's like the famous definition of product Market fit it's like how do you know when you see product Market fit it's you don't like it's like hardcore porn you just know it when you see it it's like um you just know the people on the internet that have great taste and you know the people that don't like uh H one like Shawn Pur I would say sha Pur has great taste like he has great taste in what entrepreneurs are going to naturally feel a a magnetic pull towards could I write a a presentation defining the taste of Shawn Pur I think it'd be really difficult because there's 15 years of context of PR uh career context that has led him to using his gut a lot and his gut is this incredible uh amalgamation of data data points over many years so like he has taste but it would be very hard for me to Define what his taste is totally and I and I want to say you can be older and have taste but you can also be young and have Great Taste yeah and actually I'd argue one of the most impressive things to me is when you're a generation different than like you have great let's just use it an example of like Matt LaVine Matt LaVine I think has great taste on what he talks about for like Millennials or young professionals but I think he wouldn't I don't think he's considered a millennial I think he's considered like a generation older and I I would say that's actually sometimes what's most impressive to me me is when people are able to basically straddle generations with quality taste because I'm even seeing for myself when I look at like my younger cousin who's still in high school and what is deemed as good taste for her friend group and people of her age it's super difficult because you basically have to immerse yourself in living in the way that her friend group lives while also living in your age group so if we think that the the world is going to appreciate taste more I mean if we're hiring for Taste I'm sure and I'm sure there's others how do you monetize taste like besides getting a job with and besides creating a a Pinterest for knowledge yeah what's a what's an easier way to monetize your taste without raising a bunch of venture capital and and going crazy uh I mean you know what one way is uh is what's the name of the one second I want to find the name of this one isn't there a website called like really good sites or really good designs yes really good emails I yeah really good emails like I'm like what does really good emails look like in a different vertical for people who need inspiration to do their job basically I don't know how really good emails monetizes but basically it's like I'm on their website right now and it's very clearly for email marketers and really good emails has basically used their taste and their judgment and people come to really good emails because they trust their judgment to look at a collection of different email newsletter designs that they deem to be high quality I think it's interesting to think about like and I know there's another uh website that does this for ad creative I can't remember what they're called but there's like an inspiration site for if you're a paid marketer and you want to look at great creative to run on Facebook or Instagram whatever I'd think about what is another vertical where a B2B professional needs great inspiration to do their job effectively yeah and they do really good emails on looking right now they've got like 100 169,000 uh subscribers to their email they charge $9 a month and you get unlimited collections you can sort you can filter there's a Chrome extension I'm sure they I'm sure they do quite well uh and if you're yeah by the way another example of this is like what does really good emails look like for written content like what does it actually look like to create an inspiration Board of the best Twitter LinkedIn like written text content for people who are copywriters or uh text like just writers on the internet yeah yeah I think uh with your taste right with some context um exactly marketing examples you know that one yep similar idea where they have a bunch of different categories acquisition conversion retention brand and so I'm looking like right now like go ahead by the way the other way to do it is through content like if you want to do this as a Creator do what if you're willing to dedicate your entire life to it do what David cenro did with Founders right this guy has picked a vertical and he's curating the best biographies and audio autobiographies in the world about the greatest Founders yeah and he has the taste to pick the best books and then it's this combination of curation and then remixing he's remixing it by basically redelivering you what's most important and why you should care so think about like what's a vertical where it takes a lot of work to do the curation but that curation and that analysis is really important to the people that this is for I like that Founders for X is is a big idea yeah um amazing dude this is this has been awesome I actually have to run to I a haircut I actually just got a haircut before I joined here but I walked into my apartment and my wife was like what happened to your hair and I was like what do you mean it looks great I looked at I looked in the mirror she's like so mean she's like the back the back is like they up the back I mean I'll show it for for the people I I mean I can't believe I'm doing this but hold on let me see can you see that it's like curv yeah it's not a straight it's not a straight line no so yeah your wife did you your wife did you a solid it it's it's like calling someone out when they have something stuck in their tooth it's the equivalent of that so I'm gonna go for a a little even out yeah and um where could uh where could folks find you in the projects you're working on um can find me on Twitter at business Barista my podcast is Founders Journal where I'm curating the best uh startup content on the internet and then synthesizing it so you don't have to do the searching or the reading um and then my new business story ARB which helps uh Executives build their brands on social I love it check them out come back anytime Alex this is this is obviously so fun later this was fun

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
I've started and sold three venture-backed companies before the age of 30 and here are 50 realizations that changed my life as an entrepreneur first is startup valuation is literally a madeup number what I mean by that is that you know Venture capitalists or people who want to buy your company in their early stages based on fear of losing the deal will literally make up a number that is you know valuation is more art than science and that was a big shock to me the second it's impossible to work with people who don't answer texts within 24 hours now this is a bit spicy I think that especially at the early stages you want to have people that are going to respond to you um and of course people have weekends and you know I totally get that and you want to respect people's weekends and time off but if you're texting someone obviously something is really really important maybe you know your app is down or your software is down or so I think having having your core crew uh being able to respond to text quickly uh is helpful the third the internet can be your lottery ticket or your prison sentence now uh for me the internet has been a lottery ticket you know especially social you know I've had tweets that have gotten 70,000 likes I've had Jeff Bezos follow me on Twitter it's gotten me into some crazy room but it can also be a prison sentence if you're scrolling Instagram and it's making you feel bad so how do you Orient it to to be more of a lottery ticket than a prison sentence that's a prompt for you number four if abomi and fit can Rebrand and their their stock is up 285 in 2023 then you can Rebrand too self-explanatory you could Rebrand at any time reinvent yourself at any time number five having an internet audio a is still wildly underpriced number six build products that no one ask for but everyone wants that's something that I've learned when you build a product that no one asks for but everyone wants it's it's they see the product and they're going to share that product with everyone number seven it's actually a good idea to be poor in your 20s and reinvest everything in yourself learnings Travel network figuring out who you are I think the your 20s is all about learning and it's about building assets and those assets could be not necessarily bank account assets they can be who you know you know your network it could be experiences it could be skills so I think you should look at your 20s as multiple Banks not just a financial bank number eight Google is probably not going to copy your startup build your startup and ignore the incumbents that are going to copy your startup number nine content is your sales person that works for you 24/7 number 10 look for opportunities that are low stat status now but probably high status in a few years so for example building a bootstrap startup a couple years ago was pretty low status you know cash flow was low status it was all about how do I raise hundreds of millions of dollars build a unicorn billion doll company um but now I would I would say that the tides are turning now having cash flowing internet businesses are becoming a bit more High status number 11 lifestyle businesses are still Mass ly underrated you can often turn them into non-li lifestyle businesses if you want so that's the thing you know what is a lifestyle business lifestyle business is generally a non-venture back business sometimes it's a service business maybe it's an agency and it's there to support your lifestyle but what people don't realize is that these lifestyle businesses could turn into larger outcome businesses businesses that you can eventually sell for large sums of money if you want so you have that option never forget it I'm give you an example you can start a service business learn about uh the problems that a particular group has your customers have and then maybe you build software or a physical product uh that you sell to them number 12 avoid dependency on anything social apps VCS Etc freedom is two words self- sustaining number 13 taking a break doesn't mean you're lazy burnout is real I've been burnt out uh a few times and it's tough to come back from it takes a long time so uh what I've learned is that now I take regular breaks um it could be taking a weekend off or just taking an afternoon off going into nature or something like that but you do need to recharge if you're going to last in the entrepreneurship world number 14 whatever you do don't me don't be mid curve basically don't be mediocre you know be exceptional at what you do number 15 the only things that should change your mood are things things that will change your life it is so easy for us to have our moods changed you know a client cancels out cancels on you uh you apply for a job and you don't get it but you really wanted it there's only a few things that will actually change your life and those are generally health related sometimes you know wealth related but very rarely so don't let things that are small like don't sweat this small stuff is basically what I'm saying number 16 copycats are a nuisance not killers they are usually mosquitoes not sharks if you're going to be building anything content a business and you are going to gain popularity people will see that and they will try to copy you it is the nature of human beings it's also nature of the internet but don't worry about it it's the cost of doing business um they are usually mosquitoes number 17 good design can't fix a poor product but good design can multiply a product that's working so you want to have your us user experience nailed and amazing before you layer on beautiful design number 18 people follow a journey not an account there's so many social accounts that people could be following and that's not really what people want they want to follow a journey they want to be along for the ride so how do you create content with that in mind number 19 if you're doing stuff you hate you aren't Rich if you're spending your days in a lot of meetings and you don't like meeting things then even if your bank account is showing you know a lot of money how rich are you how wealthy are you number 20 don't create a startup without a why now a why now basically means like why should this business exist right now what has changed in the world such that it's opened up an opportunity for this business so I'll give you an example you know Uber you download the Uber app you press a button and a car comes to you a lot of things in terms of why now had to align for that to make sense for example the mobile app store that didn't exist 4 years before Uber came out GPS on mobile phones people putting their credit cards on mobile phones so as the world changes take note because that'll help you with your why now and why this should exist number 21 strangers don't want to hear about you they want to talk about themselves or better themselves this was a realization just about people in general people want to talk about themselves so let them talk about themselves number 22 the best negotiators talk 10% of the time and listen 90% if you want to negotiate you sit at a table and what a lot of people do or what I used to do when I first started negotiating is I would just talk a lot here's all the reasons why I think I'm worth this amount and that's kind of a rookie move the move is to say your point say what you want really quickly and really Su succinctly and let the other side talk a lot as as they're talking you're taking notes and you're clarifying in your head what you're going to come back with and let them just sort of run on the more data that you're informed with the better you can be as a negotiator so you're just like equipping yourself with data number 23 good things happen when you add value to people's lives through content and Community you know I give a lot of content away for free free communities and and stuff like that and my strategy is basically earn trust and if you earn people's trust good things will happen it's worked for me it's going to work for you number 24 you can learn a lot about someone by their likes on Twitter or X sometimes when I want to learn about some someone I'll go to their Twitter account I'll look at if they're active and I'll look at their likes and you can kind of get a sense as to what people are thinking in that moment it's pretty interesting and underutilized by most people number 25 first find the niche then learn from the community then the startup idea will come to you A lot of people when they want to build a business they try to just come up with startup ideas the way to come up with startup ideas that actually work is you find a niche an underserved Niche and you build some Community you know e you maybe it's a private Community maybe it's a public Community but you build a community of people that have these problems needs wants desires and you just listen and take notes and over time you'll develop ideas to serve those people that's that's business in a nutshell number 26 on hiring if it isn't a hell yeah it's a hell no never compromise for fit this one is an important one because in earlier in my career I would hire people who might look like on paper that they're a perfect fit but there's just something off and in earlier my career i' would still hire them because on paper they're perfect um I'd rather hire someone who has less of the perfect fit went to the right schools worked at the right companies but is willing to learn and just has that grit to them and that's going to fit with uh the people and the culture of our company and our holding company so don't compromise on that number 27 startups never go according to plan there is no real plan for startups only a direction if you follow that you'll be a lot more calm when things happen because it's just par for the course when problems arise and they will arise number 28 the best businesses are the ones that look like a movement it needs to be an identity not a product so what do I mean by that an identity is something that people can really connect with for example I am a cold plunge person I do a keto diet I drive a Volvo now if you're you know one of these people maybe you're a Volvo person or keto person like it becomes a part of your identity so the best businesses look like these movements these life stages these this is me this is who I am so if you start with the movement and then you map out the customer Journey then the customer Journey becomes these products that you essentially could sell along the way so that people can become more intertwined with the movement those are the best businesses number 29 your identity is never your company ever your company is your business number 30 change scenery two to three times per day to extra creative I'm guilty of this a lot of time I'll just sit down in the mornings and basically not leave my desk except for grabbing a little bit of food and coffee it's good to switch up the scenery go for a walk if you work from home maybe you work from home in the morning and then you go work from a coffee shop in the afternoon changing the scenery is super super important and just makes you become a bit more of a productive person 31 people always want to see behind the scenes so if you create content the behind the scenes content is sometimes the most interesting you know if you watch a movie and then at the end you know you're watching the bloopers it's definitely something that is very memorable so people remember the behind the scenes content it's often worth the investment 32 number 32 the happiest people live pretty simple lives not chasing more and more in our culture it's always more money more followers more this more that but I've noticed some of the happiest people that I know aren't always on the chase aren't always on the honic treadmill in fact they're playing a completely different game number 33 if there's an active Community there's a business there there's probably a business worth creating number 34 digital businesses beats any laundromat self storage or vending machine business it's basically easier and better margins to build internet-based businesses so I know it's actually been a bit of a trend to focus on boring businesses like laundromats and stuff like that uh it's beyond me I don't really understand why but but uh I think that if you have a great digital business a wonderful internet business they're asset light doesn't take a lot to build especially now with things like Ai No code you can automate it really well you don't have to pay rent so there's a lot of Pros with building on the internet consider it number 35 only create 50% plus margin businesses like SAS paid communities Etc so when you're thinking about building your business uh and you're prioritizing how you're going to monetize think about high margin sounds obvious but you'd be surprised how few people do it and I've been guilty of this uh in the past too 36 cash flow over valuation any day of the week what I mean by that is who cares if a venture fund is going to say your business is worth a billion dollars it feels nice but building cash flowing businesses is ultimately a huge reward from a financial standpoint so prioritize cash flow don't prioritize valuation if you have to prioritize one 37 higher global Talent the world is bigger than New York City or Silicon Valley there's tons of incredible people all over the world so if you're building an internet business there's no reason why you'd limit yourself to a particular geography number 38 you create your own narrative narratives drives Word of Mouth which drives Revenue which is your oxygen number 39 if something is sold out customers want it 10 times more this is literally just human nature number 40 diversify cash flow every year multiple bets multiple products you know maybe you're a solo preneur maybe you built one cash flowing asset diversify you never know what's going to happen and the beauty is like I mentioned easier than ever to create products now so it's worth diversifying your Revenue with multiple products we're often creating one product per month just as an experiment think about what your Cadence might look like for building new products so you can diversify number 41 selling your first company is an emotional journey I remember selling my first company and boy it was ups and downs and it's always ups and downs when you're selling your company but you know first company definitely the most if you're preparing to sell your company or you think you're going to sell your company within the next year or two just note that it will take an emotional toll you will have ups and downs so buckle up number 42 designing rituals into your community is what brings people back remind them to see you tomorrow so many internet communities are zombie communities I think the you know 90 plus% of them are are basically dead the ones that work really well are the ones that have rituals like programming events a person who's reminding them to come back don't forget about rituals number 43 being around people who have a clear understanding of what they want from life is refreshing number 44 competitors can copy your products but they cannot copy your community so always be privatizing building your community building that identity fostering that build that brand connection it is worth it number 45 five make friends with people in your industry earn their trust and don't ask for anything for a long time overwhelm them with value it'll pay back number 46 listen to podcast take notes basically like you're sitting in the room with the world's greatest Founders and entrepreneurs now I'm not saying I'm the world's greatest entrepreneur I'm not but I have had you a unique set of experiences and I'm just telling you I've distilled everything I've learned in these like 50 little tidbits so that you can remember it and I'm just like riffing with you in real time and if you hear something that resonates with you write it down put it post it on a sticky note post it on your desk so you don't forget tweet about it write a blog post about it so it's drilled into your into your psyche so many people of us take in all this content and they're like oh that's such a good idea or I really dis even if you disagree with something I really disagree with that they don't write it down so they forget don't be that person 47 pick a niche and make a meme page if you understand understand the memes you understand the people don't build until you understand the memes you know what are memes memes are something that people will share it's something that they can they look at they get it often it's Visual and they'll share it I do this a lot you know go on Reddit or I'll go on Twitter or Instagram and when I'm looking at a movement that I'm trying to create I'll see like what are the memes that people are sharing and I'll sort of Bank it I'll have like a meme Bank see see what they're saying and from that try to create my own memes 48 the only audience you have is the audience you own email text Community if the algorithm changes uh or someone you know Elon Musk buys Twitter changes it to X and all of a sudden he's promoting images and videos and you only like to write text you learn firsthand that you don't own the audience so you know the best day to start an email newsletter the best day to you know collect text the best way is our community is soon is once you have a significant amount of internet audience you know usually it's in the few thousands and then you could start siphoning some of those to get their data and to get them know them more but yeah remember the only audience you have is the audience you own 49 there's a fine line between generalist and procrastinator number 50 the last but not least people expect opportunities to come to them they rarely do assume your loan and go after it and I think that's a perfect way to end opportunities won't come for you you have to go out there you have to send the DM you have to post on social you have to create the community you have to create the product you have to learn the skill you have to go to the events go get it and you'll be surprised what this internet could offer you it's pretty amazing and I hope you enjoyed some of my 50 realizations that I've learned as an entrepreneur and let me know if you do uh write in the comments in the YouTube comments which one was your favorite which one you hated if you have any to add that of your own realizations I'd love to hear it I read every single comment see you later bye

rather than starting with question of how can I make this thing better most of my work starts with why does this suck so bad and like how could I make it suck more I wasn't necessarily creating a product I was creating the medic content exacerbating the pain that people feel you'll often understand parts of the experience or patterns that lead to that pain and then you can reverse engineer and kind of do the opposite and make it better almost anything is it takes a lot of exper experimentation and a lot of throwing stuff against the wall to figure out what's going to react get a get a response if you're working on something and you don't want to put your name on it from the beginning you should probably reconsider whether or not you actually want to be working on it cuz you should be proud to put your name on stuff you work on saurin Iverson I've been looking forward to this call for a while you are the the idea machine of the internet admit it just admit it yeah the idea guy oh there he is there he is um excited to chat uh for people who don't know him he goes on Twitter he takes apps that people use and then he like kind of remixes it with new ideas and they get thousands of likes and laughs yeah we're uh we're optimizing for Chuckles as much as we are engagement I don't know I think some of the funniest ones are the ones that get the least like online traction but you know you can't always have bangers yeah you can't always have bangers we hope for bangers but today we are on the ideas podcast and of course you brought some Banger ideas and I just want to spend some time to jam with you on them yeah sounds good so let's start with what you're seeing in terms of Hardware because I don't have a lot of people come on this show and Pitch Hardware especially in 2024 yeah um when capital is is hard to come by and Hardware traditionally is an expensive thing to do so what's exciting you in hardware and why do you think there's startup ideas in the space so I think there are kind of orders of magnitude when you consider Hardware like I don't know if you would consider like books I.E what I've been doing I by bootstrapping an audience and then selling a a product which is really an entertainment product as Hardware but most people that get big on a social network they'll make like a knowledge product or an info product and then it's like 100% margin right I think I started making stuff for fun and then people started asking for a product and so they started asking for a book specifically so I made that and it I mean the more you order the cheaper it's going to be and I think people get really intimidated by the idea of like making a physical object but the internet is pretty amazing and Alibaba I messaged a bunch of different manufacturers I found a manufacturer that was able to meet my specification requirements which was like deboss foil printing hard cover like high quality like gloss pages and went through a couple rounds of sample testing with them and then got a product that I liked meanwhile I took pre-orders with a payment link and have a new product right so I was able to subsidize the initial order cost with the pre-orders that I got and then from there I was able to scale it up so I think even individual people that have an audience and want to do something like that you can bootstrap that way I think then you look at AI companies that are gr all in on Hardware I think Humane rewind tab rabbit like I don't have I mean I haven't really used any of these products in person I I I pre-ordered tab so I'm waiting on getting one of those I've talked with AI a couple times I think the thing that I respect and find exciting about all the players in the space is that that there's a general sentiment that the form factor that we interact with on a daily basis I.E phones is great but maybe it isn't the thing that will kind of be the container for the next step in software and so people are really experimenting like a pendant on a necklace something that like pins your clothing uh little almost like game boy looking thing I think and I mean rabbit I don't remember what the exact exact post was but it compared Apple's initial pre-order or initial order numbers with the order numbers that rabbit is seeing and Rabbit's seeing a huge number of orders for their first round and I know they're ramping up production to try to keep up with that so I think there's like Capital intensive ways like that where you're a funded startup with a lot of proprietary software and then you're building Hardware as a complimentary form factor but then there's the initial path that I mentioned which is like an individual Creator that's working on something maybe it's a book maybe it's something like um I can't remember the designer's name they make a lot of like office supplies and like productivity tools and planners and stuff like that like if you can make a render of it or if you can pay someone a small amount of want you to make a render for it there are people either overseas or in the United States that you can almost always find to make the thing in your head real which is really crazy to me and I I kind of wish more people were aware of that and kind of took the steps to make things in their head a reality because even if some of these AI tools or you know other projects people take on end up being if they don't like become massive successes there's still a lot of learnings and insight and even like joy and in the longterm like Nostalgia that comes along with those like I look at like Sega Dreamcast for example that was like the first the first like 3D gaming system that had like an op open world RPG Sonic Adventure which is like a game I grew up on and they ultimately didn't get the market share that Xbox or PS1 has but like you see that logo and you you like feel something deeply and a lot of that was because Sega was willing to take a huge swing on a new platform and a new you know new tech new form factor new hardware um and I think the Ripple of the effects of what that even uh inspires people to make long term um it's hard to understate that so A buddy of mine created something called tiny pod have you heard about it I had a conversation with someone last week about tiny pod yeah okay so we'll give him a little shout out so my buddy newr he he led the design engineering team at snap so obviously super smart guy and he was he's he's been always one of those guys like he was like a jailbreak Guru you know he was like always jailbreaking things like always into you know pushing the limits on devices and he uh he started something called tiny pod and basically what it does is it transforms the Apple watch into what almost looks like the original iPhone so you remember like the clicky you know circular wheel I guess for for the iPod like he basically picture an Apple Watch you remove the strap and he's got and he has this like case essentially that allows you to use it just like that and at the surface you're like Ah that's kind of cool it's a case for the it's a case for the um for the Apple watch but like I don't really get it but what he was saying to me was what people are really excited about is the fact that a lot of people are feeling overwhelmed with their phones and they want to leave their phones at home um some people are getting these like dumb phones or flip phones but for most people that's not realistic the beauty about the uh the Apple watch is you know you've got your music you get texts you get some like core things but you don't have everything so what he is saying like his bed is it's kind of this like perfect you know middle in the ground so I think you're going to start to so I agree with your premise with like I don't think newr would do tiny pod five years ago um I think he would have been like it's too complicated how am I going to get this made uh how am I going to sell this uh you know but now he uses Twitter to get hundreds of likes on his uh on his tweets to generate demand he's probably G to use some fulfillment partner overseas to actually create it he uses he's going to use probably Shopify to power it and all the apps that they have around email marketing and customer service and stuff like that he's probably going to have a team of customer service you know overseas like so I think like spinning up these ideas are are a lot quicker and so I think you're on to something on this Hardware bit um which no not no one's talking about yeah I think I think the interesting thing too is Tiny pod is it's really interesting to me because it's a call back to like the Nostalgia of the old iPod it does attempt to solve the like the dumb phone problem in unique way it's like I'm not going to buy a light phone they're really cool but like I have all this stuff that's within Apple's like Walt Garden right and so rather than trying to build something new you're trying to play ball with and subvert the systems that you have and I think the idea that you can take an existing device that's extremely popular and turn it into a completely different a device there was a another launch a couple weeks ago that was a case for your phone that has like a black berry keyboard on it yeah I don't know if you saw that which is I go ahead the interesting thing about that is in like so many CES articles like CES is supposed to be this like the only the most futuristic stuff is coming out of CES and every CES list of the top things you know from CES would be like this like quiry keyboard yeah I think I think it's just like with the first I mean so people like to especially younger like gen gen Z gen a there's a really strong demand for like hyper personalization of objects that you use a lot so like when widgets came out on iOS you saw a ton of people going absolutely crazy with like custom widget packs widget apps just ways to make your phone look like it's your phone and no one else's I think the idea of tiny pod and I don't remember the name of the keyboard kind of case but the idea that you can add an additional like layer of customization to a device that you use all the time in order to of make it work even better for you is is really interesting and then when you stack like skins on top of that so like I know tiny pod and that keyboard will be like one probably one one form factor and like a few color skews to start but with each experimentation of that there are ways you can make it look and feel like your own like I remember all the phone cases that had like they're modeled after anime characters or like whatever and they have like ears on them or you know like stickers I think just the idea of customizing ubiquitous Hardware to feel like your own there's a really high demand for that and um I think this guy is the limit in terms of like how you want to be creative and the strategy that you want to use to either change the way people interact with the device change the way the device looks um or kind of some kind of combination of the two there's a lot of interesting potential that people are just starting to tap into especially as you said as it gets easier to test ideas um and validate them before sinking in enormous amount of money into them so I just pulled up the keyboard company it's called clicks which by the way perfect name um for for this clicks for iPhone it's $139 which honestly for a case is pretty expensive like I I just bought a case for my iPhone I think it was $40 $40 or $50 so pretty expensive um and but it's not just a keyboard I'm looking right now so you have well first of all it says make your statement you know it's it's a state to your point it's like having a statement by by custom you know by having this um says gain up to 50% more display to immerse yourself in chats browsing live streaming real Keys make typing feel so natural scroll through website so it's really interesting I think you're you're on to something here with these devices have become so ubiquitous we're looking for ways to make it our own Nostalgia is coming back people are willing to pay for it it's cheaper than ever to you know create these things um and the truth is they can partner with creators like someone might be like well I don't have not like sorin I don't have hundreds of thousands of Twitter followers well it's like okay well maybe you can connect with someone like saurin and maybe you can collabor collab with someone like him um and all you need is like a landing page a little bit of money to you know maybe not you in particular I don't know if you do those things but um a little bit money to work with a Creator and you can and you can launch and you have to come and you have to be original like clicks looks like it's it's really interesting looks cool tiny pod like you go to the website tiny pod.com like it gets you excited that's the other thing like if you're going to create something in Hardware it has to get someone excited it can't be just like a little bit better yeah I think also looking at the looking at the clicks because I pulled up the clicks website while you're talking about it I think they're actually like opposite ends of the Spectrum in a way where tiny PW just kind of solving the pain of like I want I want to use less of my phone and clicks is like I want to use more of my phone um and it's interesting right because both of those are genuine needs it's like okay you know what I am realizing that every time I go out to hang out with friends I'm on my phone 50% of the time so I'm going to get one of these tiny pods and that way like if people need to get a hold of me they can but it's pretty easy to get like lost in a device this size but if it's like this big you're not going to want to be like hunched over it right but then if you are like watching a lot of twitch live streams or you know you want to spend a bunch of time on Tik Tok or maybe you write a lot and you actually want a more physical form factor there is a real utility that both of them provide in different ways um and I think that also speaks to like the iPhone is an amazing multi-purpose tool that can do just about anything but it is suboptimal for certain things writing watching video in certain inst watching video while writing comments responding to it things like that and so click specifically identifies like the weak point in the hardware and then makes that a selling point of their extension of it right like apple isn't going to build a keyboard maybe they will now but they weren't going to like build a keyboard for their phone that had a keyboard but I mean the that phone is so popular and so many are sold every year that you can build a business on top of that ecosystem pretty easily and a pretty big business like I wouldn't be surprised if click sells 30,000 units this year like is there 30,000 people that are you know first of all are nostalgic for this and also want to you know be faster want want a want a physical form factor out in the world like probably you know yeah after the Cs coverage right like totally that's the other thing it's like how do you how do you reverse engineer your product ideas such that they do go viral and they do get covered you know a lot of people and you're the master at this but a lot of people create a product and then they're like okay let me like send it to a bunch of journalists and then they don't get any love and they don't get anyone writing articles and stuff like that how do you think about creating a physical product that is going to be shared shared by thousands yeah I think I mean I think mine is a unique case because I wasn't necessarily like creating a product I was creating like mimic content um I think one thing that I've seen a lot of people do when they're working on something is they'll throw the idea out there and if they don't get immediate validation they kind of just mark it as a loss and move on and the reality of almost anything is it takes a lot of exper experimentation and a lot of throwing stuff against the wall to figure out what's going to react get a get a response right um and I think there's there's ways you can do that without doing it in a public forum or you can do that by of creating a brand or a separate entity if you don't want to attribute your name to it I will say if you're working on something and you don't want to put your name on it from the beginning you should probably reconsider whether or not you actually want to be working on it because you should be proud to put your name on stuff you work on um so I think like pure like cycles and getting feedback and refining is something I think a lot of people don't spend enough time doing and then I think also rather than starting with the question of like how can I make this thing better most of my work starts with like why does this suck so bad and like how could I make it suck more um and it sounds like a pointless exercise but I actually think by exacerbating the pain that people feel you'll often understand parts of the experience or like patterns that lead to that pain and then you can reverse engineer and kind of do the opposite and make it better right um it's actually pretty fun and I've seen product teams I had a design manager reach out to me a couple months ago he said his product team had taken a couple hours and they all worked on like how can we take our product and make it like terrible like way way worse and through that they were able to to find like you know what this part is actually this part of our experience is pretty suboptimal um so I think iteration Cycles not giving up too early um going in the opposite direction to figure out and clarify the direction you want to go into um and then I think also more relevant for most people which are people that don't have a couple hundred thousand followers across social platforms is find people that are willing to go to bat with you sl4 you um um the great thing about how ubiquitous like Tik Tok and micro influencers has become is like even like five years ago to do a social campaign you'd need to probably work with like huge names it cost a lot of money but now some people will just like do it for a free product sample and then other people will do it for like a couple hundred bucks um but you can work with people that have Niche audiences right and that'll actually give you the ability to more analy ically test in different audience subtypes right so rather than placing all your chips on one Tik Tok Creator where it could flop you could try it with like five or six um and then I also think even if you don't have the resources to do that like there's nothing stopping you from creating like multiple social channels to test um I don't remember what the Ecom company was but someone was posting about they had created like dozens of different Tik toks accounts for their brand and they had just like ruthlessly Tex tested different brand in product creative until they figured out what hit and then they doubled down on that right so I I think even if people are running a lot of iterations and Cycles they're doing it like within the same like platform or Channel rather than really being comprehensive and kind of going to all ends of the internet to figure out there are a lot of people online and there are lot of people online in a lot of different places and even if you know that like a certain cohort is interested in a certain thing the kind of sub niches of that cohort and I realized this as my following was growing like it is easier often to like find a very small cohort within a large community and like go after them blow up there and then kind of parlay that influence into other spheres of influence that are either directly related or tangentially related right um but you don't learn that unless you have experiment with a lot of different things what's an example of that of that happening yeah so um I post these like interfaces every day right um if I post something that is a satirical concept for Instagram like pretty much anyone will understand it because everyone uses Instagram or know someone that's used Instagram but like I did a concept that was pager Duty and it was a pager Duty pag your duty feature where if you didn't respond to your on call ticket it would call your girlfriend and Pedro duty is a app that really only developers and Engineers primarily people that work at large technology companies would know right so in posting that I got a lot more comments likes responses follows and DMS from people that worked within that Community um I also saw I don't remember their name but there's a account that does something similar to what I do but they only do it for like rocket league and it blew up right um so I think I what what I learned from that is like if I want to go after a specific Niche or if I want to like tailor my content to people like go to where they are I you like find the apps that they would likely be using um and then you can kind of you're kind of like throwing them a bone comedically it's like okay I know this joke isn't going to hit with a lot of people but I know like it will really hit with this audience um but then there are other creators that realize like oh he can do this then I could really go after like this one this one Niche this like rocket League thing um yeah yeah that's great and I think uh you touched on an important point which is comedy and content and you know a lot of people listening to this are all like how do I get my first 10,000 followers how do I get my first 100,000 followers and you know I think what's interesting about your content is you infuse laughs in it um and you reverse engineer the laugh and you you can do that with the product um meaning like you can create clicks and maybe that's funny or maybe tiny pod is you know funny or or sharable and you can also do that with content so how do you how how do you recommend to people you know who are listening how do you recommend that they structure their well firstly should they structure their content with comedy and then two how do you do it yeah I think it depends on context right like read the room if you're building uh medical technology company that helps people understand their like blood oxygen sat levels you probably don't want to be making satirical Concepts that like you know like it just know the space and so if the if the space that you're working in is like really serious or very heavily regulated you probably want to stay out of being too funny um I think if you're doing something more consumer focused or something that is a bit more LAX which is a lot of things I think so there's the form factor of the comedy and then there's the type of Comedy so those are two kind of discreet things I think I think I still even today I'm still kind of like finding my comedic voice I like experiment with a lot of stuff I know generally like what's on brand and offbrand in terms of like I think of myself as like a comedy show that's like PG that SK used to PG-13 sometimes like people could take their kids to a comedy show that I did on the internet and it's fine right um I'm not going to be making anything that's like like rated R and I'm also not going to make stuff that's like Pixar level like accessible for anyone um so I almost think about when you're doing comedy thinking about like if you were a movie what would you be rated or like if you were a song Would you be explicit or not that's an interesting like framework because it immediately takes a lot of stuff off the table or puts a lot of stuff on the table um and then I think like generally most of my work starts with a real world circumstance or situation and then identifying if and how that interacts or intersects with the technology that we use and then constructing the like joke around that so for example last summer uh we were flying back from a trip and we were super late and we were running to catch our next flight and and this this person like shoved their way through us and like sprinted it was like very aggressive I was like okay I get it like we're going to make the flight though so like don't have to be like crazy about it so um and then in my head I'm like oh like what like I'd fight this person if I had to you know it's like a passing thought like an intrusive thought and I think most people like dismiss their intrusive thoughts but I'm like wait a minute there's like an idea in there somewhere right and it's like okay what if when United over books or flights you had to like physically fight the person for a seat right and then that became like an insane concept that people were like how like what is wrong with you how did you come up with this so I think part of it is just like living and observing life and then zooming in on like points of friction um it's been interesting because like philosophically that's like helps me just like deal with stuff more because I'm like anything that is weird or wild that happens it's like something you could potentially create a bit out of um but I think like once you start like looking through things with that lens it's kind of something that is like hard to turn off um so I think there's that piece and then I think there's the form factor so the there's people like Nick Huber or like Alex Cohen where most of their comedy is like text based right so um I think Alex Cohen and maybe someone else created it but there's the the meme of a company does layoffs or launches some crazy product feature and then he's like I just got laid off I was the PM in respons that was it responsible for and it's like whatever horrible feature um and so there's like like text bits that you can make um and I think anyone can like write right so um I think like the lowest not the lowest form of Comedy but like the easiest and most accessible way is like taking existing Frameworks and then iterating on them so like if you see a a format that is popular like you can jump on that bandwagon right another one is current events like anyone can see a current event then capitalize on it so like I did a campaign with dual lingo where I was just making Concepts and serendipitously like we had just approved for posting the Dual lingo option to serve and translate divorce papers and then like the day after that trau separated with his partner and so dual Linko posted it and uh it like blew up right so I think like reading the room in terms of just like the of all of social um and world events is another way um trying to think what else yeah I think those are the two like good entry points it's just like a good sense of like current events and then also like identifying Trends and then capitalizing and iterating on them um when you see a lot of people that will just yoink people's stuff and post it I think that's like a really low move but um and also it erodes your if you're doing that as a brand it's going to erode a lot of trust um and then I think one other thing and this is more with like brands that are established but I think it is an interesting thing to call out um so dualingo is like known for having an unhinged brand I think like all of us owe a great debt to Wendy's because Wendy's was the first company to be like self-aware on the internet and and like really kind of like go after people um shout out Wendy shout out shout out Wendy the OG and then recently um someone put me on to Ryan a their Instagram and Tik Tok feed is like the wildest thing I've ever seen because people know that they're like if anyone's ever flown R air it's the worst it's so cheap like the seats are uncomfortable like their flights are always like it's just the worst but instead of them trying to like apologize or compensate for that they like take the knife and like twist it so there's like a reel where it's like how to sit and then it's like it shows first it shows a person with like no leg room and then it shows like Benji a dog learn to sit and then it's like this other person a like whoever learn to sit and then it's like you can too and it's just it's just ruthlessly like mocking their customer base which you would think for a lot of a lot of Brands wouldn't be able to do that but I think Ryan a is like in a really unique position where they've identified like here's a sentiment that we have about our brand and rather than like shying away from it even though it's negative we're like doubling down on it because and the interesting thing is people in the comments were actually in certain instances defending Ryan a because flights used to be so expensive that they couldn't fly and even though ryer has like a crappy product it's a cheap product right so um in a way they're hyper aware of their like unique selling point and even though there's a lot of problems that come as a side effect of their unique selling point rather than trying to shy away from those or like protect themselves they're owning it um so yeah that was a bit of a all over the place answer but I think it's a pretty nuanced conversation about how to do comedy depending on what you're doing it's what I wanted honestly yeah it's exact this exactly what I wanted I wanted to crawl around your brain to see how how you how you think about uh you know creating content so that was helpful I want to move on to for Real Estate Pros because I didn't really expect you to have a real estate idea talk to me about that idea I think so I mean it's interesting right because people are going to like tune into this podcast they're be like what am I listening to so we don't need to spend too much time on this if we don't want to but um like every other person that had a little bit of money to invest in the 2010s uh people thought they were Real Estate Investors um I've done a little bit uh primarily in like single family rentals um but then last year and I haven't really posted about this but I dipped my toes into the Airbnb market with the first property and I think there Airbnb generally has a great platform for guests obviously they have a good General platform for hosts and then companies like local prop management companies and then companies like vassa are kind of going after the idea of like TurnKey management um and then you also have like a data Ator platform like air DNA which is trying to kind of pull higher level insights for people to make like Market level decisions on what's up and coming what's slowing down and like just general sentiment analysis um I do think something that going through the process has been painful for myself is like tax optimization and hyperlocal services that are um really comprehensive in helping you understand the financial picture and then walking you through that and digitizing a lot of it I think part of that is just the Nuance of working like loc local to local um but I do think like right now we're seeing this trend where I mean I think like Nick Huber is an example of this and there's other people like that where they they talk about like boring businesses which is more generally something super low level like anyone can grab a lawn mower and start mowing lawns um but I think if you start to digitize that or any other kind of manual business like that it it becomes a lot more appealing to kind of the next generation of people like if I needed to get Plumbing work done like we ended up working with the plumber that we work with because they primarily communicate via text and have a really good digital experience right like a lot of people just don't have that and so I think with some of the intricacies of prop management and specifically as it comes to Airbnb and navigating the the local stuff so everything from like Pest Control to um Landscaping to taxes all of those are like disparate pieces and often components of that are still very manual or physical um or if not they're actually not all like bundled into one full package so I think like people that really could roll up multiple kind of like boring businesses stacked on top of each other and then like brand it into one service with a really smooth digital experience I think just generally anything in the real estate space there are a lot of people competing in terms of providing like a good customer experience but the idea of a good user experience is still something that is pretty suboptimal um and so I think it's like a longer term play and you'd obviously need a little bit more Capital but even starting with like one component of that um process and then like perfecting it I think you could either go broad right like you could specialize in one component of that and then go across an entire Market or you could really go hyper local and try to dominate one specific Market by like stacking all the services on top of each other and providing a best-in-class experience I think there are these like larger air Airbnb prop management companies that are trying to go Nationwide and the reality is they don't understand the intricacies of the local market and from what I've seen in a lot of local markets is that they have like one or two very entrenched players that handle most people um if if they do it all um and so I think it's just an area that's like still rip for a lot of competition yeah so like we often forget real estate is like multi-trillion dollar asset class and the way it the way we interact with it is still so archaic and it's crazy because people have been actually like I've heard people say that exact same line like 10 years ago 15 years ago 20 years ago now but it still kind of kind of sucks to to find a plumber or manage your Airbnb or what have you I have a someone who like manages my my vacation home in Quebec in like the mountains and the guy doesn't text A B he doesn't speak one word of English not one word I thankfully I speak some French but I prefer to just you know being you know waiting in line for a coffee and just texting in English versus like calling him up doesn't have a cell phone I have to call his hom line it's like crazy right so I think what you're saying is is the The Experience needs to be digitized but it also needs like the nuances of what like genz and Millennials expect from from a product because these are people who grew up on Instagram people who grew up on Tik Tok so the product that they're used to need you know need to have some of that um some of that jazz I think I think there's a couple components too I think part of it is also education so you can learn pretty much anything you need to but a lot of that knowledge is still like going onto a government website and then reading an FAQ or like downloading a giant PDF and reading that and there's a lot of people that go after the same content type so there's a million people making content content about how to make a cool like dashboard design in figma but the level of intent and production around more of the nuances of like oh okay if you are filing taxes for an Airbnb here's what they're taking away out of the app transaction and like breaking that down like you're a 5-year-old right like there I think part of it is like seasoned people are going to figure that out and they're going to go through like a couple of reps to learn all of those things but I still do think that just generally education curriculum around more historically complex areas is something that there's still opportunity for people to invest time and resources into and then I also think that even in the last couple years like Tech has progressed so much so fast that the example of the person that manages your um company or your sorry your house even if they're not so let's just imagine world where they do text or someone else that has someone that they do text but they're texting in a different language like realtime transcription of language from one to another is something that is basically doable now and so the idea of oh I used to have all these service people that didn't speak English and and coordinating efforts with them was really difficult and now it it really is one language you can you know pull whatever input you need to an English it'll be spat out in French um and vice versa so I think those changes have really only come about within the last couple years and so the taking all of those things and then packaging them into an experience I think it's like anything you're just going to need to kind of continue to run to Run cycles and improvements upon it and I think yeah 10 or 15 years ago manual businesses and doing anything real estate was really really rough and I think there has been a lot of progress but there's always progress to you need yeah and I think you know the way the way you figure out where the progress to be made is is you actually go and do the thing so you become a property owner and as you become a property owner and you rent it out you look at all the different products that you're using to F facilitate it and all the different pain points you have and just write out all the pain points like the big idea of becoming a property owner isn't necessarily the you know the real estate in my opinion it's it's figuring out all the different pain points in the real estate process the different products that need to be made and then figuring out how can I make this in a user experience so that it's so seamless and and it's going to make you know the existing product feel like so Antiquated and then you go and like spin something up yeah yeah I think I think part of it is by either feeling that pain yourself and then documenting or I mean likely a lot of people are like I can't just go start like buying up properties right right I think if you do want to get started in that space specifically like I think there's something to be said for working in the space like working for a product management company and even if that's even too like high lift or high commitment I think there are a million different like message boards and forums you can look at across the internet where where you'll see people um experiencing any number of frustrations or complications um I mean there's like the the idea of like Reddit unbundling right like the whole products have been spun up by like people picking up her Reddit threads or talking to people about the space and and like gaining a deep level of understanding about the space by surrounding yourself with people and and learning from those people so I think even if you don't want to kind of put yourself in the driver's seat of having all the responsibility of owning a thing and then managing that thing and then figuring out all of the pain points surrounding that thing and then going from there there are ways to move in that direction and expose yourself to that space without the the risk and upfront investment that that would typically require totally like the minimal viable product for building something in the space isn't going raising money or taking your own money to go buy a property it's teleport yourself onto places like Reddit onto Twitter onto Facebook groups learn as much as you can through through that through the problems but then suround yourself with a group of people who who have been in the driver's seat because you need someone in the driver seat to really understand the nuances so that you can incorporate it into the product so I totally agree with you most startups could launch you know for under $100 and are just a weit list and a landing page um to get to get some interest so I think in real estate too I I don't think that's the case um I don't want to leave this conversation without the third sort of set of business ideas which is business ideas startup ideas in the design space you know you spend a lot of time with design tools you have a deep you know a deep relationship uh with the design Community as in a lot of designers follow you and and interact with you so where do you see the opportunity in terms of uh you know building startups businesses for platforms design platforms but also uh for the design Community yeah so I think I'll tackle this in two things like first I'll start with like I'm a designer and I want to start a business what should I do and then I'll do like I'm a Founder wanting to serve the design space what do I do um individual designers I mean there are you can kind of go any route I think like as a freelancer you and I know this because I lived it like anyone that wants to start freelancing you start from nothing unless you were born into a like long line of respected designers which like isn't a thing with product design um but you start and you have no leverage um so I took on my first job it was like I probably worked like a couple days like literally like 48 Plus hours like learning After Effects and all that stuff and it was a project in high school that I did for a friend and I made like 25 bucks and got into a concert for free it was like a lyric video for a band um but at the end of that I had a project and I had social proof or like a testimonial from that person that I worked with and I was able to use that to command a slightly higher rate and then I did that over and over and over and over and over again for a decade and like throughout that I identified like I want to do this type of work I don't want to do this type of work um so for people that are like I want to start freelancing but I want to increase my rate like how do I do that the answer really is you do a lot of work you build trust with a lot of people and you get referrals like and then you put in the effort for a really long time I think if you want to build a business um was having this conversation with a friend yesterday like there's creative resourcing or creative resources and tools which I think is a really difficult uphill battle to fight but you can make icon packs you can make illustration packs you can make website templates you can make app templates I think the reality is people are looking for like custom bespoke stuff like yes a lot of people will pay for site templates like I know there's a guy on Twitter that he makes site templates on framer and is doing really well for himself and then there's like I think craft work or invado there's like these aggregators like I think trying to go at it as an individual is really tough because you're fighting against the distribution that these huge platforms have um that's where if you are really good at like icon illustration for example going out as like an independent designer in doing that like it's Bonnie Kate Wolf like she did dis icons for Discord for Netflix um really specializing there is a a small client base for that but if you want to be like oh I just make and they're kind of generic like you're going to be fighting against an aggregator and that's really tough um there's knowledge products so like Brett from design Joy has a course about making an agency I think the hard thing there is you usually have to do something that creates a lot of social proof before you can build and sell a course um same with educational products you have to have a lot of experience um so I think for a lot of designers a lot of designers like want to have have like a cash flowing business like right out the gate and I think realistically like I would encourage people to become really really strong designers before they do that um and then by doing a bunch of different design work you also figure out what you like and what you're good at and then you can lean into those things more and when you do decide that you want to make a business around those you'll often have more skill and you'll be able to execute faster at a higher level of quality um rather than like spinning your wheels on trying to create a business business when you haven't developed a high enough level of expertise um on the startup side I think like so there's like the tooling that people use every day right so it was Photoshop then it was sketch and then for a hot second it was Invision and then figma came up and like ate invision's lunch for lack of a better way of saying it um and then figma is really the dominant player in terms of collaborative product design and like web design tooling I think Adobe still has its place in the world like I still use Adobe products like I think especially with the AI advancements that they've made like I my wife was working on she designs stuff as well um she's more on the marketing side but she was designing something yesterday and I showed her the like quick select and then you can generate a prompt like change someone's jewelry and it's just I mean that used to take a compositor hours right and so I think figma and Adobe will have kind of both their respective places I think they're both enormous companies and they're both set to do really well um in the coming years I think in terms of like where things are going I don't have like a crystal ball where I know what's going to happen I think there's like interesting Trends so it used to be that designers became so designers in like agencies became ux designers or UI designers and then slowly over the 2010s that title converged into like product designer and now we're seeing this world where like front-end engineering or researchers or product managers one of those kind of components are fusing with product designer so like design technologist or design engineer is a popular term where it's a designer that can design things but they can also prototype them um so I think the disciplines are going to collapse more I mean economy capitalist Society things are efficient and so it's going to find the most efficient way to get things done which is often like a hybrid PM designer or a hybrid designer marketer or a hybrid designer engineer um so I think the question becomes who's building the tooling for a designer and a marketer arguably it's Cana um who's building the tool for a PM designer I think that's a really interesting question because there's a lot of like data and insights and research aggregation I actually have a friend so shout out TG he's working on a startup called divinate which is like an AI based um research tool for designers and product managers um and then things like Swift UI um for sell uh there's a lot of repet there's a lot of companies working on design engineer or design engineering tools um in terms of how to or what to build in that space I think there's also a lot of really interesting stuff happening in the Gen space like Photoshop has so much baggage from 20 years of being a photo editing and compositing tool that um don't remember what the tool was called but there was like a recent design tool that came out that was a really interesting like way to generate assets quickly edit and improve them and like cycle through iterations um and so I think that space is still very early and I think we're at the point similar to like what I talked about AI Hardware where a lot of people are like throwing a lot of stuff at the wall in terms of gen and I think we're still trying to figure out like how to correctly augment and connect to like the current designers workf flow right because like figma was a step like better than Envision and so it was a natural thing for like the whole industry to shift I think the needs of the industry now are there are more fragmented needs and so I'm I'm guessing like Niche products will pop up around the design marketing design engineering um design and product use cases um and then also just gen AI on top of that I think it's probably more helpful for me to give that summary of the space as someone that is in the space rather than me telling every person listening to this to build a gen startup and I think I think I have a better sense of like how the individual designer should do it rather than like Oh I'm a tech founder and I'm trying to figure out what's to build I also think that whenever there's a new role that's created like design engineer There's an opportunity to build content Community paid Community around it so for example Lenny ritky many people know him multi-million dollar year business servicing product managers but who's going to be the Lenny ritky for product Engineers yeah yeah I think that's right design Engineers sorry yeah yeah well there's like a lot of design content and there's like a lot of how to code content but it's like designers coding there's less there um so I think you're right like people starting to meld those and build community and content around those is a a huge opportunity yeah I also think digital assets you mentioned that in the beginning around templates and and stuff like that for platforms is one of those things that there's always opportunity to create those things um but you are right the platforms make it harder to you know unless you have a big audience to sell so there I but I still believe that there there's like a you know tremendous opportunity still uh in those spaces and I think the way to think about it is you know maybe don't create a WordPress theme because people have been creating Word WordPress themes for 20 years and it's probably saturated at this point like what's the you know what's something new uh so you've talked a lot about framer in the past you know that ecosystem is growing very quickly web flow that ecosystem is growing very quickly how you create stuff for them yeah yeah I think that's right and I even think like designx code is like one of the first people to really like package design and coding tutorials is like one thing but I still think there's a lot of space where it's like there's not really a place that I know like oh as a designer you should go to this place to get this like kind of custom component for xcode it's like oh you're building this app and you need like a custom nav bar like here start with this thing right like maybe you pay five bucks for like all this boilerplate Swift UI that looks really nice and is like a a level better than a lot of the outof the boox components um but I think like you said it's like people are just now there's just now a level of critical mass of interest there so I don't think people have like started to invest in like the content Community around that opportunity it's why people listen to this you know ding ding ding all right sain Iverson it's been real thanks for coming on the show you are the the Larry David of of design Twitter in a good way that is a great compliment so and where could folks find out about you and I think you have a a new book coming out too so maybe you can plug that as well yeah so I mean you can find me basically wherever you are on the internet X Twitter whatever you want to call it threads link in uh Instagram sometimes Tik Tok I'm still I still don't know how to use Tik Tok so bear with me um and then yeah I'm working on a book so as we speak I have the pre-orders for the second version up like if you go on any of my Social Links you'll be able to find that and pre-order it and then um those should start shipping either late February or early March amazing I love it I'll keep following I I I I'll grab the book I subscribe to you on Twitter and the email uh as well daily ideas it gets me going as someone who I mean I'm in the business of creating new Concepts through one of our one of our businesses which is called LCA and it's an innovation agency so we work with a lot of the companies that you you mock up stuff and that's originally how I how I actually I heard about you oh really yeah one of the one of the big companies that we we do Innovation product design work so we like invent the future some of the biggest companies in the world and one of them um I was in their slack they invited us into our slack and they sent sent something that you did and I was like who is this guy and uh I've been hooked ever since wild yeah so thank you very much I'll catch you later man thanks for having me

I think sometimes internet creators worry too much about capturing every little bit of value that they're creating I mean I do this with books too I have two traditionally published books but before that I released seven self-published ebooks on Amazon and the amazing thing is as an independent Creator you can do both you're not signing exclusive contracts you know they're like oh let's leave gumroad and go to some other platform cuz we can pay 3% instead of 5% or they're like oh we can self-publish this ebook we don't have to pay the publisher all this percentage and we can keep it for ourselves I love that sort of self-reliance but I think sometimes it really makes online creators be blind to huge opportunities to essentially leverage the media platforms of the world to spread their message so before we begin I must say you did one of the smartest things that I've seen an author do in your book building a second brain um which was you said in your book that if you want the bonus chapter you'll email it to people so you essentially use you put a lead magnet in your book totally oh yeah I that was essential that was essential it makes no you know the whole project doesn't almost doesn't make sense at least financially unless you can use it to grow your audience and you know sell them courses and other things so that was that was an important part yeah and I I think about that often because I think about like lead magnets and I call them Community magnets which are basically lead lead magnets where you're bringing someone into a free community in exchange for their email address and I was like man this Thiago guy that's when I realized I was like I need to get this guy on my podcast because this guy knows what's up and so I'm excited to talk to you uh we talk about business ideas here so I'm excited to talk to about business ideas and I knew you were one of us when I saw when I saw you put that lead magnet in yeah I feel like we've been we've been sort of orbiting in the very much the same circles I mean I've come across here especially on uh your your content on X so many times uh so this this just seems only natural I appreciate it man I appreciate it and I actually reached out to you um which I encourage other people to do like I I saw your book in a bookstore here in Miami called books and books and I think I just sent you a message and I was just like a picture of of the book and I was just like like great book or something like that something so and you responded I was like whoa this guy responded it just goes to show you that you know people have their DMS open a lot of the time and and it's sort of worth reaching out to people and you'd be surprised who responds oh absolutely uh so many things have come into my life both professional and just personal from that I mean it's kind of crazy if you think about it we all have mostly direct messaging access to each other and to almost anyone and we barely we really barely use it I feel like that's right and that's kind of a good segue into one of your startup ideas which is acquiring a small business and growing it using your your what you've got a few hundred thousand followers at this point so what do you mean by that what type of business would you consider acquiring yeah this is one of my little uh kind of side projects uh at least for now uh I guess I've been bitten by the uh the bug this is kind of like a you know like a trend I've I've come across a number of times you know people like Cody sand and uh Michael girdley and and others and uh you know for the longest time I couldn't even fathom that possibility because my one business takes up 100% of my bandwidth and more and I was like how are these people like running multiple businesses um but now I'm starting to see you know it's a combination of like having operators that you hire to run them or you know using the same team for one business or some of the same team as another or having them be mostly you know sort of passive businesses I kind of get it a little more now and what's driving it is basically I mean it's it's partly a a desire to diversify you know I have we worked recently with a financial adviser this a funny story uh like an independent financial adviser that charges you a flat fee for like three or four calls and he did this comprehensive analysis of our entire Financial life like your your total net worth and everything and uh and he had this software that he used that you input like every single asset you had every credit card every debt every everything and at the bottom of it if you don't include the business like just include everything else but the business our net worth today my wife and I in our late 30s is a big fat nothing it's like our debts which is we have we have no personal debt or credit card debt it's just like our house but we live in Cal you know Southern California cancels out every other asset that we have which essentially means that that we're you know that our the business is everything I have all of my financial life in this one business and the way the world is going with pandemics and wars and different things like you know it's dangerous it's dangerous to live that way so I'm just interested in moving into something that is complimentary or even like counter cyclical to an internet-based business uh you know should the internet go down or should online education go down I can you know survive basically yeah you know you want to hedge not that you really want to hedge but like obviously we hope I think your business is only going to compound but the hedging piece of around like you want to hedge and diversify basically is what you want to do you want to you want to earn you want to buy something that has cash flow that is not related to your current business um but that could be supercharged by the asset that you built which is your audience exactly exactly that's the thing too is is with an audience because an audience is just relationships right they're not single purpose they're not single use um so you could conceivably diversify away from an internet business but using the asset of your relationship with that audience as the means of diversification so it's not like you have to go and start over completely from scratch right um I'm also I've seen all these people you know like Kevin as speedy2 and others who are like basically getting this fire hose of attention you have as an online Creator and just like plugging it into even an established business that already has operations that just needs more clients that is a really powerful model I think so I think the way to I would think about it if I were you is you've got like you know few hundred th000 YouTube subscribers 129,000 Twitter subscribers uh followers it's like you basically have this ecosystem of almost half a million if not more of people uh interested in the same stuff that that you're interested in productivity you know unlocking your potential that sort of thing and the thing is half a million people is a lot of people um that's a lifetime of people to sell them things yeah now the question is what you know what are you going to sell them is it books is it courses is it paid community and then there's this whole other what you're saying is there's this whole other area and you know what Cody Sanchez and other people are saying there's these boring business is these smbs that your audience might want that you're today you're not selling them that so totally so my so my question to you is you know Cody Sanchez talks about like laundromats and stuff you know like you're not going to buy a laundromat and just like start posting about it on Twitter and if you are that' be pretty funny if you are I think you need a first brain not a second brain you know you got to get that checked out yeah so so I think I think what what if you have an internet audience like yourself like let's just Jam for a second what is a more brick-and mortar or boring business that you could you know buy that's what I'm trying to figure out now I would love any ideas you have I mean I don't know I have trouble with the idea of a completely boring business just because I just I mean even a laundromat I'm sure is a lot of work to manage and I have a hard time imagining like that I would even care enough about a business like that to even be willing to do that stuff um so I feel like it should have at least some aspect that I'm curious about or interested in or that will teach me something and it would be nice if it was sort of not internet based I I really think in coming years we're going to see we're going to see disruptions to the internet I don't know why I have this sense but I feel like the internet is is in this like open free era that may be ending or maybe getting less Dependable uh we're having like different like the great firewall in China and different countries like erecting different you know barriers and all sorts of things so I would like something like land you know something that's land or that's physical and solid that could be valuable even if God forbid the internet was you know was turned off uh but beyond that and being profitable and having cash flow I I'm just doing kind of a wide sweep of the possibilities so why I think you shouldn't buy land and why I think you shouldn't buy something like real estate is because anyone could do that but you have this unfair Advantage where you've now built this audience of these people who now trust you you have the which is rare and so I'm trying to think okay what could you know what could you do and which movement could you sort of latch on to and have you seen have you heard of The Brick the brick device so it's actually this I have one right here it looks like this it's a literally it's a brick so if you're listening to this on Apple podcast or this is you know check it out on YouTube um and it's this really really cool idea and it's it's a way it's a way it's a device for people who have smartphone addictions okay so basically it removes distracting apps and their notifications from your phone so it'll it it it turns your phone into like literally like Focus mode um um and you can set up you know different modes for it um you can set up these custom modes so I have I have a couple of them um it's completely magnetic U my my business partner uses uses it Jordan mix uses it he puts it on his fridge he just leaves it and the way the way it works is you you tap the device to turn your phone into a literal bck brick way to un unbrick your phone is to get up walk to whatever you know wherever the bridg uh the the the brick is and then tap the brick to unlock it so it creates this physical barrier and it creates this friction um how does it do that is is it a software like the software is disabling the phone yeah I think that's how it works and it's I'm sure you've seen people who uh who carry like a smartphone and a dumb phone yeah like and I think it just makes it a lot easier to do this so I look at this and I'm like if I'm Thiago Forte I'm reaching out to these guys who like it's really it's really early for them and I'm being like how can I buy 50% of your business CU wouldn't interesting wouldn't wouldn't this product the brick be interesting for your audience oh yeah I mean I just got one of these a few months ago the Light phone a dumb phone uh and my wife got one too we've been trying it but it's too extreme you know with two kids and at needing to just do all the things that we use smartphones for it was too much of a jump so we've now converted back to iPhones but I'm still personally in search of a solution and I like the I like the physicality of that I like that it's this artifact in your environment that is reminding you that you can create that that bubble of focus exactly and the thing I've noticed with the brick is if I ever go let's say it's on my fridge I ever if I ever go up to the fridge and I grab it and I Unbreak My phone like I feel stupid doing it you know I'm like oh I check I check Twitter or I check my you know I check Instagram like what what a waste of time and so it reinforces this really good habit and I think why the brick would be so cool for your for your audience is a lot of the stuff is stuff that you're already telling to your audience like you can live you can live this right like you would you'd probably promote the brick I mean you'd probably promote the brick regardless um so that's that's a good framework for think about it's like you know number one would my audience be into thish number two what's a nonobvious thing that they're that they would be into so like of course you can build a course of course you can go build a paid community of course you could sell some digital asset but like this is like a pretty non-correlated asset yeah that's nonobvious yeah and I think just like brainstorming from there I really like this line of thinking uh because it's true we so we make we make a def not big but a fair amount of uh revenue from as an affiliate but it's all either Amazon stuff which is mostly books every time we recommend a book it is other people's courses and it's um SAS tools mostly productivity tools but the problem is is all those things are so similar and also similar to what we ourselves sell that it's like kind of a lot of noise there's just like this barrage of courses and Tool tools and apps that they're just constantly being faced with um that that the physicality of that would I think you're right would really stand out just for the fact that it's so different I also think I saw this in my slack today uh that one of our team members has like a a young sister who uh you know she she's I think like 17 or 18 she came home from college and she came she came with her friends just to like hang out at their family house and they they're all like sitting in the living Room reading magazines so like this guy who works for us like walks into his living room his family living room childhood house and see all like these girls reading magazines magazines it's 2024 and so he goes like well why are you doing this like what why magazines and and apparently it's like the cool thing to like touch physical yeah no kidding yeah we recently um along these lines we recently got the uh we took the TV out of the our living room we just took it off the wall and stored it because we noticed we have a three-year-old our oldest is a three-year-old and he was just spending I mean maybe just like an hour a day all combined but I we started noticing behavioral issues we noticed that it was almost like he's addicted to it he always wanted to watch it we noticed that we were watching it a lot and therefore modeling it and it was a rough week or so but it's been it's been awesome like we talk to each other more we my wife and I have like are reading of physical books has picked up uh it's really a really an amazing like one-time decision that then has you know infinite future benefits um but so let's let's explore this I'd love to get basically free Consulting but um how would you think about this like like in theory that sounds interesting for me to reach out to them I'm sure they'd be open to a conversation but then like do I straight up just like ask for a certain percentage and then offer C certain things in return or like what is it's hard for me to even imagine what that conversation would look like I think you go to them and you say hey I love the brick I love this product I think my audience would love it sure I can be an affiliate but there's something about being like I'm a co-owner in this product that is going to make it feel different when I promote something that you know has my stamp of approval so I'm looking for a partnership and I would say you know I'm sure that you're looking for more customers I can help you get more customers but I can also bring friends of mine you know you can bring Greg Eisenberg you can bring Shan pory you can bring you know Justin Welsh like people in your circle so it's not just you it's the multiplier effect of your like crew and I would say how could I own 30 to 50% of your business what like why that range why what is what is it about 30 to 50 I think that you want them to you want the team to have the major majority of the business at the same time if you're going to be a partner in this business and when I say partner I don't mean just like someone who's going to be allowed like a co-founder Creator like my prediction is there's a lot of co-founder creators that are just going to like tweet about a business once and then forget about it like no you're going to actually be there you're G to you know you might have product product feedback that you can give that might be really relevant you know you might write another book and you might include it in that book um things like that that are super super valuable to someone like that and I think that sure could you own 2% like yeah but if you own 2% I'd imagine it's not that interesting and I'd imagine something like the brick is probably doing like it's probably it it it probably has product Market fit with a very small group of people like me and my partner Jordan but probably has if I had to guess less than $2 million of Revenue and so it's early enough that you proba can own a big chunk of the business and they they might say like yeah you can own 50% of 30% of the business but I want a million dollars in which case you say no problem no problem you you get their financials you get their Vision um and then you raise that money privately if you don't want to invest so you're not putting any of your own money you're actually going in raising from because now you have the deal right so now you go to someone like me let's say and you say hey Greg I found this amazing company it's perfect for my audience uh the business is we're gonna run it as a as a profitable business and there's going to be dividends every year and you model it out you know would you be willing to give me half a million do and could you find someone else to give me half a million dollars at this valuation so now you have a deal so you're you're connecting and I'm sure people in your network would be willing to back you because now all of a sudden your creating a lot of value because you're going to be promoting it you have this great business that aligns with it um and so you're also creating value interesting interesting yeah I like that idea but now so these investors uh they would have themselves now Equity proportional to how much they invest right yeah so the way you would structure it is and we're getting into the details but like I think this might be interesting for people honestly um is you would you would you know let's say they wanted a million dollars for 30% of the business and all the advisory stuff that you're going to give you have to come up with a deal with your in your investors let's say I'm the investor where you say like okay of my 30% I'm GNA give 5% to Greg because he's putting in the actual Capital so that's my deal with you yeah so some minority share and then I I could also put in some money right just to have skin in the game uh but then I I think you should honestly I think you should like I think the Creator should put that's another thing I think creators should put money into the businesses that they're partnering with fascinating fascinating this is this is genuinely interesting man and very timely in fact I I was just uh last week I was exploring a deal my first one that I ever even sort of investigated and at at on the surface it looks so good so compelling and then as soon as I I like talked to the broker signed an NDA got the actual financials and it was just such a disaster and I was like oh this is why people get paid to like find good deals exactly exactly yeah so I think this is this is interesting for you but it's also interesting for people who have there's a lot of people listening to this who have products that have product Market fit or a little bit of product Market fit with a devout audience and they're thinking to themselves like how do I how do I grow this thing I wish I could have a Creator uh help promote this so understanding how you think about it is interesting to them too yeah I I almost want to I want to speak to those people for for a minute like to to to tell them what it looks like from my point of view and why I'm even exploring this is like it's like I spend all my time and my team spends all our time creating content and building our audience like that is my my job is to add email addresses to our email list right but but I I've kind of recently this has been a recent realization you know we have like 140,000 people on our email list we send a newsletter every Tuesday and we have 50% open rates so we have the the weekly attention of 70,000 people but we have hardly anything to offer them right like I have a couple courses I have a couple books that's about it and you know that audience will buy some of those things or not or whatever but then we're just continuing to send them incredible free value every week week after week after week all year never asking or rarely asking for anything in return I almost feel like I'm under uh valuing I'm under utilizing uh this audience uh who's who tells us they would like to buy things also they're like do you have can you recommend this or that and we're just like no sorry we're just going to continue to send you massive amounts of free value just because we it's fun yeah I also think that people like you are are looking for things to write about and things to film about so so you know using the brick as an example and talking about that lifestyle and talking about the pro you know the pros and cons of taking you know 48 hours off or taking time where you're not looking at your phone and so it it doesn't even need to feel like you're you know you're you're subtracting like a great product shouldn't subtract from like it shouldn't feel like you're asking you know Gary ve is famously talks about the jab jab hook right like you give value give value give value and then you take and I just don't think that in 2024 that that's relevant to me I think that it's just jab jab jab jab jab jab just another jab like your product should be a jab and I think that with something like the brick some product that spe that is just so relevant to your audience that it just gives you something to talk about that's interesting to them yeah yeah I mean I mean it makes so much sense like distraction is the it's the 500 what's the expression 500 lb you know elephant in the room if you haven't figured that out and mastered that no productivity tip or technique or framework is going to make any difference whatsoever it's like the it's the stepping stone to even being able able to have the space to even think about your productivity that's right exactly so I'm glad we talked about this I want to shift gears to another space that you're interested in which was interesting that you're talking about this especially considering you recently removed a TV from your house but you're interested in producing a TV show and sort of thinking yourself how can I get involved in the entertainment business my question to you is what do you know about the entertainment business uh the TV business and why is it interesting to you why do you think there's opportunity there yeah good question it all started when uh someone from a one of the big Hollywood agencies reached out to us I think if it wasn't for that I I have no contacts or network there I have no idea how to even get started it was the the possibility of someone sort of taking us by the hand there um they reached out through my my literary agent and they were interested in the the material in my in my two books and potentially making that into a TV show basically um one of my favorite things to do in in like the whole world is enter new Creative Media I just love those that first it's like a frontier it's like the wild west you just like enter this new creative domain and you're like you have to question all your assumptions and learn so much and really come in as like a novice with a beginner's mind uh and so over the past Maybe or eight months I've done that just talking to different people in the industry reading articles watching things and I still wouldn't say I have a good understanding of the industry but I have enough understanding to know that it would be so powerful from the perspective of spreading an idea I think that's what I'm most interested in like when you look at what are the highest leverage ways of getting an idea into the hearts and minds of the most people in this world TV is just it's it that's that TV is the medium that runs the modern world um so it could also be you know cool financially could also be cool for other things but I'm most interested in in just distilling and simplifying and making entertaining these second brain ideas which I really I really believe and know change people's lives if they only find out about them and learn them so I have a saying which is capture Hearts first then capture carts yes so I think that's what you're saying too which is if you could spread your ideas wide and far and people resonate with them and they are connected to these ideas then then you're gravy right then there's T like you'll find products to sell you'll you know they they'll they'll take out their wallets but you're what interests you about television is you think that it's a not a hack but a a a great way to spread your ideas faster and it's interesting because you come from the internet like to me you're an internet content creator uh first even though you wrote a book or books to me you're your you know you talk about your newsletter like your your core metric is email so to me it's interesting that you think that TV like why would you spend that time doing TV when you could spend that equal time double Downing on YouTube which is like the new TV to me it's both and they would leverage each other those two Avenues I mean I do this with books too I have two traditionally published books but before that I I release seven self-published ebooks on Amazon and they're they're not in any way in competition with each other in fact I just am constantly getting lessons from one of those routes and applying it to the other um I think I think this sometimes gets lost in the uh the very contentious debates around like oh self-publishing versus traditional publishing there's like this ideological battle going on and the amazing thing is as an independent Creator you can do both you're not signing exclusive contracts ever right so I mean so so it's interesting uh you can look at this from Hollywood's perspective like let's look at it from where they're sitting we're in the midst not only of a TV Golden Era or like it's it's widely agreed upon that this era right now is like the best TV that's ever been created right but we're also in the midst of streaming Wars we have all these a corporation spending billions like tens of billions every year losing billions to try to gain market share right and you look at you read about some of these it's kind of Insider Publications you have to go to but they're competing like there there's a there's shows that that are having like multi-way bidding wars it's like Amazon Studios and Netflix and Hulu bidding against each other right and it's a lot of big names that get that much attention but once in a while you see people who are quite early and quite small really benefiting from that so I'm just like okay I would love to be you know the one the the IP that these huge studios are fighting over uh I'll be the talent you know that is the one actually on camera presenting it and I just see no downside I mean there is time and energy involved but I'll continue to do all the other stuff I do and and run my business um I I I do really I think sometimes internet creators worry too much about capturing every little bit of the value that they're creating and you know they're like oh let's leave gumroad and go to some other platform because we can pay you know 3% instead of 5% or they're like oh we can self-publish this ebook so like we don't have to pay the publisher you know you know all this percentage and we can keep it for ourselves which is I love that sort of self-reliance but I think sometimes it really makes online creators specifically just be blind to huge opportunities to essentially leverage the the the media platforms of the world to spread their message at the very least people should have an open mind right like in general like you should never be I always I always think I talk a lot about not raising Venture Capital because i' spent my 20s raising a lot of a lot millions millions of dollars and I'm turned off that being said last week I had a great meeting with a venture capitalist you know he reached out someone I respect I'm not saying I'm taking his money but I I I think it's important to not let yourself as a Founder as a Creator get attached to an identity oh I'm the not I'm the not VC guy therefore I can't have a meeting with a VC person I'm an internet Creator therefore I can't have a meeting with the you know Hollywood producer totally abely not totally that's such a good perspective yeah it depends on the situation if you know what's that quote if the facts change I change my mind what do you do yeah absolutely I will say on the TV thing I think that the number one reason to go on TV is to get the clips so like I noticed this with like people like Bill Amman and chamath I was like asking myself like why are these guys going on CNB CNBC so much like they have to you know chamath lives in paloo you know it's like he has to like get on a plane go land at like LaGuardia or New York or JFK try you know it's been an hour to get into the city uh stay at some like Midtown Hotel um you know it's it's like he's got kids like probably doesn't want to like do it you know it's freezing cold I heard in New York it's like 20 degrees right now it's like probably doesn't want to do it but he does it because like five minutes later he takes that clip and he posts on Twitter and it gets millions of views or Bill Amman does the same thing I noticed that like it'll go on TV and then all of a sudden right after clip is live and the and the clips because you're on TV because like it's a it looks like TV everyone knows what TV looks like uh there's more credibility it spreads quicker and it's just more viral totally totally yeah there's another another kind of bias of online creators they they seem to think sometimes that markers of markers of credibility or status don't matter or are bad that's crazy you know credibility and Status are are more important than they've ever been because of the flood of information no one knows what to believe or who to trust yeah uh I think I think I mean you got to have both you should sort of you know have your own platform that you control and also take advantage of the The Gatekeepers when and if they come calling I agree man I agree okay you have another idea on here which I'm really interested in which is certifying other people to teach facilitate consult on your IP so you've spent years building this incredible IP multiple books so much content content free content YouTube whatever created a system and I've noticed that more and more people are doing this where they're creating a system and then like the EOS system are you familiar totally um so maybe you can tell people what EOS is or and and if you're familiar with the facilitators what that that they have maybe you can explain that and then explain what you would do to license uh your business and and your IP sorry and why that's interesting to you yes this is so timely this is what I'm in the midst of right now um I just got back from a uh like a B2B which is sort of the category I would put all this in B2B education B2B training um I've just joined a mastermind uh and I was in Atlanta on Monday for that but basically so basically how did I get on this on this track you know at one point a year or two ago I was like I was like how does an idea actually reach its full potential this is this is a a question that really interests me you know a new idea comes into the world let's just pick one like I don't know agile agile software right that's an idea how does it fully capitalize and manifest like the full potential of that idea reach everyone who could possibly benefit give them the maximum benefit yes make the most money of course that's part of it and what's so fascinating is is you know the world of like online course creators which is the one that a part of we are are totally focused on BC that's our whole world we're all about building our our lists and our platforms and you know selling products and even selling a course but that's all B Toc all of it right is finding the customer acquiring the customer selling them something but what I'm learning and and I'm gonna I'm going to be writing about this in creating content because I feel like this is like this big undiscovered secret is the B2B Market I from what I can see has the potential to be far more lucrative far more lucrative it's the world of yeah corporate trainings whether you deliver them yourself or you have in-house on staff uh facilitators deliver them or you certify external independent facilitators or you license it or you give them access to your self-paced program like whatever it is there's a lot of models but these these businesses that I'm starting to study I mean they they just assume thousands of dollars per per person you know every person uh say on a team that they're doing a training for they're going to they're going to estimate like 3 to 5,000 that they're going to make per person whereas as online course creators you know we're like afraid to charge a couple hundred bucks that's right and with internet economics like it's not uncommon to acquire an email address for $1 to2 dollar exactly exactly yeah so so it's kind of what we were saying before we have these huge audiences but the we're we're monetizing them so poorly in general right and then I'm going over to the B2B World which honestly feels like a different cult like a different culture it's like it's like flying to a different country and like you don't understand anything like the acronyms being used you know they're like what is it uh I can't remember the the acronyms right now but like the terminology they're using the assumptions that they make like for example in our world bigger email list is better right our the size of our email list is like our calling card in their world it's all about the quality of the lead they don't care how how many people they'd rather have one qualified lead than a thousand random people kicking the tires so I'm really having to like sort of compare and contrast these two different mindsets and learn how to operate in both of them but the the the purpose of the whole thing is just basically I mean what I really want is my ideas to become part of culture to become part of organizations become part of companies be part of schools be taught to kids that's just my my mission and there's no other way to do that besides you know entering the B2B markets and EO specifically so I never heard of EOS up until recently it's it stands for entrepreneurial operating system and it's basically I met with a friend for dinner and he was like I was like how was your 2023 and he goes well completely transformed thanks to EOS and I thought like he was talking about like a drug or something I was like what what is that is that like a is that like a sister drug to OIC or something like that uh and no he's like no I actually hired this uh facilitator uh who did this workshop and he works with our company to implement EOS which is um basically these it's like a framework for how to how to run a productive Organization for companies I think under 250 employees and he was saying that that there's like so there's a sort of a licensing play there as well so someone had created I don't I don't know the exact story but basically someone created this um this way of doing things they license it out to people who do consulting or run workshops and stuff like that so I think you're on to something around people are going to create IP more license it out to and and then focus on B2B I think that's a really astute point I think that's really interesting I have an idea that I want to run by you in the in the B2B space so I had lunch with a friend of mine who works for one of the largest banks in the world and he was telling me he just got this job and he was telling me I was like how's your first week he goes well you know I've been doing training all week oh what's training like you know I don't know if you've ever worked at a like big corporate job but it's like it's you know what happens is you know on day one or something they make you watch a lot of videos and like slides about a bunch of different topics like how do you be ethical and like oh you can't give like a contract to your buddy or something and it's like a video explaining it and there's sexual harassment things like that the problem with it is people just skip through the trainings they're actually not going through it so my idea is Apple Vision Pro training trainings M so you put on the Apple Vision Pro and we're not there yet it's not going to it's not ubiquitous Apple Vision Pro isn't ubiquitous but at some point it will be and and maybe what you can do is actually rent it to to employees or something like that but you basically say you join you know Wells Fargo like on your first day it's like okay hey like put on these glasses and oh my all of a sudden you're in this world where you know there's a real real ethical case and you actually have to play it out and it's almost like like a game and it's this real world immers immersion and you do it with other people too it's like the social thing so like let's say it's your first day too you're you're there what do you think of this reimagining training and and I'll end that with training is lowkey a multi-billion dollar industry oh yeah be yeah like especially like saf safety training and stuff like that oh my gosh the money these corporations spend on training on certification on upskilling on professional development it's staggering it's staggering um I think it's interesting uh I mean definitely every everything I've learned about existing training is that it is God awful it's like it's like a punishment it's like torture uh because it's not done it's just done to comply with some regulation or or policy or something it's not at all uh learner Centric right and people are used to learner Centric education now because that's the world of online content you know YouTube is education it's edutainment uh X is largely you know depending on who you follow of course edutainment and so people have gotten used to such a high standard of uh of even educational content that you put them in front of a you know hourlong boring slide presentation and they I think honestly struggle to even pay attention even if they they want to um the one thing I'll say that that will present an obstacle is from what I'm finding the B2B world is years behind the BC world it's like it's like at least five years like what is what is peing and trending now in the BC world like today when you go on X let's let's say will begin to enter the corporate training Market in like 2029 2023 2030 that's interesting I mean yeah I think uh that's like really interesting because all you have to do is look at what was trending 5 years ago to be like how do I productize something for that Market exactly yeah so that's really interesting yeah that's a huge you kind of have to you have to consciously Retreat from the frontier of of innovation you know like like you you go on X I know we're both active there like like go look up what was trending on X I mean really like five years ago you know like 2019 to us that will feel ancient it'll feel so Obsolete and irrelevant and not cool and not interesting and if we started talking about it our internet friends would be like oh we that was that's so P but then go talk to your friend in the the cor you know the corporation I I I'm willing to bet they've never even heard of it yet yeah I feel that does that are you like does that Soul suck you a little bit are you okay with that you know I am I'm kind of that actually suits me you know like with with even digital notetaking stuff that's a that's a technology thing I really Advocate people not adopt any technology that is newer than five years anyway you know like I'm on Evernote there's nothing about Evernote that wasn't present in like 201 like 10 um and the reason is the reason for that is I don't think so there's a price to pay for being on the frontier of innovation you know especially when it comes to technology you got to deal with you're you're basically a beta tester you're a guinea pig so things are are buggy they're janky they don't work right they're really complicated and hard to learn um you know that's fine if if you want to experiment with an interesting new tool but for your core productivity tools the stuff that you rely on day in and day out those should be those should be mature tools I think is my my opinion is there any opportunity to be building new productivity software you know so many people have ideas for to-do list or go you know Google Calendar competitors or Rome compet editors is this too busy of a space now or is there still opportunity I think I'm the wrong person to ask because I like from my point of view I I can't there's nothing I'd less rather do than build software in this in that space maybe because I'm just I'm just so hyper aware of their limitations um and from everything I hear when I talk to people who are doing that it's it's brutally competitive you know there's almost a there's almost a maxim that productivity tools have no moat there's no moat there's nothing preventing every every year every few months there's a new hot productivity app you know in fact my theory is that not only is there no moat there's whatever you would call like the opposite of a moat there's actually an incentive for people to leave your product why because the favorite moment the favorite experience of people who use such apps is starting over with a brand new blank slate it feels good you know like like usually the longer someone has been using a no taking app or to-do list app the worse it is and and the more they hate it because it's just crued and so they love this is why there's so many productivity app switchers everywhere is moving to the new tool you get to be like Oh I'm leaving my old life behind and I'm a brand new person I heard through through the grape vine that Ali abdal productivity YouTuber is working on a productivity app I've heard that too what what advice would you give Ali I mean alie's different because uh I mean is he it's like it you know my push back is when you're building a startup when you're building a product you have to ask yourself am I building something that's New York or am I building something that's Fiji and Fiji is there's not a lot of competition this is something I I grabed you know this Fiji concept from Andrew Wilkinson from Tiny you know there's not a lot of competition sort of an island in its own world like you know you could you can be you know you can have your own little kingdom in Fiji now New York City you know if you can make it here you can make it anywhere those are very competitive spaces like consumer social apps productivity apps uh these are very difficult so Ali is about to enter that space yeah yeah I would say I would say he's definitely more Fiji you know he's I from what know of Ali we've become friends over over the past year or two I mean he's he's not trying to raise VC funding have software used by 100 million people and like you know like build it to a billion dollar company or exit or anything he's probably doing it like like most of his other projects which is basically it's a combination of because he's interested and following his curiosity uh and learning what he wants to learn which by the way he'll create all sorts of content on that will make it worth it even if it goes nowhere um and he'll do it because there is a there he has such a huge audience that is so bought into to what he does even even if only they start using the app and paying for it it's probably worth doing right yeah um but it's it's difficult for me to imagine him really putting the resources into it that would be needed to be like a a massive SAS platform one thing I asked myself when I started a new project is how do I win even if I lose yes totally so I think Ally could would definitely win even if he loses like losing could be like a thousand people are obsessed with this product and he creates some cool content around it exactly exactly online creators have that are the best example of that because even if we utterly fail well that that'll be a great piece of content about how we failed before we wrap there's two things I I want to cover one is you recently went on a desert retreat with your wife and you did your you did a year end review and I want to hear about that and the last thing is I want you to leave people um with a book recommendation what's something they should be reading yeah yeah let's see um so year reviews are something I am extremely passionate about uh I've been doing them in some form since 2008 so about 15 years um starting in 2019 I started publishing them and sharing them on my blog uh and that same year I started teaching uh a a virtual work shop called the annual review where we take people through the process that I've that I've kind of halfway developed and halfway just borrowed from Al I mean there's so many people now online you know doing it in various forms uh I just think it's it's just it's so easy to let life pass you by and for the years to just pass by in a blur um I feel like it's this Sacred Space um that I can only do I can do it anytime but it's best to do at the turn of the year because there's a kind of like there's something in the air around that time where you can really kind of like step back you know you're not working as much you're spending a lot of time with family like you can really gain some perspective on what matters in life um and then I just have a series of prompts that I answer journaling you know introspective prompts um I like to collect my favorite things like my favorite books I read my favorite photos my favorite trips that I've taken and this year uh just a month ago was or less than a month ago was the first time that we we did a dedicated trip which I really recommend it's it's honestly hard to find the time to do something like this when especially if you have a family and stuff uh and so we just did it was like two days you know in the desert a couple hours from here out by Joshua tree and in two days you know when you when you have that dedicated time that Focus like we were saying you can do quite a lot and we both came away with such both appreciation and gratitude for everything that's happened over the past year um and like Lessons Learned and wisdom gained from things that didn't go so well um and then our goals and intentions which we could like align that was cool too is like doesn't really make much sense for my wife and I to have completely different goals and intentions that have nothing to do with each other since we're you know everything is is done as a family and so it just let us start the year off with such a level of intentionality like I don't think I've felt before A little birdie told me that you there was you know you've had some you know some psychedelics in in the last little bit where psychedelics involved in this trip and yeah yeah yeah no I'm I'm an open book so not that trip but about a month and a half earlier in October I did my first iasa ceremony uh and I have a I wrote a blog post on it as one does uh it's very detailed and like extensive I think it's like 8,000 words and that comes out in my newsletter on Tuesday cool I like that so I do it's it's way too much to get into here and it did it I did sort of recap some of those lessons they kind of fed into my yearend review but I sort of am publishing them in separate pieces I like it all right man and um how about uh yeah give us your book recommendation and I'm curious what what you're what you're recommending these days you know there's a book that I I picked up it's this one right here it's called signs mhm uh by it's called signs the secret language of the universe by Laura Lynn Jackson um it says it's a New York Times bestseller uh but I've never heard of it anywhere online or off uh I think it was I think my my wife had picked it up and it was just sitting on our bookshelf when I when I found it but it's basically uh about how to notice signs that the universe is trying to tell you and you know I love books that are highly left-brained and you know have a lot of evidence and logic and all those things but increasingly I find over time it's like that left side of my brain is quite welldeveloped like one more book about you know reason and logic is not really going to change my life what really does change my life or at least my thinking is more right right brain things things about intuition about the emotions about relationships about uh faith and spirituality and so like the the content of this book violates every single cognitive [Laughter] bias but as long as you kind of like I have found as long as I hold it lightly that these are sort of this is not the literal truth but it's it's just a one lens through which to look at your life uh it's quite quite interesting and Powerful I'll check it out I love it new thing I'm doing is whenever someone recommends a book I just basically go to Amazon Auto automatically buy it if it's someone I trust uh you can't have uh like I just love being surrounded by books it's such a fun feeling especially going back to the physical thing like having a a physical book and letting it being a reminder for you is just so good so yes absolutely thank you for that and uh where could folks learn more about Thiago and and get get more involved in your ecosystem yeah yeah um building a second brain.com is uh our website for everything related to second brain stuff uh elsewhere our main website is for labs.com f o r t l a yes and that has the blog the podcast and various other things I'd say those two those two are are kind of the portals I love it and I will say I will admit you have probably the best name of anyone who's come on to this podcast and we've done hundred plus episodes so Thiago Forte everyone I love it um thanks for coming on man yeah it's been a pleasure thank you Greg

I raised millions of dollars and sold three companies by the age of 30 I've never told anyone this but to tell you the truth I actually cheated I use five software tools that give me an unfair Advantage so I'm just looking at my list and it's not five business tools it's actually seven tools so you're getting two bonus tools five tools plus two bonus tools let's get it the best part is they're totally free there's no coding involved and you could start using them today if you wanted to I used to keep these private but now you can steal them to build your own million dooll business all right let's get started the first tool I want to talk to you about is called answer the public doing business would be so much easier if you could read minds now we have a long way to get there but answer the public almost lets you do that there's 3 billion Google search queries every single day today that's 3 billion business ideas waiting to be discovered so the first thing you want to do is head over to answerthepublic.com once you're on the site you'll see this big search bar type in a general keyword related to your Niche so let's say you're into fitness type Fitness and hit enter Then the website will generate a visualization of questions people are asking about Fitness you've got a wheel of different categories like what where when why and so on if you click on the what section you'll see questions like what Fitness classes are best for beginners what exercises burns the most calories each of these questions is a potential business idea you can also group these questions by stages from the basic what is dot dot dot to the deeper how can I dot dot dot and then tailor your offer to address each stage okay so the second tool is called hex EXO watch think of it as your AI Watchdog hexo watch keeps us an eye on any website tracking changes from visuals to prices once you're on the site you'll see a dashboard that's where the magic happens think of a website or industry you're interested in let's say you're into e-commerce type in the URL of a popular e-commerce site and add a watch let's say the e-commerce site that you're modering changes its homepage layout or introduces a new feature hexo watch will notify you immediately imagine getting notified the moment your competitor introduces a new product or updates their pricing strategy Spy software like hexo watch can help you adjust your own strategy so that you could stay ahead of the game you're kind of Flying Blind without something like this the next tool is Big spy ads are everywhere but not all ads perform equally big spy helps you figure out what works and what doesn't by analyzing the advertising strategies of your competitors or businesses in your Niche this also gives you insight into what products are working and which ones are so head over to bigy.com and search for ads and a niche you care about so let's say you're into AI type AI into the search bar hit enter FX byy magically shows you a feed of all the ads related to artificial intelligence you see ad creatives ad copy engagement metrics and even the platform that these ads are running on this is a gold mine for understanding what is resonating with your audience but it even gets better you can use filters to narrow down the search want to see only Instagram ads no problem you can do that looking for ads with

I heard Chris Williamson talk about this where there's a success bias where just because you do something good you think you know everything good the beginnings are always the same right find something people really want and you deliver it to them you know you hear you go on Twitter and everyone's got this Playbook they've shared and then you realize they're selling you a course we thought hey if you 10x it cuz you see on Twitter that 10 Xing is the way I very quickly ran in the wrong direction we went from 600 to 13,000 products and that was a great painful expensive reminder around how do you test things before you go invest in them so I could have easily tested from 600 products to 650 and saw that the team was like this is stupid but now it's going back to the basics of how often are you talking to your customers how often you listen to your team how often are you talking to your partners and then as we have these crazy ideas that we know are always right how do we test them before we then double down and really invest in them dude I was going to tell you that the cover of your book is so good it's so good thank you it can also double as a flashlight you can also throw in the back of your you know uh jacket as a bike protector if you're biking the funnest crazy thing about this the book cover it's not by chance and our my publisher did not want to do it they actually sat me down with the top guy at penguin and was like we don't want to do this are you sure and I said yeah and uh what was really interesting if you go look on Amazon or a bookstore there's no green business books which is kind of funny given that a lot of business is about money uh they think it's taboo or bad luck and but we tested it and I also like the color myself yeah and it's green is like go green is money so has a lot of has a lot of good going for it well I I was thinking about this with appsumo where when I started what 14 years ago I was like Star reviews are kind of boring let's do Taco reviews and somehow we still do it right and I think with all of our businesses how do you have a little fun with it or where you look at it you're like H it's kind of little little bit different and uh you know I think over time that we all we do tend to get normalized because it's like all right that's why a lot of the shows look the same and it's why all these backgrounds on YouTube videos now everyone's got the same fake plant and so just kind of being mindful how to differentiate a little bit and and the green definitely is a part of that well I'm happy you're here uh million dooll weekend is the book and so you're Mr million doll idea now so it's it's only fitting that we spend about an hour talking about some of your million dooll ideas I just literally did another million-dollar business say more um you know you sent me this question stuff which was good I like how you sent it to me like 10 minutes before the show like hey come up with really great ideas I mean dude if it wasn't you I would send it like two weeks in advance but it's you thank you you're you're a fountain you're fountain ideas you know I the easiest and best problems are always the ones you have yourself and that's what I always come back to so you ask for some of the opportunities one look for tools to replace teams right like there's a tool on app called cast Magic I think in less than a year they had a million AR so they replace producers for podcast where the software automatically creates all your show notes stuff uh they launched have done super well but these other tools that I think are going to be super big are what are tools to replace outdated kind of bloated software or more expensive software so one of the easy ones I think is going to easily get its ass kicked is Google analytics I don't know how to use Google analytics anymore it's like and then you have to change code and then you have to pay a bunch of money to these agency people who you know DM you on LinkedIn so the other thing that pissed me off and I and I saw in our bill on appsumo and this another way to look at problems look at your bills was DocuSign I it's like non-locked in software that's pretty basic at this point it's almost a commodity but they're still charging hundreds of dollars a month and so in 48 hours I was able to sell $3,000 worth without using any social media uh or any of my email list and in pre-sales to a DocuSign alternative for life which will launch in 30 days on appsumo and then I believe I would I would bet I'll bet a million dollars it'll make a million dollars in a year wow so what's your like where do you think what is the state of SAS right now like where where are the opportunities in SAS is it to basically look at the docu signs of the world and be like I'm going to out compete them in in pricing or is it looking at replacing teams and thinking about how do I use AI to create new new SAS using AI it all starts with a customer and that's where most people I see on Twitter getting wrong like and people you know especially if you're in engineer right you you think all right what's a solution now I can use with this new Cool Tech and no one cares about your Tech and no one cares about your solution they care about their problems and so that that's what I always cut back to which is what are the problems that people are either spending money or time on ideally yourself and then what are what's Tech maybe that can assist with that so you know you can go to absum and it's a really interesting insight into what's popular in software what's becoming popular so I'm just looking at the the website today as well we're seeing a lot of no code platforms still super popular people are looking for more solutions around that uh chat Bots that just do it for you you you see them now and and it's going to be exciting where do you ever use these Bots and they're so annoying it's just like the bot is so annoying it's like a it's I don't I don't want to make a joke here but there's going to be bots of the future and I definitely think we'll see where you're not sure who you're talking to and that's just an obvious one people are going to think of but again with all these things I would try to think about who do I have access to or who is it easy for me to then sell these types of products to and for me I like selling to you know solar preneurs and small business owners like myself um and is that because you're one of those people so you just find it easier to sell to one of those people yeah because I know what a good price for myself you know like there's cly for like 10 bucks a month or 20 bucks a month and you don't use it that often and the text like frankly over bloated so we launched tidy cal.com maybe two years ago and that's doing $3,000 in profit a day at $29 for life and the economics make sense and we do have a team that keeps supporting but if we stopped I'm pretty sure it would stay around the $3,000 if not $2,500 a day in profit and it's a great entry point into the abso ecosystem which is why we build our Originals products other I'm looking at the team pulled together other ideas uh this is interesting so zappier competitors so integration platforms as a service so I think there's there's still a lot of room around like how do all these separate software products talk together uh again for everyone out there who do you already have access to or audience of that you can then easily try to sell these twoos I think so many times people build it and they're like I'm going to go on Twitter now and be like Greg and Noah and then hope customers just magically come or I'm going to spam DM them and that just doesn't work or if it does it's gonna take a very long time or what they say is and I'm sure you get this often is people will reach out to create like creators like us and they'll be like hey you know my product's perfect I just need a Creator I just need a Creator and usually that's not the Magic Bullet yeah I like the idea of the pro like even for yourself so you know people are like well how do I think of a business idea or problem so like you're you're a Creator and you're an investor like what are the things that you're spending your time doing today I mean for me you know you mentioned cast magic I just had lunch with Ramone from cast magic and I'm coming from lunch like I just like I just like finished my sandwich rushed here and uh he's got a great business and he told I was like how'd you get your first customers he goes appsumo and he was saying like yeah I'm looking you know at creators as a channel to to grow and while I think that yes if he had a Creator if you were behind it let's say it could grow a lot faster I think there's something to be said about being constrained and building your own media building your own you know your own community and not being just like how you don't want to be uh dependent on BCS you don't necessarily want to be dependent on creators yeah and but yeah going back to your question it's like what am I focusing on like tools like cast magic I think are really really interesting tools that could save me time make me more productive and unlock the potential I mean I've got 65 people on my team right now so if I could make them more productive and make their lives easier and happier that's that's worth it for me to uh explore I think with this AI stuff it's it what's interesting it's like hey how do you use the software so I can fire you there's like an unsaid thing about that in different businesses where with our we have an operations team where they get the copy and it is more complicated to get you know how do we write good copy how do we get a video for a partner we're like ah let's use some Ai and it's like well that means I'm gonna have to fire Susan we don't have a Susan but if we did it'd be like I don't want to fire Susan so you know it's like ATMs and a lot of evolution technology like 20 years ago the internet just came around which is crazy right and you think about how many trillion of dollars have been generated by the internet and then you have to think okay with AI what what's that same new level that of doors opening up and I can either be on one side and be a victim of it or I can be a little bit more empowered and think about how to take advantage of it and uh it's kind of like you look at salaries there's a reason some people make 10 times more than others because they're creating 10 times more value I saw an article I think it might have been in the Wall Street Journal that said that uh gen Z feels that accountants are uncool and therefore are not applying to like CPA schools and accountancy schools and now they're having to raise the average salary for accountants and and and sort of people in that field and all I was thinking about when I was reading that is like the the most uncool jobs are going to be the first ones to get replicated by AI or software of some sort yeah software some sort I mean I think that's I think your Point's great is that that's also an opportunity yeah right like hey people are having a hard time finding accountants like either one create an accounting school or some way to get them excited maybe paying them twice as much or find a way to create an opportunity to have software that can replace that I I mean yeah [ __ ] like this like taxes suck Most accountants suck hiring still how is hiring not solved it's insane it it's just like d hiring is so hard it is so hard it's like I it keeps me up at night I've been using the site hire mymom.com and I hired this woman she was an EA for like a a professional sports team CEO and I was like wow that's she must be great she quit after two weeks and it's obviously me I'm the problem here but the point being is that like hiring General how how do we not have just an easier way that I'm like doop I need this person to come help us out with stuff there's just a lot of interesting opportunities out there to like okay what's the opportunity a lot it's just finding out who has money to some extent and and what they're willing to pay for or if they're willing to pay for it like you know I I had trouble finding a video editor for my YouTube channel right like I had to post a thing and then I have to sift through things and I have to do all these calls and still kind of interesting like I think there's now you know YouTube video job boards but to be able to have like a uber for video editors or some systems that can make this stuff a lot easier that I would easily pay money for yeah I think AI is definitely going to help there automate some of that like if if you if we have all the data around all these people with their bios on LinkedIn and their bios on Twitter and you know how long they've been there and and the average tenure at this company like how could you use AI to reach out to people uh systematically and then connect the owner of the business of the or the manager with this person so there's a lot that could be automated there you also got me thinking I never heard of hire mymom.com which by the way is just brilliant domain I didn't even need to go to the website to know what they did um D mom's Rock exactly mom's Rock 100% And I think there's a huge opportunity to take businesses that have product Market fit and have an angle like like for example uh you know support Shephard already exists um for remote workers but hire my mom is like a niche of of support Shepard or there's another we called go squared away.com have you heard of that I think we've used we use them apps is that the ones that are veteran yes military military yeah that's actually been really good there's also there's there's opportunity everywhere we use uh howdy. comom have you seen them no what's that so they give you they hire South American developers and employees but they do all the vetting and they just make it stupid easy for you to have full-time dedicated staff and an area so we're on our absum Originals products we're testing them out what what are you here's the opposite question what are you not doing in AI is there anything you're just like you know I like doing this manually the the old school way yeah this is going to sound crazy but writing I actually the only time I write using chat DPT or AI is what I've been doing with with I I have a lot of typos when I write and you know College Dropout whatever grew up in a French speaking place so you know my my grammar isn't awesome so what I do is I I basically write my tweet or write my blog post and then I put it into chat gbt and I say do I have any spelling mistakes and list it all out there that's what I use it for but I don't use it for writing at all cool yeah I don't use it for writing at all do you have other cool use cases I you know I'm gonna be trans I am I'm not a big fan of chat GPT I I feel like everyone's eating it so hard and sometimes I think when people go hard in one way I'm like how do I go the other way right like I'm big you know let's go pen and paper baby like which by the way I just talked to someone who read million dollar weekend her name is McKenzie I got to give her a shout out marry maker.com you know if everyone's going One Direction so she's a greeting card business $50,000 a first year paper it's interesting to think maybe what are some of the businesses are things like that that are harder to go away even with all the tech that's coming like you still you know even with AI you probably have to eat food at some point I mean you're writing a book right you decided to write a book when you could have written like you have 10 chapters or whatever you couldn't WR you could have written 10 blog posts like you went the opposite way well I think that's what I think about books where you I wrote in you know in your pre-doc which I thought was great in terms of opportunities or Trends or niches I don't know all some of the same to me which is like there's everyone's going into podcasting and youtubing and twittering but to write a unique book does take a long time right it it does take a long time and there's not as many of them out there so just something that uh I did that thank God for years ago which led me to where I'm at today with this book but I think in general I don't think everyone Andrew Chen said so many years ago he's like you don't have to innovate a lot you just have to do one thing because I think we have to imagine like I've got to innovate the the book and then the marketing it's like most of that stuff has been solved just find one part of the 10 to innovate and I've really embraced that over the years yeah I think that's really smart I think uh I mean I'm working on like six companies right now so you might listen to this and be like practice way you preach but um focus and just like getting something like focus on one thing get it to product Market fit and until you get that to product Market fit just like don't think about anything else so that's how I think about building multiple companies is like I'm working at one at a time basically that reminds do you know Portlandia you ever watch Portlandia yeah yeah there's a great clip where they go to the cell phone store I watch it a lot and he's like so the phone's free he's like yeah it's free after you paid $99 exactly so I think about that like Focus like yeah of course I'm Focus just like I do one and then I focus on the next then I focus on the next exactly or it's like it's tough it's tough this life to it's like Zoolander when he goes I can't turn what he say I can't turn right or I can't turn left like that's me oh man H what are these six businesses you're doing we got boring marketing.com which is an AI tool that we built for ourselves to build uh SEO optimize pages and content and that a that business is going to throw off two to three million dolls of free cash flow this year which is crazy we just started last year um I haven't publicly announced it but whatever uh boring ads.com we have been sort of applying that same Playbook but through ads uh we've got you probably need a robot.com which is one of the biggest AI communities on the internet uh which is cool we've got LCA which is our Innovation agency so we work with like Dropbox and Shopify and fortnite on future proofing their businesses got that and we've got a bunch of other businesses um dude hold how yeah wow okay yeah well what's your question so oh there's 65 people across all these different things yes exactly wow nice yeah nice and then the majority right now the boring marketing.com is like the the bread and butter uh I wouldn't say it's it's it's it's probably about 20 25% um and is it equally distributed by the way why is it bread and butter like wouldn't it be like you know tacos and meat or like steak and wine like we need to update some of these phrases totally bread and butter is you would think like when you sit down at a restaurant you get bread and butter it's the first thing right so but it's not the best thing it's not the best thing and it's not the main thing either right the main thing is a steak and potatoes well dude it's so funny you know you guys are bootstrapped right isn't this all bootstrap like your money and stuff I was Googling yesterday like what the hell is a bootstrap what is a bootstrap it was like a longer explanation than I can even share here because I don't really know but let me look it up but it's like we all say bootstrapping but it was something like not as obvious and I was like oh that's interesting I learned it actually goes back to like the 1800s oh really I'm guessing it has to do like gold or something uh bootstrap strapping is any test or metric that uses oh no this is in statistics um yeah bootstrapping is a self-starting process that is supposed to proceed without external input to tall boots may have a tab handle at the top known as a bootstrap allowing one to use one's finger or a boot hook to help put the boots on the saying to pull oneself up by one's bootstrap was already in user in the 19th century as an example of an impossible task oh that's interesting I like that I actually like that I'll stick with bootstrapper but bread and butter you're out nice dude H so you have 65 people across all these things yeah wow lot of things how do you stay focus well how do you focus not focus across this stuff so we have GMS and CEOs for each of the businesses so and how did you how did you hire these people well that's what keeps me up at night that's what keeps me up at night um a lot of the folks are like for example the CEO of boring marketing is a friend you know and I know people say like don't hire friends and stuff like that well it's like you trust your friends like there there's a reason why you're your friends with with your friends um and so I say hire friends I say hiring your friends is a great idea just through our my personal network has been most of the hiring yeah I love that I mean it's been definitely at appsumo one of our biggest we've hired a lot of these uh advisers so we go and look at who did the thing at this company that's ahead of us and then we we pay that person a lot of money per hour and then we hire a more Junior person who cares probably a little bit more about appsumo and then they it's kind of a nice and nice merge versus some of these like Elite people that we think one they're not as good and two they're they're too expensive that's interesting that you do the advisory thing I I went for lunch with someone recently Who I Really respect and he was suggesting to me he was like you should pair your team with a bunch of advisers and just pay them monthly he's like Nob brainer so I'm curious we do it across that's exactly what we do yeah so we have I'll just break out the people and it depends we now it's almost everyone in leadership gets a person so uh Anna who runs people we have Christine who's the chief people officer from dualingo Moody Glasgow was the CMO of zapier and glass door he does marketing there's a guy named Colin Gardner he does revenue so he did outdoorsy or RV share one of those um we have there's Raj t smooker g he's more like an operations uh so he he's kind of at a high level Alona who's the COO she has someone who worked at automatic as an adviser and now we're thinking even with other people in the company how do we help them get more advisers because it seems like it's been a for like a 500 bucks an hour or a thousand bucks an hour and the way we found most of them was we looked at the for who worked those companies and I just asked for a referral it's pretty straightforward and almost all of them came through referrals where it's like hey you seem to know this person in LinkedIn can you introduce me to them and if they say no or they say I don't know them you can also ask well who else do you know that could be this role and that's created a lot of these people and do you highly recommend it do you go to them like hey I'm willing to pay $500 an hour or they do you ask them that's what you say okay yeah well we we say we want to pay you I think the best way to pay people is ask them how much they want to make yeah so I have a people I work with and like I want to make a million dollars I was like great let's get you to be a millionaire yeah and there's people it's nothing wrong or or I just like giving people what they want so we do offer like hey we want to pay you for this and with the different advisers they they do have different rates and it's also a different amount of hours so like we have the CFO from MailChimp uh Jenny Bloom and so she has an hourly and you know's got their own hourly but we found it invaluable it's kind of a cheat code because these people already know a lot of the things uh like Moody yesterday he asked us in the in the marketing leaders meeting he said what is what's AB suumo when you tell someone out a bar or you're at dinner and someone's like what's appsumo every single person had a different answer and it's like he's asking the Strategic bigger picture bigger leverage questions that were just so tactical I would say so it's being with someone who's like done it numerous times to be able to really coach us yeah yeah and I think the answer a lot of people have us non bootstrappers have is it's like oh I'll just raise money from well-known people but I'd rather not investors I'd rather people who are do you know who are operators and and who are in the game versus like writing checks for a living yeah I talked to I was inter for a million dollar week and I was interviewing with the a show yesterday and they're they're a software business and and they it is great they're doing their own content you know that worked with me at mint.com it's worked with us at appsumo it's what also teaching the book and these guys are are saying yeah we've got to do this because our investors want to do it and I asked them I was like well what do your customers want to do and what do you want to do they're like oh not that and so I I think that was definitely where my apprehension uh of taking funding on I was like why don't you make your customers your investors I think definitely see maybe in terms of Trends I wonder how that's going to evolve well you have a good story around how you lost a million dollar not listening to customers can you can you share a little bit about that yeah there's I heard Chris Williamson talk about this where there's a success success bias where just because you do something good you think you know everything good right and you forget also maybe how the beginnings are and the beginnings are always the same right find something people really want and you deliver it to them and then you do that again and again and again and again and uh you know you hear you go on Twitter and everyone's got this Playbook they've shared and then you realize they're selling you a course it's like hey here's how bought a real estate business here's how I did my marketing oh by the way in the bio there's a link for a life Mastery course 297 and um you know in the I guess to say as an operator in the trenches you know running a an e-commerce site at appsumo I stopped listening to the customer really well and listening to the team and we we had we have about 600 products on appsumo software deals at any time and a lot of them are like the latest ones like as you said cast magic and so we thought hey if you 10x it because you see on Twitter that 10 Xing is the way uh that we tenx our business and so I very quickly ran in the wrong direction we went from and so we had to hire more people on sales on operations on the marketing and then we went from and then the engineering team built all this stuff for that so I'm only talking about cash million that I lost not in terms of the salary that's probably another million and so we went from 600 to 13,000 products within six months on the site and our Revenue stayed the same but our profit went down right because now uh we have different margins so some products have better margins than others so we went from normally like a 50% margin give or take now we're down to like a 30% margin and our customers were livid I saw on Twitter and they email me and that was interesting the team at appsumo was mad because they're like we don't want to do this and the partners were mad because they're not getting as much exposure and then I decided to also spend a million dollars cash to promote that we have all these new products on appsumo and that was a great painful expensive reminder around how do you test things before you go invest in them and I think we all everyone thinks their ideas are unique and their approaches are unique and the reality is probably not probably not like I would say opening eyes it's like kind of unique but even that like we've had chat Bots 10 15 years like now it's like a little better of a chat bot and it could do a little bit more than Google search but it's not like crazy and so how do you test this stuff out so I could have easily tested from 600 products to 650 and saw that the team was like this is stupid the customer said it was stupid and the partner said was stupid and so the in all of our businesses we're going to fail and frankly the more you fail the more it leads you to somewhere that actually works and we've had a lot of that too but now it's going back to the basics of how often are you talking to your customers how often you listen to your team how often are you talking to your partners uh and then as we have these crazy ideas that we know are always right how do we test them before we then double down and really invest in them so we had this website that we put up if you go to meat dispatch.com you can you can check it out it was Meet meet is that like a dating site no it's like a dating site if you want to meet designers for your team get it's basically on demand designers oh dispatch yeah exactly up to 60% off and we put up a website really quickly okay and it my opinion wasn't really converting that much but that was just based on my own gut and feel like I was look I just saw some slack messages I was like you you know when you you build something and it's scales really quickly you're just like like you know it's a seven it just instantly scale to a seven figure business and we never updated the web web page and then I came in there bowling the china shop go going to the team being like we need to redo our website like and I wrote this copy which uh I'm reading it yeah and now we're testing to see if it converts more but my team went to me and they were kind of like dude you got to like take it one step at a time like what we should have done you know it's so different and there's there's and it was a lesson it was a lesson for me to like it's cool to bet boldly but you want to you want to have a plan you can't just like press the nuclear button when you have something working well yeah I mean I literally wrote a book on it not the book but one of the books I'm curious though so one you're so much cooler than I realized we've never really like gone deep or deepish I love that you're doing all this stuff I this is super cool most of the people that have had I'd say the most success to me have also tried the most things right and then they find the thing that works and they stick with it for a long period of time how do you decide when to start something new and like maybe can you share more of the things that you've done that that no one knows about or that you never that didn't get much traction yeah well I think uh there's one thing I did uh with with my team that not many people know I did which was when I was in my late teens and early 20s I built the a network of the largest financial communities on the internet so we built a a business called Wall Street Survivor and Wall Street Survivor was the largest real-time stock market on the internet and it was right after 2008 When people's net net worth went down 50% because of the crash and we were kind of like wouldn't it be cool to like have play money and turn buying in the stock market into a game and then we did that for ourselves and then we powered you know all the big brokerages like Scott trade and TD and every newspaper who ran a challenge a stock market challenge and then we said hey wouldn't schools want to use something like this and then all of a sudden 80 plus% of the top us Business Schools would pay us to power their Finance curriculum so that's something I did that not many people know about H is this still yours this Wall Streets survivor.com or did you sell it we sold it to a private Equity Group can you share how much well actually the company we took it public in Canada then we privatized it because it was getting promoted by uh uh stock market like manipulators penny stock Traders because it was essentially a penny stock we had to private we spent $2 million to make it go public then we spent $2 million to privatize it and so that was crazy I know I've never talked about that publicly and uh and then we also and then we sold it to a private group and do you know how it's doing it all and and roughly how much you sell it for uh I would say I mean it's probably doing you know it's eight it's probably an figure you know it's an a fig profitable business the team is probably 50 or 60 people now I'm not going to disclose how much I sold it for but you know it was wow it wasn't uh it wasn't a home run but it was certainly a single I depends where I sounds like a double or triple to me I mean I think what's crazy and I've seen it with this book and with my YouTube channel is just how many different ways you can get rich right even on the web right like you me non-web totally you know it could be books it could be local businesses but even within the web there's just so many categories yeah even in cont creation right I think you you've probably seen Kevin asiru the Epic gardening guy he's been a long time buddy and I really do think it's it's finding something that people want but also really I think what doesn't get talked about is sticking with it yeah like it I'm sure you've tried things that like boring marketer did that hit right away or is it like you had to try a long time for it to hit so when we like our version of an MVP is an audience or community so when we started uh boring marketing we created a a Twitter account called boring marketer at boring marketer and we would you know our whole thesis was you know if Cody Sanchez is the queen of boring businesses who's going to be the king of boring marketing you know that was the thesis and so we started just tweeting about it costus zero to create a Twitter account so we just basically started tweeting about this concept of boring marketing what are boring ways to grow your business and then we started tweeting about SEO and then we started tweeting about AI SEO how to do it and then people really all of a sudden we had 5 10 15,000 followers and then we were iterating on this tool this to to go and Implement while we were validating so we always start with the audience or the community have you ever built like from like day one with the customer or like sold to a customer at all or done validation without because I think people what what I always hesitant on is like building up an audience and then they don't actually want to ever buy anything or spend money on something yeah yeah so that's that is a fear of mine which is like is this audience the same people who are going to be uh customers so I have this I have this funnel that I talk about which is like it's called the ACP funnel audience Community product so I usually start with an audience Twitter Instagram Tik Tok build up like it also allows you to be clearer about what it is like how to position it what it is I'm building and then I usually convert a small amount of those people into uh a free community and those people that I convert are generally people who I think are going to be customers so those people I'll either put in like a WhatsApp group an iMessage group a a free school or something Circle whatever and those people I'm iterating with in real time and what has been your approach about what you sell to them um my Approach I think it's I it's it's my Approach is honesty and transparency which is like like I'm one of you and I'm interested in let's say boring marketing and I'm going to sh my learnings and add value and hopefully you're interested in this too and turns out if they're interested in it they're also assuming that they in this example like these people have purchasing power assuming they have purchasing power and they're your ideal customer profile then that this this funnel works pretty well I guess I I've lik to approach similarly but ideally I'm the first customer or at least problems that I'm interested in and then I like making sure there's validation with other people before I want to build up an audience of something I'm not sure of but I like the idea of getting validation early whether it's on a Marketplace whether it's through your pre-selling or whether it's through landing pages and then building the that product out for that those people and the audience at the same time different approaches to get to probably similar destinations I think the other thing that you highlighted which I got to call out and this is something I've noticed especially with the book how do you get your customers more engaged with the the business right there's normally like a separation I think has happened and it's the same thing with if you think of celebrities remember celebrities where we literally could see on TV and People magazine and now every celebrity has a podcast right and then they have like social media where you can DM them and leave a comment and maybe they'll reply back and you post that reply back as a comment for yourself as social media and so what's it's a great reminder for me and I've done it with appsumo done million dollar weekend done it with you know things I've done over the past decade it's like have people a part of the process and I love that you're saying yeah just be honest like we tried uh for the book I did a referral program like hey if you I had a launch Team for the book I was like all right bring one person so there's a 1300 person launch Team I said if you could bring one person I'm going to do a pro a dedicated uh office hours I'll answer anything you have in business or whatever you want to talk about just for you and your friend six people did it right so it was awesome though I was like great that's something people didn't want and you could and then I share that back like hey seems like y'all didn't want it tell me more yeah I guess just like I don't have any really friends like I'm kind of in an area by myself so I didn't have someone I could even think of referring that's why I'm a part of a group oh okay or uh every week I share updates of what's been going on from our marketing and I shared here's all the shows I'm coming on this week obviously Greg Eisenberg and come and hang out with him and then I shared as well you guys I don't know if you know this but here's all the shows I'm rejected from here's all the Diary of a CEO uh how I built this rejected me they didn't respond this woman Kathy heler has rejected me three times which I'm like okay twice I get three times I just being mean uh but they love it they love it even you know my whole Facebook I got fired I'm still talking about that 20 years ago cuz the the takeaway for anyone out there whether you're a content creator or a business Creator in all these aspects just include the the community and the audience in the process yes and I know I still text the first customers not every day so I think that's creepy but you know as as part of the thing and even with this book like the customers I'm talking to them hey here's what I'm writing on what do you guys think about it and working with them in the process yeah I think they they want to hear your wins and equally they want to hear about your losses I Remember by the way you know what's even more hurts even more about not getting onto a podcast is getting invited on a podcast recording the podcast and them not releasing it so that happened to me with uh Harry steings 20 was 20 minute VC he invited me to the podcast I go on the podcast I'm so excited by the way this is in 2018 okay I needed this podcast because I was funding my business like myself we had run out of money 2018 I don't know if you remember there was like a bit of a flash crash in Tex dos I was running a social app and social at the time everyone was like well Facebook's gonna copy you Facebook's gonna copy you no one wants to do social apps I get invited I open my inbox I see Harry steings invites me onto his show I'm like this is the number one VC show in the world thank God I've I've made it I go on the show I'm like I do it 30 minutes I think I nail it I'm like celebrating with friends afterwards I'm like so excited for the episode doesn't ever air and then I I you know after a month I sent him a message I was like what what happened and he's like oh we we're not releasing the episode um and I think that the ouches people like that earns trust with your community with your audience with your 100% right one of the things I mean what's been interesting with this book and seeing people read it is that the more that you can get okay that there's going to be rejection as part of this process and frankly it's a learning opportunity it's like okay this person didn't want it why not this person wanted it great and the more that you can get a little bit uncomfortable with that get comfortable being a little bit uncomfortable you just keep going and think about how many other people have said yes but what most people do is they get rejected by Harry or one person and they're like well I guess this is not it right and uh if you can figure out not even figure out if there's fun ways to do it like the coffee challenge is something I've always talked about where you go ask for Discount get rejected you move before and you're like this is not so bad yeah and I think sharing that has been good the other thing I would say that that you highlighted um besides starting a lot of things right like you've started so many things right so you actually have a skill now that you get going you're not waiting to be ready for it and though you stick with it a long time like how long did it take for boring marketer to make a million like a year two years three years uh just under a year yeah wow that's fast that one's fast we had product Market fit right away but you know how many examples like I could share of things that we we we invested a million dollars plus and we're going after it and going after it and so much time you know it's tough to it's tough to it's tough to kill a project right uh it's really tough so uh especially when you feel like you're so close I dude I've done that I feel like that's such a thing where you don't have product Market fit you just add more features until it fits it's tough though it could work that way right there's the we use these exceptions as the norm like oh well slack did it twice right yeah but that's just literally two of the examples where I always I always think of it as like putting stickers on a Honda like it's still slow like just make a faster car if you want a fast car yeah and I've noticed with all of my successes they have started fast like that's you know weekend if not sooner and then the ones where I'm like okay I need more research I need to build more I need to talk to more people just this is a unique one like we try to build a clavo competitor called meat fam spent like I don't know six to 12 months building it I couldn't beg a friend to change over I was like please but this is an automatic clavo you don't have to do anything they're like yeah I just kind of have it set up and I have this guy that that runs mavio and uh you know with appsumo was like all right I got a deal on imra Threw It on Reddit and people bought it right away 12 bucks at a time it's like that's it you know it sounds the same thing with boarding marketer and some of these other approaches that there there are other ways of doing it where you can find out faster of what people are actually excited about yeah I agree I think people stick to the examples of like you know they're on their last dollar and they figure it out my friend Nikita beer was like this he I don't know if you know that story but he basically he hit me up like summer I don't know 2017 or something and he was he had been iterating on social ass for like seven years and like it it wasn't working out so he was like yeah I want to close my comp you know I'm going to close my company do you know anything about getting out an of an office lease and I was like oh whatever happened to that like high school Anonymous teen ping polling app and he was like oh I haven't launch it I'm goingon to launch it in a few weeks I think maybe he wasn't even it was his on his last straw he didn't even know if he was going to launch it and that became like his claim to fame right TBH gas which is essentially the same app and the qu you know so if he if he would have quit that summer he wouldn't be a beer but I look at that and I'm like I don't want to be that I don't want to put myself through that stress personally he would still be Nikita either way I I just think that that's glorifying the wrong Behavior yeah right there's this whole 10x thing and burn the boats thing and I think you can do it that way but you can also do it an easier way yes for like I've I've started all my businesses while I had a day job and I more what I've realized is that there's a lot of smart people in day jobs that don't want to be there but they think they have to be like Nikita and like okay kids we're going to have Cheerios every day or whatever it is that you eat and you have to have this crazy risk we it's like no start a bunch of things like did you have a day job like how did you get going or did you start making businesses right away uh I've just been building businesses right away I mean I started off like I was my dad had a store and I was a cashier at the store and well actually I started off breaking boxes uh literally and that was tough work to be to be doing that and then graduated eventually to be like assistant cashier and then cashier and I I learned that I I really didn't want to be in retail and on the side of that I was like building websites and and love this internet thing and I was just like wow it's so much more fun to be building digital stuff than Breaking boxes or you know bagging product I I would say for a lot of people out there it sounds like we've had similar uh you know earlier careers but yeah you you can have a day job and maybe you like it or don't but at least have that option where you start your own business and for me I I kept getting fired and I was like well [ __ ] man I got to take control of my own destiny instead of letting one person choose my livelihood and so one of my on my third job was like well I'm gonna start building these side hustles and find a system that can eventually work so then I can quit that side hustle when I make enough money and uh but I would say the underlying thing I was calling out again sometimes it just takes a long time it takes compounded time to really get the results of these businesses once they start working you know for appsumo was like we did similar to you it worked right away it was like first year 300,000 second year 3 million but then it was flat you know for a few years like 4 million 4 million 5 million four then uh it started picking up again the market got better we stuck with it uh we doubled down aiming the old CEO doubled down on things that worked and then you know last year $80 million it's crazy but which is it's beyond you know it's bootstrap business it's unbelievable and you know we've made a lot of millionaires and a lot of people have products like cast magic have gone on to do amazing things and that's what we're here for but part of that is we got started and we stuck with it and I think people stick with it like Nikita which is like you're sticking with something not working or maybe he saw some data that was but why not just find something that does work and then stick with just that for a long period of time that's what I've seen especially on the YouTube channel too these billionaires they all took 20 years I was looking at all of the ones I've interviewed and the ones I've worked for it's about 20 years give ever take on average for them to make a bill and it's like people aren't a billionaire and like a month from crypto they give up or they I bought a lot of shitty nfts I kept getting scammed but and it was like a hobby but it was like I think so many people were like I'm not rich off nfts this month like give up but there are a few people who are like hey I really am excited about nfts I'm going to stick with it like I invested in moonpay this guy Ivan out of Miami yeah and they're sticking with it and I could see them ideally you know in a few years it produces a great results but some of these things it just doesn't uh do all of the results at once and so why don't you compound year-over-year with slow you know slow consistent growth that's definitely been my Approach with appsumo coming back in the past few years and uh I feel like we can sustain longer like a boring marketer it's like one million and then two million and three million it's like keep because I do believe in that phrase like easy come easy go yeah and if it's like if you build it really slow and they come really slow then they're going to stay really slow but again you have to make sure it's something that people want not uh like nikito or you know I guess risk it all and at the end God does his work yeah yeah I think uh I also think like it's easier now to build and test and so I think like I would recommend for most people that they put themselves through the stress of hey let me go dedicate 5 10 years of my life to go and take this moonshot swing unless like you're passionate about a particular space um that and you want a billion dollar plus outcome like for us like we're we're happy not having Billion Dollar Plus outcomes totally happy we're not looking I was I was stoked with a million I mean I talk about the freedom number in the book which was I quit my job when I made 3,000 and I think everyone should think about their freedom number when they can finally do what they want you know it's interesting because we think about these people like Edison or James Dyson where they're like I built a thousand light bulbs and the thousandth light bulb worked holy [ __ ] you know so I think one you know he's in the dark a lot so he probably wanted a light to so he could do work right so solve your own problem and I think what what doesn't get talked about with that is you do have indications that people want things so it's easier to stick with it you know I I've noticed with content it's like law of 100 so make a 100 content because otherwise you're G to quit too soon and the same thing with with when I was at Facebook we saw the retention and growth data even though others didn't know it we're like holy [ __ ] this is [ __ ] exploding but no one else knew that and I'm guessing the same is true uh with with Edison and Dyson where it's like wow there V there's something already working a little bit that's giving them confidence same with business like find something people are excited about and then all right at least you have some indication that you can stick with that for some period of time something's working there or will work where I I do think people are like it might work and let me hope for it and I just never I never wanted to approach business in that way so to find business ideas like the only way you find business ideas is basically you go through life and as life happens you kind of like observe things and you write it down I am not as thinking I'm not thinking about business ideas as often obviously with a book I'm thinking about a more just to share with others and give them away I just think there's like unlimited ways to make money and I've chased opportunities so when Facebook games opened up that platform I I had a day job at mint doing their Market marketing but I was like I want to be an entrepreneur I want to get the hell out of here and so I don't play games I don't like games but I can make some apps so I copied the most popular app in in one category that had the least competition which was a uh soccer app and I made a hockey app and I chased it and it it went viral a million users in a week and then I launched a bunch and then Naval wanted to fund me and other people which he ended up doing and um but it was a business that I did not care about I'm not interested in games I didn't play games I like Farmville I hated all those people um and so and then I did another business where I did payments for those games and that made a lot of money but I again hated all these people or maybe they hated me I don't know but I I think it's like find something you're excited to work on for 10 years like I like making content I've been doing it for 20 years I'll do it for another 20 because I love it even if not a lot of people watch or a few because I like watching and I think the same thing with these business ideas I want software deals like on cast magic or on clean shot which is on appsumo right now or an Alfred app which I got a long time ago or remember the milk or whatever new tools out there like I get excited by that and I think more people can think about all right what's a business that I be excited then make sure that others want that too so like for today I'll tell you like two ideas that I really really need frankly I need food delivery in Austin that's healthy they have it in Barcelona it's called the healthiest bcn and for 10 bucks a day they'll bring to your house like very very healthy food that you can customize 10 bucks a day super good price okay when you say healthy food are you talking about prepared food or just like yeah it's fully cooked and it's it's not warm when they bring it but it's pretty warm every single day well do you remember 10 bucks do you remember sprag I don't know if it came you were in SF when that happen when they didn't have it in Austin I know gogin but no they didn't bring it to Austin I don't know if they brought it to Austin soig was like there's all these for me like I've been looking for a solution for that yeah right that doesn't or right now in Austin I need a like a house manager which sounds kind of crazy but I have a painting on the ground my grass is dead there's my umbrella broke off and it's not that I'm too good for it or I can't do these things I'm just a little occupy with my girlfriend AB suumo this book YouTube and I don't want to do that but to try to find someone and interview someone and have them come over once in a while is a pain in the ass and then I have to trust them and hope it works out so again that's a great opportunity and there's probably other people that are busy with their houses too uh now what I've been thinking about though with these businesses is that they're all I think really good opportunities what do I actually want to do though and for me again what I said in the beginning I'm I'm mostly focused I am only focused on businesses that are working that I'm already in so we talked about docy sign I think I mentioned that I don't want to use docu sign or hello sign or any sign and I don't want to pay a subscription so I validated that people wanted it and now I can deliver it to those people and that is something that now our team will then take over David and Garrett and obaldo uh Marne will take it over and then really scale that out but that those are more I think in in the past I would try a lot more things or just do stuff that I like okay cool I'll do it and then throw it away uh but now it's only it's more intentional especially as I'm getting older I'm more I think you probably too I'm more way more sensitive on time and I want to not do meetings before noon and I want to be present for my girlfriend and and our future family and uh being an entrepreneur I think you recognize it well it is a lot of work and now I'm actually working more hours now than I ever have but I'm also more excited now than I've ever been and that's that's available for everyone you know have cool [ __ ] you're looking forward to cool stuff you want to be doing like these things and meet an entrepreneur as well I can have more time to also be off which I feel very grateful about but for everyone out there you also have to start like you want to be a content creator post a thing today you want to make products like Greg go make an audience follow Greg's formula you want to start a business my way great do it my way but at least get started today yeah and I think it's also important for people to to follow what other people are doing understand their models and it might be a mix of like a Greg and a Noah right depending mix that's a beautiful mix I love that mix the uh It's a good-looking kid right there put us on some Baby Generator no because I think what happens Greg and I think that's a great point is they see Greg's model and they copy and it doesn't work and it's like well you're not understanding how Greg got to these decisions like ABS used to be bundled software deals and then we went to individual daily deals and it's not just because that's what Groupon did it's because we literally like had to go understand that we looked at the economics of bundles Andrew Chen put it together here's a bundle economics here's individual individual deal economics here's how advertising could now be implemented in each of those and what that uh return will look like and it was just obvious but you know I think sometimes we have to ask people like how did you get to those decisions and maybe it works you maybe it doesn't but you you go try it and you're like okay this doesn't work let me try something else no I appreciate you coming on you're you're just I'm I'm I'm ready to run through a wall right now like this is this is what I'm talking about fun I mean go find stuff you're excited to tell people about I think that's a big like a big problem like people are like I don't know I don't want to promote things like well then your product sucks or you're not excited about it or you don't have customers excit about it but for me you know this book or appsumo or this new Doc sign alternative we don't even have a website or a name yet so if you got an idea let me know but we people are people want it I want it and I'm like yeah now now I gota go make a business and spend life doing that I don't know I think we we're all figuring out in this planet so have some fun while we're doing it that's definitely what I I would like to get that out there Amen brother million dooll weekend is it available for purchase yet no no I don't know when this is coming out the book drops January 30th so it's it is a business right it's I ran this like a tech company where how do I test different things how do I make sure there's validation how do I run the marketing so I think if people are liking how they they see the promotion and the materials of the book I think people will get good results for themselves I'm reading it so uh I'm looking forward to it and this will come out January 25th so sweet perfect timing and I sent you a VIP Box by the way so I sent you a a million dollar weekend VIP box oh wow thank you I I I appreciate that I didn't get it yet but I will look for it what we just sent it two days ago I know I don't know I'm not yeah it's not as fast as email I'm a digital guy bro I know but also Media Mail in America is a lot cheaper right like there's this like FedEx overnight it like 50 bucks but Media Mail is like $3 for the books and other some other goodies for you said said said like a true bootstrapper dude it's so I'm flying to Spain where we spend half the year and the flight it's like $700 for economy but 5,000 for first class it's like just book it on points book it on points yeah we're going to do the points we're going do the points which that's a whole another thing if you're a bootstrapper create an LLC get points that's not you can expense things but I think the bigger thing is just enjoying the money we do make right if you're G to make some and enjoy it so yes I will most likely use points but if not pay for the upgrade yeah and by the way uh last time we spoke you didn't you didn't have you were looking for a girlfriend so now you have a girlfriend I have a woman man yeah it's a woman friend and uh she's phenomenal we met in Barcelona so we're going to go back there and uh we actually have a baby on the way so we're going to go baby lot of every time I talk to you something new dude I've got you know what's next I love it you that's funny someone asked me that too they're like uh what's next and I'm like honestly just more of appsumo you know being a good father being present and what what's working just keep doing more than that you're full of surprises you know follow Noah Kagan for surprises million dollar weekend thanks for coming on thanks for having me man

got from my community at Community Empire if you care about growing an audience building a community and creating an online business keep watching until the end I'm sure that you will learn something valuable Fox asks any any guidelines for building a paid course I'm writing one for interviews embedding an existing YouTube video with a good answer to an interview question in addition to writing my own mini essays on an explanation and pros and cons basically any any advice for for creating a paid course the important thing is people learn differently some people like live video and live cohort-based learning some people like images some people like text some people like a mixture of it all so what I found to be most helpful is that if you can create a paid course experience that has a little bit of everything I do believe that people prefer this cohort-based model where they have to show up three or four times a week to a particular class I think people are really busy for the most part uh especially when you're talking about like B2B courses like professional courses selling professional content my advice for if you're trying to build a paid course it's okay to have a cohort but it you know think about how you can have different mediums to make the most engaging content as possible and I like to think about how do you create maybe a 70% watch as you go or enjoy as you go and 30% live component Cameron Mena ask what specific questions do you ask your community when gaining insight for your products for example if I set up a type form right now what would the question would be on it so I'm a big fan of open-ended questions now why when you ask an open-ended question and what that means is it's not a yes or no answer it's basically a blank box that allows people to type in you know their desires their wants their needs and you just get a lot more colorful answers and you really really get to put yourself in the minds of your Target customer I'm a big fan of that open-ended question Christina Flynn asks I'd love to hear your perspective on how generative AI will intersect and have the most impact on community/ communities in the context of your ACP approach specifically bonus what's the most productive use case you found in AI in your daily work generative AI is going to have a massive impact on communities specifically around Q&A so when you have a community there's so much question and answers happening at all times and a lot of the same questions get asked so having just better community service I call it which is like a form of customer service through Q&A that's powered by generative AI is definitely where things are going the bigger trend is definitely that customer service in general is going to be powered by generative Ai and a lot of people think that well if it's going to be powered by robots it's going to be horrible truth is it's going to be a higher quality experience for the most part but of course you won't won't be able to replace humans 100% uh for example I'm doing this Q&A and hopefully won't get replaced and I think that you know humans do have a Gena a bit more of art where um a lot of generative AI are more about science I think uh you'll see major impacts on on the community space and internet communities thanks to generative Ai and what's been the most productive use case I've found for AI in my daily work honestly plugging in responses to emails through Greg GPT which is my GPT on top of chat GPT which speaks like me speaks in more of like a friendly conversational tone which is how I like to speak and uh yeah sometimes I just I want to you know I'll write and answer an email really quick post it into uh Greg GPT fixes all my typos it adds my tone and I could bang through emails significantly quicker I also sometimes ask it to uh just review like almost like a second opinion on something that's one of the benefits of Chad GPT or in my case Greg GPT let's just say you want to review the last 12 months of p&l and give your opinion on why business went down in December what is your analysis asking chat gbt for analysis especially when you're looking at the past always helpful and in general asking for second opinions definitely underrated way to use chat GPT haha Jawa asks how did you think up the names you probably need a robot and boring marketer can you just put any name or is there a framework for creating engaging names on Twitter um it is so important to have engaging names nowadays I have a notes file where I basically write any interesting words or phrases that I see and I just put it in my notes file on my phone I think that both those products you probably need a robot.com and boring marketing.com and our Twitter Persona boring marketer would be nowhere near as successful if it wasn't for those names they just stick the framework for coming up with a sticky name I don't know if there is one I think you do have to be able to recognize it if I were to come up with one off the top of my head does it make you laugh does it make you smile can it pass the telephone test meaning if you call a friend and you say go to boring marketing.com they know how to spell it that's really helpful but my biggest advice would be just to as you come across you know your daily activities to be writing down interesting words and phrases thinking about how you can remix them create your own versions really interesting names that are going to stick with people I don't know if I'm pronouncing this correctly but enigo Allegria asks what are your thoughts on offering Equity to creators have you ever thought about this and how could it work I'm thinking about it as an exchange for creators incentive alignment to promote my brand and FastTrack audience and Community Development um it's a great question more and more startups Founders are going to be looking to creators to find distribution it's a incredible source for distribution the problem is a lot of these startups are going to do deals with these creators they're going to give away 20% of their business and creators are busy people and they're basically going to might just forget about this or they might find another shiny object so I think that if you want a creator to partner up with your business and I think it's a fantastic idea think about how you can do Milestone unlocking for a particular Creator so if you hit a million dollar in Revenue you get 5% if you do this you get that is a great way to unlock the power of creators but at the same time protect you from having some Creator own a bunch of your business that isn't doing much Jacob asks what's the better way of getting people into a community magnet which a community magnet is is basically this lead magnet where instead of bringing them to a traditional lead magnet which might be a PDF or a book you're actually bringing them into a community so this person says should you go from YouTube video to a public school or do you go from a YouTube to a convertkit landing page and then to a private school so I love school as a way to host your community I use it for myself and and a bunch of our businesses I think one downside of school I will say is that you can't create landing pages on the Fly you can basically send people you know you let's say you're recording a video and you're like go to my school and you give them the link but you're not able to Prime them as well as you would on a landing page where you can control the messaging of course School gives you some ways to control the messaging but it isn't as dialed with a customized platform like convertkit so first of all I highly recommend school so sign up to school it's like $99 a month to sign up for it or if you sign up to our course Community Empire you actually get it for free so sign up and then and if you have the ability to create attention via YouTube Twitter Instagram whatever send these people a landing page where you can prime them tell them about your value proposition show them your brand get them immersed in it and then from there bring them to the school uh and then you get their email address and then you bring them into the community magnet and you nurture them to hopefully eventually sell them products so most of the schools that we work with they're free schools and then you can also create a paid school where you can basically say anyone who wants to join my paid Community it's going to be $99 a month $150 a month $10 a month but you can start with the audience build the community and then build that paid monthly subscription product Mike wi asks do you think it's wise to run ads to your free community absolutely I mean if you would run ads to a lead magnet why wouldn't you run ads to a community magnet so if you know how much a email is worth to you let's say it's worth $5 an email newsletter subscriber why wouldn't you pay $2 for it and then you're making that Arbitrage spread and the beauty about the community is you're going to be nurturing a good portion of those people within it so hopefully that actually increases the lifetime value of your customer Pete orstein asks how often should I post on LinkedIn in what format and any underrated hacks that I've discovered it's a great question LinkedIn is so underrated especially if you're posting on X posting on Twitter basically a very similar type of content that you can apply to LinkedIn you just have to take your content put it into stories that's what performs well on LinkedIn tell me about a story of something you've learned something that's happened to you you a failure and just post every 24 hours the algorithm favors 24 hours I think an underrated hack is if you create these cheat sheets people love them people save them so they do really well so that's it for this video I hope that some of your questions were answered and if you got some more leave them in the comments below and and I'll make sure to answer them in a future video thanks for watching [Music] bye

serious question how would you create a program to help us become less addicted to our phones I'd be curious to see the replies in order for us to be less addicted to our phones I think we have to be honest that the people who make the phones and people who make the apps are designing the apps for it to be as addictive as possible so it's up to us to refrain and limit our use of some of these apps a glass of wine a day is fine but having three glasses a day or five glasses a day is not fine so I think education is just a really big way for us to be less addicted to our phones I also think that making it easier to basically download a particular app that is literally designed for us to stop using the phone so I think there's going to be a whole new economy for different apps different Chrome extensions to get us to stop using our phones

if me or you were trying to make $10 million this year how would you do it your idea on pet supplements a pet ag1 I think is the single best business idea in the world right now my God I hadn't heard that but that is the single best business because I would buy it right now it's beautiful like if you build a news a paid newsletter that brings in a million dollars chances are your margins are 90 plus% MH yeah we have a paid you know we call it a membership that is like part paid newsletter part community and we charge $100 a month for it dude we had 20 signups in the last 24 hours it's wild I don't see anyone on substack doing this like even the biggest newsletters the missed opportunity is realizing that the recurring revenue is the beginning not the end something Dicky I've been talking about a lot too is that spending money is a skill and so I think part of that growth is confronting that discomfort where you have to get used to spending five grand a month then you got to get used to spending 10 grand a month then 20 grand a month you know and if you don't allow yourself to confront that you're never going to feel the feeling of spending more which allows you to then want to go out and make more which allows you to get to the next level you know spending money is a skill there's a lot of money on how to get rich but not a lot on how to be rich like the people who make a lot of money but have a horrible relationship I think is the worst case scenario because you just feel this overwhelming guilt all the time that you're making a lot but not spending it and and when you spend more you still have the same relationship with money that you had when you were making way less I think people brag about that it's like the rich person who drives a Honda but I look at that I'm like they just haven't kind of done the work of you have more security now why don't you invest in it yeah it's like having a scarcity mindset while you're surrounded by abundance I okay so we're live on the pods we're live I'll just tell everyone I'll announce to the world there's this apartment I really want yep goal apartment a goal apartment I I live in a two-bedroom pretty big apartment but I want to move into a four bedroom and for fun there there's this building next next to me that has this that has two apartments for sale one is they're giving it away they're giving it away I think it's one of the most expensive apartments in Miami and the other one is less that I looked at but still quite a bit okay and I thought it would be fun you know Saturday afternoon went with my wife to go check out the spot uhhuh I checked it out and we like didn't say anything to each other cuz we were speechless because like we walked out of there and we just like envisioned ourselves there I think everyone envisions themselves there the Jo I used to have this joke with with Alyssa we would go for walks around Beverly Hills in LA and we'd go on the walk and she'd be like I could really imagine us living here and I'm like oh yeah oh yeah you and every other person ever I approve of this one so in my mind I've been trying to decide is this and I'm curious your thoughts like am I buy am I buying this apartment or am I considering buying this apartment for like maybe it because it is the nicest building and there's some status and ego related to that or am I buying this apartment because I'm going to have a family one day and I want to like have the best possible environment for them and so just how do you think about when you're making purchases you know are you doing this out of ego at of status or are you doing it for well if if you couldn't tell anyone that you bought that apartment would you still buy it I mean yes right then I guess it's less ego yeah especially with Apartments you kind of want to be anonymous with what you bought I think M want Broad and be like this is my address look at how sick you know that's the lot like the last thing I want someone to do is to pull up my H like if someone pulls up your house it's like that person lives there that kind of looks cool until you realize that people can do that and then you have a family do I need do I like I live in a really sweet place right now it's like do I need and there's like another unit in my building that I could buy that's four bedrooms which is a third of the price price or quarter of the price it's like at what point is enough enough I think what does not matter is the ticket price on the house it's purely the monthly cash payment that you're going to outlay yeah yeah and if yeah I think a really good qualifier is if you buy it and that monthly payment causes you stress yeah is it worth it that's the thing that's that's the question because if you can do it and you're like that's a there go that's a marginal increase and it like doesn't really stress me out that much cuz if you go down the rabbit hole of do I really need this well does anyone like aside from basic human needs does anyone really need do you need to work as hard as you do do you need to you know so this is a really good segue with what I want to talk about and why I came down to perfect ship why we a nice natural lead in here live in Miami the shipyard um what up looking great the reason I came down is if me me or you were trying to make $10 million this year or just someone was trying to make trying to do how would you do it do you have any ideas different Trends you'd look at niches like I want to spend this time basically jamming on how we could make $10 million and that could be within your business or it could be just complet you know other ideas that you have yeah cuz that's the question building off of what you currently have or starting from cold zero nothing let's start with nothing nothing yeah like completely new business so I I filled out a couple on your thing your idea on pet supplements a a pet ag1 I think is the single best business idea in the world right now my God I hadn't heard that but that is the single best business because I would buy it right now it's beautiful it takes what ag1 has done which is an extremely high margin product that is a complex formula that you can't recreate there's no proof that it works or doesn't work so you're pretty much selling placebo Yep they're selling vegetables yeah like once you're on it you're going to say you feel better to justify the purchase that you made no one is taking ad1 and be like I don't feel any different it's like oh I spent a bunch of money on this I feel great and then they have such high margin that they can just have a army of Affiliates sending out the fact that they're taking it so it's a genius marketing funnel should we go build this cuz I love this idea if you did this for pets it's even better because there's even less proof that it works like what are you going to ask your pet if it's feeling better from it scen supplement no so what so what you're talking about is I went on my first million I I I pitched this idea from that pod one of the largest water manufacturers and water companies in the world reached out to me H and said if you can figure out what the formula is I'll put it in the water and we can like co-ack it together what sorry stupid question what does water have to do with it so it'll be waterbased so you need like the Water Production facility and stuff see okay got it you're basically selling pet water anyway also he has uh you know he's in every Whole Foods in in the world uh he's in you know every uh Publix every Safeway all these big grocery chains so if I did it with him I wouldn't have to do just D Toc I could also be in store interesting yeah so I think you know I I I'm definitely considering it you know but the you know I think the reason I'm what's the Counterpoint why wouldn't you I just digital products are easier to build Than Physical products um significant for sure easier but lower upside yeah I mean this has there are a lot of rich people who are going to put that on their credit card start feeding it to their dog and then never ever once look at it again that's right because the risk of stopping to give stopping giving your pet a supplement is higher risk than giving stopping yourself cuz like you could feel it but you won't see that your dog feels worse I don't know I like right when you said that cuz I think already the smartest niche in the world I think what we could talk about are niches that could build $10 million businesses pets certainly one of them because like plants are the new pets and pets are the new kids yeah I was going to say it's not even like the health it's the emotional m i I would seriously do anything I was I don't know why I had this thought last night but I was like if something happened to my dog and they were like we have to do a life-saving emergency and it's going to cost $100,000 and insurance doesn't cover it I'm pretty sure I would just rip that immediately and not even think about it I love my dog like more than anything else in the world except for my wife you know what I mean and so all a supplement is is like the reinforcement of I care about this part of my family totally you know I love you it's saying I love you without saying I love you dude and there's the marketing it's saying I love you every morning yeah say I love no I've been watching a lot of Mad Men I got Don Draper in my subconscious say I love you say I love you give them the gummy this little this little vegetable gummy I love you yeah bro whenever you you want to if you want we got time for a board meeting next week I'm ready to go like I heard that and just because I think pets I think another Niche that's interesting is just general paid newsletters in any Niche uhhuh where people are going to pay for a constant stream of information that they can't find elsewhere yeah so not news I don't like there are a lot of newsletters that have done well with just the free and sponsorship but I think the more Niche education that you can provide on a paid basis and but still Target the same niches like a hyper Niche pet paid newsletter of you have this specific type of dog and here's the ongoing upkeep of just you have a palski and that requires a completely different way of thinking and managing that dog and everything every palsky owner in the world would pay for that because it's so specific okay so cool like to validate that idea Royal Kanan the the dog food company their whole Innovation was we don't make we're not going to compete on like price or product packaging and just dog food in general literally all they did was just break out and say on this package this dog food is for Border Collies whereas this dog food is for golden retrievers and there's very little I mean they say that there is but come on like there's very little Mar you know marginal difference between the two so if you think about that through the lens of Education most people are like I'm going to write another Finance newsletter or I'm going to write another and they just pick the big broad category but if you think about it like hyper specific like I have a border collie mix I would subscribe to a paid newsletter on how to take care of my border collie because Border Collies have different Health needs than a golden retriever would for example and what do you think people would pay for something like that is that like a $10 mon 10 to 20 yeah 10 to 20 but then the thing is you have a recurring base of purchasers that are going to buy other things that you sell because they're paying you right now right yep that's what people don't talk about enough is that when when I bring up paid newsletters they're just like well just paid newsletters it's just like okay I have a, people paying me $10 a month or $20 a month and I'm like to start you do to start then you can layer on that's the first purchase not the last versus a lot of other companies that when you sell a one-off product it's the last thing and it aligns incentives for you to continue to deliver high quality information cuz you're going to lose that customer and then the ability to sell them more things right I like that little mix and Nuance of the newsletter being paid is they're continuing to pay you which forces you to put out good content otherwise it just all goes create better and better things like you're forced to improve if you want to write a paid newsletter what framework for new categories do you have like how what makes a good category versus an you know a not good category um we wrote up this little checklist we create so many things now I'm like struggling to remember the specifics but the the big one is like a it has to be a very tangible asset so a lot of people are like I'm going to start a paid newsletter and they think that they can write about whatever but something happens when they make it paid that's not really what's happening a paid newsletter the way to think about it is it's a book that never ends so it has to be a topic that you want to repeat infinitely the reader wants to consume infinitely and every issue has to feel like a tangible object so how do you make it tangible like R right with AI news letter every issue is here's a framework but then here's the chat GPT prompt so every time I give you a prompt it feels like I'm giving you a a box like an object you know so how do you make every issue a recipe or a you know some sort of like designed framework or a prompt or a checklist like it has to feel like a thing okay I have a uh a prompt for you so I have no idea where this is going do paid newsletters just become paid AI agents or paid AI characters like when I hear you talk about that I'm like okay what you're saying is basically you know you're right with AI newsletter I'm like okay so basically I'm going to subscribe to this and you're going to teach me basically how to become a more prolific writer in real time and I'm going to basically read your newsletter and then I'm probably going to open up chat GPT and then I'm going to read your newsletter I'm going to open up chat GPT is the future of education and paid newsletters more something like there's the Dicky and and Cole bot basically that's that you just like Ping and you're like hey today I want to learn about how to write copy for you know the pet Niche and then you kind of have this conversation yeah that's like that's what agents are trying to be now you know that's like the whole point of that in the store but I think it's really easy to jump to the conclusion that AI just replaces you and ai ai is good at executing instructions but it's not very good at creating net new things also my my whole take on is AI good at like completing tasks AI is basically an intern yeah a very uneducated it's an uneducated intern that is sloppy so if it's not doing what you want uncinated right your fault if it's not doing it I'll say that for the camera it's an uneducated uncinated intern Ai and like love them for that understand that that's what you're getting totally but they're a genius yeah that's a Thing If you program them right they can do everything but they're just like yeah literally what where my brain jumped with as we were talking about like the pet Niche and if you had a paid newsletter the real upside I think comes in the back end in how you can create as many different specific paid newsletters based on the same content so what you just said clicked in my head of Royal K9 is now marketing their pet food to different dog niches the only change they more than likely the only change they made is on the label with a very small mix of the product yeah so if you had some kind of Baseline newsletter with 500 different paid optins that you could easily create with AI so that that's where I think AI plays the biggest role is you say I need 500 different versions of this one thing here's how to create one version now go create 500 mhm right because imagine how many paid newsletter optin you could have for how to raise your blank pet like this kind of dog if you had 500 specific ones you'd have 500 more potential optins versus just here's how to raise your dog and that's that is the modern-day Agora like do you know Agora publishing say I do but for the okay it's it's like one of the craziest but like least well-known companies ever and their whole business model they were I know because you've told me about it most people don't know and they it's like a billion dollar company and their whole it's just a portfolio of paid newsletters bundled with different education products they they essentially created that model and where everyone's brain goes is oh okay a bunch of Niche newsletters like how lucrative can that be first first of all you're taking for granted recurring Revenue because recurring revenue is extremely valuable and extremely cushy you know and then second is Agora doesn't have like five paid newsletters they have like hundreds and hundreds and hundreds so what you just described is just the modern day version of that and you could build that with far fewer employees far fewer writers if you hit AI correctly well the other thing is so going going back to Agora and their model and why it's brilliant is and going back to how do you make 10 million doll in a year like if you build a news a paid newsletter that brings in a million dollars in Revenue like chances are your margins are 90 plus per. yeah and is it crazy that that business is worth 10 to 12 times profit I wouldn't say it's crazy it's not crazy you're you're within a five or 10x if you wanted to sell it yeah so but again like that's what's so and we have yeah we have this conversation all the time because it's like hey why would you sell it because the cash it's throwing off is amazing and essentially autopilot and B it's not just that asset it's that now you have all those people that you can sell other products to MH so why would you sell that the only reason you'd sell it is if you can't get a mortgage to buy this apartment so here's the thing though okay a couple interesting things on that right the idea that we're going to have paid newsletters as of right now that are 300K a year between right with a fiction writing and then write your way to wealth we want to build that to a million this year if someone came and offered us 10x on that I'd probably sell it at a million for 10 just I think that's only because of where we are because of relative to our but if you were higher up you wouldn't do that so it is a function but an interesting way to think about this and I've been chatting with him is like if you look at building a portfolio of Cashflow businesses and some of the ones that are more sustainable than the others like if you have three paid newsletters that all generate 300K a year because that's you know 5,000 people paying you 20 bucks a month that is so decentralized in terms of How likely that is to go to zero your risk it's extremely sustainable as long as you keep writing it cuz like say you hired a writer in the quality took a 10% hit and stopped giving it any attention the bleedout on that would still be years and years and years of that cash flow so if you can match some of your personal recurring expenses like that $28,000 like how if you could match your mortgage that's 30 grand to a paid newsletter with a th000 people paying you 30 bucks a month and that was you had almost pure confidence that that wasn't going anywhere over the next 10 years you'd buy the house of course I think right and that's why you know everyone should have a I think a paid newsletter or a paid Community to um which is Sim is similar like we have a we have a paid you know we call it a membership paid membership that is like part paid newsletter part community and we charge $100 a month for it and like dude we had 20 signups in the last 24 hours W it's like lifestyle cash flow matching is an interesting topic $2,000 a month okay but so to take this a step further because it's wild I don't see anyone on substack doing this like even the biggest newsletters the missed opportunity is realizing that the recurring revenue is the beginning not the end so what you what happens is you have all these creators that go I started a pay newsletter and then they reach success that you have paid newsletters on sub substack doing hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars a year and then they don't sell them anything else so immediately the whole equation looks different when you go and 10% of the people who are paying me on a monthly basis also bought the $20 ebook that I put together or also bought the $200 course I put together and I don't understand why more people don't and then to take that a step further right then you can take all your paid newsletters and at the end of the year you can bundle them into a book right so now there's another product like the way I would so the way I would do it and I'm curious your thoughts is I wouldn't start by adding like digital assets to start selling them I would think about what is the most like .1% experience I could offer to this group so for example like with Community Empire our paid membership and and email would you know maybe I do something like instead of $99 a month for $500 a month like you can have you know a a monthly dinner with someone from our team or like something for the DI hard fans like what's or dinner once a year you have dinner with me yeah you know as long as I think that experience is also an option but it's like what are you solving for and being careful about your time involvement what do you what do you want to commit to time this is what it's taken both of us a long time to start to internalize this but time is always the easiest thing to increase something in the short term tot like we know we're like oh if we give away our time we will increase revenue on literally anything this month right but then we're screwed like now we're out of hours now we can't do anything so a a a middle ground solution something that we do a lot is uh an experience bonus would be if you have a paid newsletter you have a thousand people on it and then you go once a quarter I'm going to do a live uh Workshop but it's paid so it's like 100 bucks 150 bucks hop on zoom and here's the topic here's what we're going to drill into that's an easy way of increasing the LTV but also giving an experience you can take the recording you can add the recording to your archive in the paid newsletter you have an asset the compounds like that's a nice little middle ground versus a lot of people are like buy my premium and I'll do an hour of coaching with you a month and then all of a sudden you're out of hours and you can't build anything else it's funny I see like a lot of solo preneurs do that and so like they tweet about oh I escaped my job and then it's like and I built this like bu J yeah I built this new job most making the exact same except I'm working twice as hard I'm still selling my time Sol preneurship is just a high Pang job which in the beginning is great awesome like if you're if you're brand new to making 10 grand a month that's what you should do totally but that's not going to get you to to 10 million yeah no I want to talk about 10 million during this you know I know I'm with the right people to talk about it with well there's only one way to get the apartment you got to you got to think bigger you got to think bigger okay so paid paid newsletters do you have any specific ideas besides anything in pets that you know if you weren't doing what you're doing now you you'd go after um I think if if we didn't have anything that we were doing right now but so say Dicky and I sold everything that we had right now and we were starting completely over I feel like because of our personal interests the next thing we would build would be like a how to think about Finance as a as a guy in your mid 20s to pre- 40 yeah cuz I think that specific window of person is and not to like exclude others but it's just that type of person has such unique challenges and questions and things at that phase of life I think we both would get I would start Ain I someone actually messaged us in our slack uh that my writing has been like my writing over the last month has been extremely personal to me for the most part it's like what am I learning what am I thinking about and I want to get back into doing that more and he asked if I was going to start a paid newsletter to talk about these topics cuz I don't want to go down that like as much as it's fun to talk on social about that I think there's something there's like a stigma to talk about dating or Finance or like to you just don't want people quote tweeting you when you talk about money on Twitter it's way better usually doesn't end well it like once that escapes to NPC Twitter it just becomes so toxic that you have to put some kind of pay wall before you talk about a lot of those things so I don't know why why do you say that cuz cuz people can't you can't talk about making millions of dollars like it's going to offend people the Aver especially on Twitter gets extremely offed at the idea that people have money so you have to put up some kind of pay wall luckily I don't think anyone listens to this podcast that that because if you're listening to this podcast like you're you're you have a bias for Action to do things and to to better yourself but yeah you're right I I have gotten things that have gone viral on Twitter and then I look to see like all these Anonymous accounts it's like completely it's not good for you because it it disincentivizes you to keep writing about it versus if you write a small $50 a month paid newsletter to a hyp specific group that engages with every single thing then there's no point to run on social about it you just have this group who's telling their friends if you can write a paid newsletter where you're only marketing is people forwarding it to a friend and saying hey you got to sign up for this that's a sweet spot yeah there and it's worth saying this happens at every level like if you're jamming with a small business owner that's doing you know 200k a year and you walk into the room and you're like you got to think bigger this is how get to 10 million a lot of them don't want to have that conversation they're like I like where I'm at and I don't need you know it's like threatening and then you go to a different room and it's people with $5 million businesses and someone's like hey you got to think bigger to get to 50 not everyone in that room is wants to have that conversation so that that friction happens at every level you know and so that's part of why it's so difficult to find people to talk about money with cuz like a lot of it comes down to what level are you at where do you want to go with it so you'd start with a a paid newsletter on that topic and then where do you think you would take it from there uh I mean I think of all the businesses that we've built in the past three years we've learned that the group coaching model is the fastest to scale mhm probably most profitable like probably doing another group coaching program would be lwh hanging fruit because you can get a group coaching program to to 510 million like if you have a good category you can do that and group coaching meaning like uh how often do you do it like what what does that look like well the way PGA for example is structured is it's like a one to many it's async curriculum plus we have team members that specialize in different things to answer questions so there's realtime support we'll do like a weekly Hot Seat that's live so there's an Asing component there's a live component there's a community component so you have all these different things working to either teach someone hold them accountable gamify the journey you know whatever it is um and you can do that in a lot more categories Than People realize the other thing I would do if I were you and I was building this is I would build a a SAS product along with it so for for for this audience like basically mint.com just recently shut down yeah yeah I saw that that was really surprising very surprising but it's it is and it isn't because it is because it was actually a great product that was was trying to do too many things for it was trying to do something for everyone where I think Niche personal finance is an interesting idea like we use co-pilot to manage our stuff co-pilot for X basically right exactly is is is the idea so co-pilot for the people who don't know is basically mint.com track your net worth track your credit cards track your personal stuff um but yeah you it it was it was everything in the kitchen sink it got to that point because it was B by into it MH um not surprisingly like they make QuickBooks you know obviously the QuickBooks people aren't going to make the like most beautiful streamlined products in in the world you know so copilot came in a couple two three years ago and it's just a simpler mobile first version and I heard they're killing it um they're probably doing co-pilot yeah it's only like six bucks a month I think it I use it I showed you my workflow for using itct beautiful it started off at I think a $1.99 a month and then if you 3x your prices and know and you're still growing definitely that that's a good sign yeah so is there an opportunity to build co-pilot for X um for different niches that's just kind of an interesting problem yeah I think that's the way to think about it you know like especially with all the new like no code tools AI tools I think you're going to get a lot of smart driven individual people just sitting at their laptop being like I built the co-pilot for pet owners of Border Coles yeah did you listen to the most recent Allin from this past weekend do you guys listen to Allin very very rely I think I listened to like half of it so uh freedberg had David freedberg worked at Google doing a bunch of stuff he had this really interesting idea of SAS being like this moment in time blip in terms of a viable business model between software that you had to download on your computer and then software that can be written by AI where now the ability for an individual to spin up a more specific version of all the oh sasses that are trying to do everything for everyone is only going to decrease right so if you have someone in house if the most productive Engineers can become 10 times more productive using AI code and they're able to build these products inh house that model goes away in an interesting like that's an interesting thread to pull on is how many SAS platforms Could you actually better tailor for your individual experience that aren't that difficult to build with co-pilot and other AI coding tools and so I actually just sent a newsletter this morning speaking to this the one thing that I speak to about in the newsletter is also the business model changes so the way SAS works today is you pay a monthly fee $66.99 a month and you get access to the software where I think things are going is it's going to be pay per task yeah the CHT or back to one time purchase I the base camp guys just launched their slack yeah slack killer or something like that and it's just you pay for it once like old school buy a CD put it in your computer that's basically where but the reason why I'm so fascinated with this is because of the the idea of LTV relative to just recurring Revenue because I feel like a lot of times people will create products that recur and they think if once someone signs up that recurring Revenue never goes away but really there's always some sort of Tipping Point you know so you're like okay my average churn I know net net m TV on an average customer is $215 you know so it's interesting to either have some of that data or sort of speculate what that data would be and go okay well if my average LTV is going to end up being around 200 why don't I just remove the recurring option and sell full access for 300 bucks and capture all that LTV up front and force a different purchasing decision totally or even if you have an idea for co-pilot for X you can build the landing page build the mockups and be like you know post on Twitter hey hey you can pre-sell it prell it like to fund your your development I think a lot of more people are going to do that so many different rabbit holes you could go down with that like if you have fewer Engineers working at every company but more solo Engineers building things yeah I want to talk quickly even though it's like off topic about uh a conversation I had with someone in M Miami the other day so he we went for coffee and he was telling me about uh a particular person on Twitter that showing these Mr Numbers for a particular business and I happen to know what the Mr was it a SAS it was a Services based business I happen to know the revenue of that and basically the monthly I I got the updates for that particular business and it was a person that was basically posting on Twitter and saying hey I get you know I got $10 million of Revenue 10 million ARR divided by 12 Mr and and he was like really upset about it because he's like I'm out here I'm trying I have you know almost a million dollars AR it took me eight years and I was like dude don't believe what you read like don't make a you shouldn't feel bad logging on to Twitter and seeing that because it's not even truthful H yeah most of it isn't it's not and most numbers are just like if I see another agency owner put that they have 50 million in business pipeline by taking people who fill out a form like how can you say that you have it's just type form that's like saying if I took every email subscriber I have and multiplied them if they bought all my products and said I have 100,000 email subscribers and they all pay me $100 so I have $10 million in email pipeline you know what this is like I I worked at an ad agency right out of college and we used to have this joke where you like ad agencies are so liberal with how they talk about things it's like walking into Walgreens and buying toilet paper and being like Walgreens is a client yeah it's like like that's literally what people are doing on Twitter they're like they're like ah you know Walgreens is a client it's like really it's like well yeah I mean their toilet paper's great yeah they're even worse Walgreens is a partner yeah i' i' I've partnered with uh yeah introducing nor America our new partnership yeah with Walgreens there's a lot of context stuff like people taking lifetime revenue and calling that the revenue of their business so they'll be like I've done you know 5 million bucks over the past 5 years and then you'll see them go on podcast being like how I built a five million business that's not a $5 million business that's a $1 million business that's been around for 5 years that's right and like all those little nuances it just makes It's just sad because then you're all the people that want to learn are looking at that and and it's literally like you're you're giving them a broken version of the game to start and then they walk in with all these unrealistic expectations that's not how any of these businesses operate and that's why I wanted to bring it up it's it's for the people listening who are embarking on the $10 million journey and might see things on the internet and people you know quote unquote sharing in public so they're taking it as the gospel we should set some standards that there's just a collective group of people who go around policing anyone who doesn't talk in monthly free cash flow that hits your bank account monthly net free cash flow post expenses is the only number that matters in your business period full stop and a story so what is 50 million in business pipeline like okay but we're actually doing 300K a month at 40% margin so it's 120k a month free cash flow uhhuh divide divided by three Partners at plus expenses which means I make 20 grand a month after tax really it should be personal monthly after tax free cash flow and then you could bubble that up to the business level yes and every time there should be like a like a Chrome extension that every time like every time you see $10 million it's like it's the Twitter Community notes it's like doing the math on this business it's more than likely that this business own takes $20,000 a month because that normalizes it for everyone what is the amount that hit your bank account after all expenses at the end of every month that's such if you didn't talk that you should just get like there should be all reply Bots be like this is the monthly free cash flow bot this number is [ __ ] like imagine that Twitter would be such a better place that that actually leads me to another idea related to this we should build that coffeezilla for Tech entrepreneurs yeah seriously like huge audience opportunity like people would share that like crazy MH and you can monetize that that's that's actually a great Niche YouTube channel so for people who don't know coffeezilla YouTuber probably three plus million subscribers and he exposes scams yeah um and it's just like a guy with he goes after cryp crypto most he's gone after crypto he's gone after like Jake Paul too or something with his yeah so you get these like well-known people and he he's like a journalist about it like he has Integrity I bet yeah and he he really uh does a great job so and people share that right because you know well number one people like to see other people fail let's be real well it's like the business world's TMZ you know totally that's a better way of describing it like there was a point Gawker do you remember Gawker oh yeah tell tell people what Gawker was for most people don't remember I mean it was like a a news publication but they would like do hit pieces and they would like go after people Ryan holiday wrote a whole book about The Gawker story going after and right I don't I don't know too much about Gawker to be honest it was basically like uh yeah it was like a gossip column for for business yeah they shot down after the lawsuit right they shot down because they went bankrupt well Peter teal I think oh yeah sued them if anything the the old like uh this whole Fiasco that happened with open Ai and how it was like the coolest thing to ever happen to anyone who worked in Silicon Valley cuz they got to talk about it it was like Keeping Up with the Kardashians for nerds in San Francisco like the most important thing and all they could they'd wake up and like check the news be like what's Sam doing now literally myself included I did that for 48 hours you know that was an interesting thought experiment I couldn't sleep I was just thinking about Sam Alman all night yeah I didn't like that I don't know that didn't interest me at all I was like that just seems weird cool like he's either going to work there or not work there yeah you know the okay the other one that gets me is the person who goes I made all this Revenue only working one hour a day and I'm like nobody does that you like or or also the joke of like the morning routine thing where it's like you look at all these entrepreneurs they're like I'm awake at 3:00 a.m. I've had a full protein breakfast and red light sauna and I've run 7 Miles by 4:30 a.m. you know and it's like you're looking at this and you're like maybe you've done that one time you know and then and just like the person who takes the pipeline and like rounds up they do it one time and they're like and in theory if I did do this every day that would be my morning routine and then they make people feel bad cuz they're not yeah it's it's like oh I I woke up and I was tired this morning like I was about to tweet this and I didn't but I had it like drafted I was like I woke up yesterday and I basically woke up I flooded myself with coffee I took a nice warm shower I woke up at 7:30 a.m. B I woke up at 7:30 a.m. flooded myself with like four coffees literally drowned myself in coffee took a coffee bath yeah and uh I took a warm long shower not like a cold bath just a warm long shower s it was warm I even I busted it even hot hot hot it's like steam everywhere can can I give you an upgrade you got to buy these uh shower Steamers do you have shower Steamers no is do I need one of those dude it's like a it's like a bath bomb for a shower really oh my gosh it feels like you're in a spa it's amazing you just unwrap it you throw it at the bottom the water comes down and smells like lavender amazing keep buying it do you know how expensive those are you get a bag of like 12 of them for like 40 bucks or something I'm like add it to your shower routine this is something I'm trying to do more though cuz right now here's the idea sorry okay what are they called steam shows shower steamers for your dog actually though or your dog you know they need a better bath yes they it's like a CBD to make them calmer in the bath you know cuz dogs get stressed out about it yeah right your dog hates the bath unless they have bath CBD bomb I would buy this right now and for cats right uh-huh and for geres yeah cats hate water right so if you want to like make it a l more it's like a dry cleaner no but honestly honestly that concept steam showers for the productive Tech entrepreneur so like the product the Andrew huberman type guy oh I mean think about okay how do they sell tea you go into the the tea aisle and it's just white label green tea but one of them says calm and one of them says energy and one of them says Focus right you're going to buy the one that says the word of the thing that you associate with so you could easily do that for any category or any Niche take the tech entrepreneur and do shower steamers for raising your first round and you're stressed out yeah right yeah huberman's drink is going to if if he started a drink that was like sparkling water theanine caffeine everything that he re everything that he recommends you take in the morning and it was just called like you and it's got nothing else and only marketed it to that specific type of person it would crush call it sunrise and say only people who wake up before the sun gets up drink this like done do this and stare at the sun yeah the dicky Bush I actually think we're seeing the anti- huberman effect right now so that was a bit of my tweet that I was going to right yesterday I was I was going to I was going to say like at the end of my here's what I did this morning I I today I felt like the anti-hu yeah what's the what's the oh in that you like don't have a morning optimize this is I put this in the notes of the doc is like esoteric Health Twitter is always two years ahead of like everyone else so they're they're already on that train of like anti-optimization now leaning more into like intuition and things like that but I don't know you know there's both sides there's always a trend and there's always an anti Trend and it feels like hberman has gotten so big that of course you're going to have people be like I don't want to do a cold punch I I like my hot showers I am sick of how many more people are in the sauna in cold plune since it got popular though yeah specific groups of people why you you like why does it why does it make you mad well I like to not talk to anyone the worst are the people who are in the sauna now just sparking up a goddamn podcast conversation it's like oh let's just start talking to everyone it drives the last thing I want to do that's why I say I'm unemployed when anyone asks what I do in the SAA well you shouldn't say you're unemployed cuz if you're employed I have nothing to offer you I have no conversation I got nothing for you buddy yeah I want to sit here in silence if I accountant that works yeah accountant is better if I met an unemployed person in the sauna I'm like I need at a luxury gym yeah I need I looking for who are you got nothing for you buddy that's like my go you're my you know you're mysterious you're wearing Lululemon you know I don't get it something isn't adding up that's true yeah yeah I hate I hate that but there's a specific typee of person that has started to do that that only comes to the gym now to like sauna and Cole plune MH and they're just getting their optimization routine in and not doing anything else I heard that's called a professional workout did you hear the executive workout no steam room in a weak R shot yeah I used to do that one in New York every once in a while a wheatgrass shot yeah Oh I thought you said a wheat grass shower shot the executive steam is Frid morning Friday morning on Wall Street that's a thing okay okay I want to I want to end off with uh got this note notes file of all these ideas I've got about 100 ideas in in there here amazing I'm going to give you a couple and you can tell me if it's you like them or you don't like them good reads someone needs to reinvent good reads yeah I hate that platform like it's it's such a great idea like a social network around books um essentially and reviews around books um what's it called a letter box was recently acquired by tiny and Andrew wilon M I can see and letter boxes for for films I can I could see like a letter box level in terms of design for good reads I feel like we're due for it they were acquired by Amazon I think many years ago I think a a good reads for podcasts or good reads for your Twitter feed would be interesting right what if you could integrate your Twitter feed with like your liked tweets all went somewhere and then you could see and talk to or connect with other people who also like those same tweets or listen to those same podcasts that could be kind of cool yeah that's interesting it I mean all this sort of just speaks to the broader Trend which is there's just way too much content like we just can't consume all of it so you're probably going to see same with that niching down idea more and more platforms that are like here's how to parse just the feed on Twitter versus here's how to parse just the podcast you listen to on Spotify versus just the videos you watch on YouTube you know just too much too much so what do you think what do you rate that that idea on um no sevens no sevens I would use it I'd use it more I don't like good reads yeah I never really used good reads I don't know I know people who use it to count the number of books they read that's it like they add the books that they read to it but I don't know I wouldn't be excited to work on it but I would use it I I feel like a cooler there you go there there's my summ that's a good answer hly I feel like a cooler feature is uh isn't in Amazon Kindle like and I don't I don't use it but I just know of it where you can see how many other people have highlighted the same sections like that to me is a lot cooler um but that's how you can start that's how I would start off good reads 2.0 would be probably that I think readwise is probably trending in that direction some kind of consolidation of all the highlights yeah true cool can I can I give you one of my business ideas yeah all right so one of mine is I think that the next Simon and Schuster or penguin random house or whatever is going to be one individual that builds I mean one author but has like a whole team so the an author is being treated like a venture back startup and the team and that author train an entire model on how that specific author outlines a certain type of story how they write it vocabulary choices like really really in-depth and then it allows that author and that style to you then have the ability to create a book a week or a book a day and you can just flood an entire subcategory imagine James Patterson could actually do this right now James Patterson's like I want to write Thrillers he already writes co-writes with other people he's doing the manual version of it with another author he does a book a month okay well if he took the time and built a model he could write a James Patterson level book a day yeah and I that's going to happen it's just a question of who goes and builds it how long does it take and you have to have enough of a library to train the model on you cuz the problem you see it with now like open AI that was the whole issue is like you can't go train your model on other people's content without those other people going hey what the hell that's right so the solution is you have to have produced enough volume to train the the model on you and you're the copyright owner and the problem and why James Patterson can't do this is because his publisher owns all his stuff so now there's a conf so is a publisher going to build it is he allowed to build it you know but I'm really fascinated by the idea of what does it look like for an author to create a book a day and have it actually be 80 90% quality of what you would produce on your own yeah I mean the average author does what a book every three years two three years yeah if that five years I think it's an it's interesting and he he was the one who broke that model and went I want to do I there were a couple authors before him but he was really the one that went I want to do two or three or four books a year and then now as far as I know he's one of the only authors that cranks out consistently a book a month every month year after year after year he's doing the manual version because he's working with other writers yeah my guess is this also translates pretty well to music oh same thing's going to happen same thing yeah yeah I like this idea it's probably like an 87 87 for you you said no sevens oh 8.7 okay cool I'll take it that's fine you got any good ones siki it's not something I actually do much it like brainstorm random business like I don't have that note I was how my brain work see I was I wrote something the other day that I love to learn but I'm not curious at all where I don't go down internet rabbit holes about random things and I felt guilty for that for a long time like random ideas and going down and spending like 10 hours on YouTube I don't like to do I don't know I think one of us needs to have that trade yeah I'm like what am I doing right now and what's the next logical step I I don't know I felt guilty but now I'm kind of leaning into it as a superpower no it's it's great in the opposite way you know cuz I just don't care about how the world Works people are like I'm fascinated by how the world works I'm like I just care that it works I don't really care at all about how right uh last idea before we before we I love that about you one of us has to so I'm uh looking to buy some art and I got a great I got an artist that you should buy okay he's on the up and up and I think I think you could tick The Tick the okay we we'll talk about that I'll put you on to him yeah there doesn't seem to be a good Marketplace for secondhand curated art isn't that what Master works or Master something in what way what do you mean by that so there's places where I can buy art that other people have owned before of course there's artsy which is like the big platform do you guys know artsy M it's basically like the Amazon for or art but they have like pieces in the tens of millions or millions of dollars to pieces that are $100 and some of them are like new pieces and some of them are someone else you know used so to speak I think there's probably an opportunity to do a marketplace with curated pie pieces meaning it's not as overloaded with like here's 1 million pieces here's maybe a subset um and also the ability to rent pieces I was actually just thinking that like a Airbnb I want to rent your Picasso for the weekend because I'm throwing a party yeah it' be kind of cool there's a huge level of risk in that obviously but renting pieces is seems interesting it also is like genz and Millennials our attention span is a lot less so it's like yeah I might enjoy this Picasso for a weekend but I don't know I hate it now I think about that a lot with like the hedonic adaptation of nice things like renting a nice car you can get 90% of the benefit and then then you like if you rent a really nice car for 3 Days on the fourth day you start to pick out things about the car that you don't like and that's like when you should give it up because then when you own it fulltime you're like damn like I went to Germany and rented a Porsche to drive on the Autobon and it was sick the first two days and I remember returning it on the third day being like [ __ ] kind of cramped in here like and I remember I was like that's a perfect time to get rid of that thing because the second you have any kind of complaint I think the same thing goes for like apartments or I don't know Apartments might be different but cars or art or things like that how can you get 90% of the upside with just the initial access and then not make it into something that owns you in the long term it's a good point and maybe this is a narrative I put I'm putting in my head but after this conversation I feel like apartments and homes doesn't fit in that category of you you know you don't I don't think you get used to a beautiful home like I feel like or do you I don't know like you you definitely do you definitely do so then why would I buy this apartment be I so my argument though is because it is the place where you most likely spend the majority of your time and so it's sort of like your bed like of all the things to max out you should probably max out the thing that you spend six seven eight hours a night in every night for your whole life you know and your home I think is very similar you spend especially now that we all work from home and like what why would you not want to optimize that whereas a car it's like and and I think it all comes back to it what's the pressure it puts on you relative to the enjoyment or the you know I think the solution is have someone that prevents you from thinking about the house in a negative way at any time which is basically if [ __ ] stops working you actually don't even realize it someone is there to repair there's like an on call right because otherwise you're just like bitching about your $30 million house and what sucks about it and that's just a place you want to avoid you don't want to be there which will happen cuz like your toilet's going to break and that's going to be annoying [ __ ] house you know yeah dude this has been so that was pretty solid this is solid proud of us we got some good juice going this is I like this it's all it's all because of the shipyard it's all so thank you for for inviting me here and and allowing this we should do this more we this a standing thing I would love that I think the first of many I would love that um where could my audience go and find out more about what you get they'll find us find us on Twitter Dicky Bush or Nicholas Cole 77 yeah start rting online.com they they'll find us they'll find us yeah I have this a heuristic that I've kind of been using is if with all of the things that we create if you can't find your way to the thing that's a little bit of a signal like yeah but we there's also the counter point we create so many things that like where should you go that's true but yeah okay that's that's fair but also just like just Google it you know totally I had this I had this happen the other day uh we had we hiring like a product designer and I posted about it and I had said go apply it on the on the website so some someone some guy reached out to me and he was like Hey like I can find like the job the job like the career section on on the late checkout website I hate to bring it to you but that's a signal that's a signal I and it's like I'm I had to respond I was like Hey like the best little hack I found for that is when we're interviewing someone ask them to send you the calendar invite for the time you send them and just like see that they can [ __ ] check a box of schedule it at the right time add a zoom link XYZ it's like the first little micro test of their General competence yeah another one that gets me is like we'll tweet something and then we'll append it and go and by the way if you want to start writing check out ship30 with a link to ship 30.com and then someone will comment and say what's ship 30 if you click the link the entire site will tell you what it is you know and like that it's such a small or sorry one more cuz I've been doing all these interviews for a new hire we're making another one is you send a cal invite and then I'll send the person an email and say great chat with you then let's use the zoom Link in the description I can't tell you how many people go sit in the Google meet link and that to me it's such a small thing but I'm like that shows me just that small level of detail that you're not you know that's the clip you're fired I find you in the Google meet it just got a there's someone waiting in there be like sorry you failed the first step of this job application please don't apply again no seriously there's there's this sorry real real quick just there's this have you seen the bear I got to say have you seen the bear no oh my God amazing show okay but there's this scene where they're hiring like a mat D and they're doing the interview and the girl is like oh she was great I think we should hire her and the guy is like there's no way we're hiring that person she's like why the interview went so well and he points to one of the place settings and he had like turned it so there were three the right way and one was wrong and he was like she just sat here the entire time and did a 45-minute interview and didn't fix that place setting that would have driven me nuts no attention to detail we're not hiring that person and like that it's the zo it's the zoom thing it's like you know or someone emails me they put a h in my name I'm like immediately I'm like you don't have attention to detail mhm it's not that hard totally my name's not Craig it's Greg yeah I saw a new one for you Nicholas Cole k l like Cole's the shopping thing I was like I've seen a lot of names for you I've never seen Nicholas Cole like the store so this would be a good time to announce I am part of the Kohl's Empire knew it that's actually the shipyard was actually funded by the Kohl's Empire oh man yeah so attention to detail everyone yeah that's that'll get you to 10 million thanks everyone all right y'all later boom

what is the best social media platform to start writing in today this is a great question but I think the way to think about that is what is your goal with your handle what is your goal with building an audience where does your audience live like what's an app that you love the best like what's an app that you're going to come back to so that you can consistently create content you know for me I actually find video to be really difficult but I find writing to be a lot simpler so if I would have started on YouTube that probably wouldn't have worked because I wouldn't have my 10,000 hours and continually showed up every single day and every single week ask yourself where is your audience and where are you going to consistently show up to

if your community asks you answer I've noticed you've got questions and some of them were so good that I thought it was worth answering them in a video so here is my first ask me anything where I'll be answering some of the most interesting questions that my community have asked me on my socials stick with me until the end because maybe your question will be answered too so the concept of making someone's life easier is the backbone of an impactful solution it's the humancentric appr approach that we Embrace in product design has there ever been a time when this advice significantly influenced one of my business decisions and the answer is absolutely I mean when you're thinking about developing products you're developing products because people have problems just replace the word product with Solution that's really what it is so it's always about how do you basically be a good host how do you make it easier for people the simplest products win and the products that really make people's lives easier are the ones that uh people remember and when they're thinking about a particular brand uh you'll come top of mine because they want that itch to be scratched next question I tend to agree with your take on short video being the way forward from there you can transition to newsletters subscriptions links to blogs in fact I believe short form video will be the new blogs can blogging really survive without videos redirecting traffic to them now that SEO is becoming sort of irrelevant due to people using llms people have been saying email has going to been is going to die forever and it's the same thing with SEO people have been saying SEO is going to die SEO is going to die I remember when social came out YouTube Facebook those platforms and everyone said well if people are going to be searching on YouTube and if people are going to be searching on Facebook they're not going to go to Google and the reality of the situation is yes llms are going to take some market share away from Google um I noticed in my own behaviors but it isn't going to be irrelevant it's just going to change and I expect that Google I mean you're seeing it with Bard you're going to have more AI results within the Google search results so I don't think blogs are going to die I think blogs if anything are going to thrive in this period if you actually look at Google Google's actually been prioritizing ugc content because if you think about it in a world where AI is creating 99% of the content if you have human created blogs with unique points of view then uh you know that will be prioritized so don't give up on SEO uh we actually have a business that uses AI tools uh to actually help companies with SEO and we're seeing some incredible results that's called boring marketing.com uh you might want to check that out here's the question I have no idea what to get loud about on the internet I've always found to be what hold me back with creating an audience and eventually an audience but I'm all for Building Products any tips basically this question is asking I want to get loud on the internet I want to make noise but I'm not sure why what to make noise about that's why I love tools that basically search and scour uh places for underserved niches so that's why you know I spent a lot of time talking about Reddit uh Reddit is a culmination of hundreds of thousands of communities and micro communities and you can see the growth rates and different trajectories of some of these communities and you could see that here's where some opportunity is and and this is where other opportunity is I think also it's just about you know we all have our personal interests and instead of just exploring your personal interests in sort of a solo way how can you explore it in more of an Internet way where you're sharing your journey exploring your interest so for example you know maybe I want to learn how to play Blues guitar and I'm a beginner what if I actually live streamed it every day and allowed people to follow my journey and i' probably attract the blues community so there's a lot of benefits with being loud on the internet and that's why I like to be loud on the internet next question what cities have I been spending my time in so I actually split my time the majority of my time is in Miami Florida maybe 8 months a year and then I spend a few months a year 3 months a year in a small town in Quebec I love both but for different reasons I've got the beach here in Miami and I've got this you know Mountain small town where I can really connect with my roots in Quebec serious question how would you create a program to help us become less addicted to our phones i''d be curious to see the replies in order for us to be less addicted to our phones I think we have to be honest that the people who make the phones and people who make the apps are designing the apps for it to be as addictive as possible so it's up to us to refrain and limit our use of some of these apps a glass of wine a day is is fine but having three glasses a day or five glasses a day is not fine so I think education is just a really big way for us to be less addicted to our phones I also think that making it easier to basically download a particular app that is literally designed for us to stop using the phone so I think there's going to be a whole new economy for different apps different Chrome extensions to get us to stop using our phones and I actually think that there was was a point where using your phone was high status and I actually think we're moving to using your phone out in public and stuff like that has now become low status and it's going to continue to be lower and lower status and I think that hopefully will get people to be more living in the moment to summarize I think that piece is there's a cultural Zeitgeist that's happening where I think we are all starting to realize that we should probably be on our phones less quick question why school and not Circle why did I build on school and Circle uh why is community Empire on school and the short answer is it's built by this guy named Sam ens who comes from the internet marketing world and really really cares about retention and engagement so for example when you create a post as an admin on school you can actually create the post and send that post as an email to all the people in your community that's really big for retention there's also uh leaderboard and a gamification of the whole Community experience so the way School works is you can set up different levels and the more you engage with the community the more you can unlock certain content that helps with engagement so I think the reason why 95% of communities are zombies is because they don't really nail engagement and retention and school to me is the best platform to go and nail those problems next question what is the best social media platform to start writing in today you know this is a great question but I think the the way to think about that is like what is your goal with your handle what is your goal with building an audience where does your audience live like what's an app that you love the best like what's an app that you're going to come back to so that you can consistently create content you know for me I actually find video to be really difficult but I find writing to be uh a lot simpler cuz I'm a writer and I've always l loved English growing up and and writing and creative stories and all that stuff video to me feels awkward so if I would have started on YouTube that probably wouldn't have worked because I wouldn't have done my 10,000 hours and continually showed up every single day and every single week ask yourself where is your audience and where are you going to consistently show up to um because consistency really outperforms anything else so that's it for today's video I hope you found it useful if you've got question questions leave them in the comments below and I'll make sure to answer them in a future video and of course if you don't want to wait for a future video you can join my free 5-day course at community empire.co and at the end there'll be a link to my private Community where you can answer me all the questions you want thanks for watching bye all

Title: THIS Is What Really Matters In Business
Published: 2024-01-12 13:00:45 UTC
Description:
”Nobody cares, work harder” might sound harsh, but it’s still very powerful advice. 

Missed revenue targets, losing a member of the team, a big client ending their contract — these all might seem like valid reasons to throw in the towel. 

But when we step back and look at the bigger picture, daily challenges become just that — a part of the journey.

So work harder or smarter, but keep going and deliver results. After all, resilience is what will set you up for success, both in business and life.

at the end of the day when I look at my bank account or our business bank account or the client who just left or the person who just left it doesn't matter there are things that are definitely valid reasons to pull back from something I can come up with all the excuses I want but at the end of the day it doesn't matter what matters is what happens and that doesn't always mean work harder it could mean work smarter but it just means results actually matter

so I I've always wanted to build a holding company for productivity apps and I understand that productivity apps the propensity to pay is very low I could give you all the reasons not to do it but I just like productivity apps and a lot of those apps have also just kind of been dormant and they're probably making millions of dollars you got to think about like what works on YouTube it's always like lifestyle Health Fitness making money and productivity and I think from Like A playbook standpoint making sure that either you're the content creator or there a content creator you can partner with for distribution and then if it's digital businesses is having some natural knack for product because that's going to be where a lot of the value ad is going to be Mike is back on the show you're one of my favorite people and you uh you brought some ideas on this doc so we're going to go through it and I'm just reading through this and it's just it's getting me stoked um you brought some heat I appreciate it so let's start with this viral tweet that you had yeah let's do it I thought I thought it'd be fun you know it's it's the new year and your last newsletter was on Trends or anti-trends so thought it would be fun to just throw some of those out there I was I've been thinking through a few just kind of Riff on them so I wrote this tweet about a month ago and I wrote it on a whim so I I I took most of the Year Off from Twitter and around near November December I was like maybe I should open up the app and you know just see what's going on and this idea that I was kind of percolating was around living your friends and I wrote in on a whim I was you know I was going to delete it after a minute because it didn't get any likes and I was like you know what let's just leave it up and then I came back a few hours later I was like whoa and the Tweet reads I noticed a trend where friends are moving next to each other it can be the same apartment floor neighborhood block or 100 acre rural area dividing into Lots weekly dinners and impromptu walks are more of the norm we used to prioritized finding the perfect house but now we're prioritizing being close to her friends and curating her own community and I think the reason it took off from reading all the comments obviously I got trolled any anytime anything goes viral I think the counterintuitive idea in there is that most people as they get older when they start having a family they move near their family and this is kind of like a a counter Trend to that which is moving as close as possible to your friends so I started to see this happening in Austin San Francisco even where I live so that was pretty interesting so Adam Newman we Works bankrupt and yeah yeah and Adam Newman of course raised $300 million to go build a business called Flo and they're opening their first building I think in Fort Lauderdale around here soon and it's basically the same concept as we work like this idea around like communal space you get like free coffee like amenities like that but around uh residential living also he's no longer doing long-term leases he's buying the buildings got it obviously he's learned from his mistakes um and we actually had at wew work we had a version of this um it was called we live and there was about four or five different buildings where people would come in and you'd pay rent let's say it was $4,000 a month this is in New York City um $4,000 a month and you got access to like a bunch of community activities you get access to a co-working space you got you know within the building you got access to food like you know and it was this it was it's it was this sort of product for like 20 something people moving to a new city where they had like a community in it what do you think of that idea where do you think that will go I think that's I think that's a little different because it's a company curating the community for you and I think what's happening now is people are be are being a lot more intentional so I was chatting with my friend safan and he said in San Francisco his group of friends are literally taking over a whole floor in in an apartment building so as soon as like an apartment frees up they they hop on it and they have like a whole list a waiting list of people that are trying to move in and it's about curating your own Community versus having other people curate it for you so I think that's what's happening um or it could be something as small as you know like splitting a a town Brooklyn town home where you live on the bottom floor and your best friend lives on the top floor and something nice about the impromptu going for a walk or just running to each other um you know when you have kids if you need to run somewhere they can watch your kids for an hour just having that Prime you know what community like literally pre- internet or hundred centuries ago what it was kind of like and I think there's a whole trend of people moving towards it and I saw I start seeing different variations of this right so there's weekly dinners so people just host weekly dinners which is kind of straightforward and then the the easier version next to that is live next door to your best friend like literally you you pick a neighborhood together you just do it you become roommates or you live next to each other and then there's like taking over a floor which is a little bit more organized and then I'm starting to seeing people like building a village where you know they take over neighborhood they take a house and they make that into the communal space kind of similar to we live has like a community garden a spa you know like a you know um they have meetings they vote you know there's dues so it becomes more organized they vote on who comes in and who's out so there's different levels and I'm starting to see that happening more and more and I find that pretty interesting so I agree with this trend I think it's happening and it's only going to get bigger and bigger if you're you know listening to this and you want to start a business based on this trend what sort of how do you how do you how do you build something in this space H that's a good question I mean I thought about approaching it less as a startup or business but running a neighborhood Village as a business right so I thought it' be F fun to play it as like a mini developer right so rather than building these track homes of cookie cutter you kind of go in and you take over a block and you you become really intentional about it um and I thought that would be fun but it would require a lot of work you would have to be super passionate about it and you would have to have a huge group of friends that would want to do it and Etc and but that's I feel like a more natural way to do it I feel like if it turns into a business kind of like a we live it becomes a little forced and then appeals to like the 20s something year olds and um but if I were to start a business I would run it kind of like a nonprofit type of vibe where you know I would be super intentional would have all the cool things that I would curate I would have like-minded people in that community and I don't know sounds kind of idealistic but you walking down the street you bump into your friends and their friends and you have these weekly dinners and things along those lines but I do value privacy too so I wouldn't personally do it but I would probably opt for weekly monthly dinner and live next to my best friend versus The Village but that could be a cool business like SL you know side hustle like project for for most people if they wanted to to to approach that I was with a well-known entrepreneur a few weeks ago and he shockingly it the first time I I had met him he's a tech entrepreneur yeah and I was like what's interesting you these days and he said Real Estate I was shocked I was shocked I was like what's his reason it's like what he so he's just like cash flow he's like 2024 year of cash flow um so I think he he's raised a lot of money building Venture back stuff and he's just like a bit jaded a little bit of it and he's he recently got married and and he's having kids and so I think he he got really into real estate so he asked me he said if you were to start a real estate business um what what would you do and I was off the top of my head and this is what I told him I said said cuz we're in Miami I said there's this thing called the bright line the bright line is this highspeed train that just came out here and what that does is it opens up a bunch of like you can get from Miami to Orlando in like three hours where you can get from you know my my place to Palm Beach in like 50 minutes yeah and there's probably an opportunity to build a new town oh love that idea yeah and my thesis is there's only one like cool this is can get me in trouble but there's only one real cool city in Florida and it's [Laughter] Miami so I'm sorry but you know I I would actually argue there are zero cool cities in Florida there's between zero and one Co in Florida exactly so I think that There's an opportunity to build like an art sort of inspired creative town you know that isn't that's kind of like Marfa Texas oh I think I think that is a great idea you think about the ultimate business is is taxes you know like tax citizens and then funnel that into some cool infrastructure that you would build ex I think I read that it's not I mean I might be wrong about this we should hit up chat GPT to ask this but I don't think it's that difficult to start a town in the middle of nowhere I think you just need a small critical mass of a few hundred people and boom you can literally create a town exactly and for those for those of you don't know Mara uh Marfa Texas I've never been there but basically they've got this really cool prod store in the middle of nowhere have you been there I haven't but I've seen a lot of people visit it and it just seem so Random to me why this town in Texas is a huge art destination yeah it's an art destination and a lot of people or people are trying to move there and um I think there's an opportunity like you you know he was like so so this founder is like so how would you actually do it and I was like well the first thing is I would start by building the community online so I would create content around it and there would have to be like some you know Museum or some like Prest store in the middle of nowhere like some art piece that like would attract this group of people but the beauty is you don't need to start a town and spend millions of dollars on the town initially you can just use the internet to build demand uh initially yeah I like that idea and then you can attract like-minded people that share the same values or principles and then you can kind of search for where this destination is going to be I would imagine most people would probably either live there or co-own a vacation home there right exactly that's the other benefit of it being in Florida is like you know northeasterners love coming down here during the winter yeah so if you can sell them culture plus a curated Community plus you know vitamin D you're looking good yeah that's like just a traditional commercial real estate developer in in a way it kind of reminds me of Windwood walls where that was all created I think I read on the wall there by a developer that wanted to revitalize that neighborhood and bring art and culture into it and that's right yeah so you can kind of I would imagine if you own hundreds or thousands of Acres of the mil I I don't even know if that exists in Florida but yeah you can make anything into a destination that people would travel to and yeah own all the land and start selling that off and if you wanted to really be ambitious you could you know turn it into a real town with with a government and mayor and city council members and whatnot yeah I think uh it's like a startup right like you don't know where it could really go but I think the beauty is and and bology talks about this too right he calls it the network State yeah um I haven't read the book but the concept around it is similar where you you know you do attract you can attract people online you bring them to a place um and it it could grow from there I think this is a great idea somebody should totally I I bet you someone's already doing this somewhere I don't know I don't I honestly don't know I don't know and I think the other thing that I like about this idea like the why now of it is the bright line has just opened up so oh for Florida yeah for Florida specifically well also the loneliness P epidemic or P you know where that's that's turning into a big a bigger and bigger thing where people are becoming more and lonely and they're craving these IRL interactions um so I think that's probably another why now which is people are getting addicted to their phones they're not they're lonely and they're looking for a community either friends or people that are like-minded yeah you know I think what you're seeing with what safon is seeing in San Francisco where all their friends are grabbing a floor and this you know that's a trend but also this trend around like um I want to feel more connected yeah to you know the city I live in the you know the community I live in I think you're going to see like my prediction is you're going to see a lot of new towns and new Cultural Center centers being created over the next 10 years oh I think that would be sick I would totally buy real estate there I mean look at look at what happened with um Summit Series like the story of Summit Series that's a great one started you know they didn't they buy like a ski resort and then sold off off each lot for whatever a million bucks yeah so the story there was it started off as they used to throw these events with like well-known people and they were like young 20s somethings at the time they'd like cold call Richard Branson and all these people and and somehow convinc some of them to come and join them in uh Park City Utah for these events and then they that they outgrew that and then they got a cruise ship and they invited people um and then eventually they were like let's get into the real estate business cuz the founders mom I think ran bisn now started bisn now media which was a network of Real Estate websites and from that they decided to buy I think it was like 40 or $50 million they bought a mountain Powder Mountain in Utah and they sold uh plots of land yeah there's something so simple about this business right it's just real estate and Community it's yeah kind of like the oldest playbook for business so t Circle back Tain question if someone wanted to do side hustle project they could do a smaller version of this within their own Community but if they want to tackle it as a business it's like the old tried and true tested business model that has existed since since the beginning of time which is developing land so but within that I think the other counter Trend was what you were saying around a lot of entrepreneur are kind of burned out from the startup cycle and moving towards new types of businesses so I'm starting to seeing that happen um as well so what what are your thoughts on that I mean what do you what type of businesses are you seeing well like real estate is a great example but um I think what will happen is the thought that comes to mind for me is that a lot of new fun funding mechanisms are going to start popping up and I think we'll start seeing the oneand done round and I think I think we'll start seeing dividend issuing start you know startups that pay dividend because not every company is going to break out so I think we'll start seeing a lot of people taking swings and if it doesn't really if it takes off for whatever reason they they can go to the chur around if it doesn't they could go the the alternative route so I think that will be an alternative path that I think a lot more Founders will kind of embark on especially as they hear stories from you know found entrepreneurs that are kind of trying something different that have done that path but and I think with the ra rise of AI and hard tech I think a lot of funding will go towards really hard tech problems and then there'll be this kind of like middle zone for everything else yeah so the dividends thing is real I think startups plus dividends like never you know that was then that was like oil and water right so that didn't exist and you know in the vocabulary of a startup uh up until you know you know who's really doing a good job at professing this is sahill from gumroad yeah that's where I first read about it I thought it was brilliant yeah so what's his do you know his startup that he has let's see in the dividend space gumroad no he has uh he's involved in flexile that's what it is flexi.com scale your business without full-time commitments I'm on the website right now so it's kind of it's not just dividends but basically flexile lets you on board and pay qualified contractors to help grow your business but it allows you to offer dividends as a part of that yeah like you said cash flow I think 2024 and Beyond is going to be cash is going to be what people want yeah so I think there's a ton of opportunity so okay so let's look at that so that's the trend right dividends is the trend cash flow is the trend for startups you know you could go and build a startup that does really well and offers dividends or you can do pixon pix and shovels for the space like sth Hill's doing yeah I think there'll be a lot of startups that are probably in the 100K to10 million Revenue range that where this would work really well for them you know like maybe they hit a ceiling maybe they can't grow maybe the founders are tired and they want to move on so I could see a lot of Acquisitions um a lot of I think 2023 was boring businesses was kind of like the thing with boomers are to be retiring so they need to transfer their businesses to the younger generation and if you Tech enable it you know you can make a lot of money doing that and rolling them up and I think that will work that will start happening and I think 2024 will be digital businesses so SAS content software apps I think that range between 100K and 10 million in Revenue I think it's going to be a huge AC like huge m&a activity I think we'll we'll see a lot more of that in 2024 yeah my take on the boring businesses like uh laundromats and um Self Storage is yeah the idea of the cash flow of those businesses are great but like the actual running of those businesses is not so great yes and I think a lot of people have learned that in in this year or last year yeah yeah so just in terms of like if I were to start a digital business versus a sweaty business let's say a boring business like from a from a time commitment and from a lever leverage and scale perspective much prefer digital business um and so I think what you're going to start to see is like I mean I guess the price for an acquisition might go up on the small scale right on places like acquire. comom yeah I think we'll start seeing that I think we'll start seeing some new financing that'll go into it a lot of activity I mean prices will probably go up I think we'll start seeing Founders going back in and buying companies because they realize how hard it is to go from Z to one and how much luck and timing factor into it but I think we'll just start seeing a lot more activity I think we'll start seeing um you know not just within those businesses but startups that are kind of failing merging with other startups that are failing to to survive I think we'll just see a lot of m&a activity and not and it won't be big tech company buying small startup it will be a lot of smaller businesses selling or merging together I think we'll just see a lot more activity there so you know what what ideas do you have if you were going to start one of these digital businesses in 2024 okay what would I'll throw this out there yeah so if I I've always wanted to build like a holding company for productivity apps and I understand that productivity apps the the the propensity pay is very low you know I could give you all the reasons not to do it but I just like productivity apps so you know how Microsoft Office has one subscription and you can access all their tools yeah I kind of want to do that for productivity app so I would go off and buy I would start rolling up like a habits app or a journaling app and then you just have this whole portfolio of apps and charge one subscription so hopefully the turn would be low because you get access to all the apps in the ecosystem but I think you could do this for any vertical and I think if you think about productivity apps when I look at them like oh I could build that but then I started thinking oh man going from 0o to one to like break out and get all the reviews and I like that's G to take forever so you know I think they're just something fun about going and buying buying up a lot of these apps and a lot of those apps have also just kind of been dormant you know they get updated once or twice you know a few times a year and they're probably making millions of dollars so that's one idea that I kind of pursued another one was wait on that so just on that like literally a few minutes ago I got a Tweet someone replied to me saying how in my newsletter my end of 2023 newsletter I recommended an app called clack it's like a paid app it's $5 and it turns your keyboard into like a mechanical keyboard via software yeah so that when you like type on your keyboard clock clock clock clock clock it makes that noise and you can like change you can make it go click click click click or clack CL clack and I just love the satisfying uh sound of it yeah um and I I mentioned I think I mentioned that the app isn't perfect but I just still enjoyed it and was the best I can found someone tweeted just now saying clack app is outdated and there's no sign of De however it feels good to trick my brain into having a mechanical keyboard rocket ship emoji and that's like a great example of like someone should buy this app yeah I mean that that is a great example right it someone should buy it maintain it improve it and I would imagine like you don't need to update it all the time but just make sure you maintain it and then that could be a great entry point for someone and then they see this whole ecosystem of other apps and then you can centralize the development especially with AI now like um to always go for the whole ecosystem of apps versus forcing the team to always be improving one when that one might not even need to be updated so and partner with a Creator on the distribution like partner like someone like me like I probably sent thousands of sales to this random guy who probably is not even checking his stripe account or whatever you got think about like what works on YouTube it's always like lifestyle Health Fitness making money and productivity you know productivity is probably one the like self-improvement productivity is a huge bucket so yeah partner with the Creator and you can either buy or build but buying probably makes the most sense because you could probably get a lot of apps and and if you were going to buy like let's just say you weren't you and you didn't have some a nest de to go and buy some of these apps like how would you how would you go about starting this if you didn't have a lot of money in your bank account could you I would probably build I I would probably take that route yeah I would probably build because that's probably more within one's control because raising money is going to be very difficult if you don't have like a reputation or track record um your email is probably going to get ignored if you kind of just ping them because they'll just be like who's this random person so I would probably start off trying to build cool and then do you think about you know if you are going to go build like a holding company for X like holding company for productivity or something how do you think about what makes a good uh Niche to go after that's a good question I think the thought that comes to mind I'm curious to hear your thoughts on this too um is the other so the other thread that's kind of tied to this and they do overlap a little bit which is Extreme product Market fit with a super passionate Community people that are into producct ity a really into productivity you could tie this to any hobby you know like fishing or golfing or whatever and I think they very specific Niche products are built for those super super passionate communities and that's kind of how I I I would think about it so I think one is there needs to be deep deep hold co founder fit meaning like you're obviously into productivity and you're a productivity nerd and and and you're one of them you know I'm one of them too I'm also a productivity nerd um so that wasn't like a dis or anything um but like very difficult to go and build a holding company for AI products if you're just an outsider you need to be an Insider I yeah and then I think the second thing it's your your point is around like is this is this community the type of community that goes on the top of rooftops and screams that they love you know love trying these apps and then I think the third thing is do these people have disposable income I think yeah disposable income and yeah I I would agree with that the other thought that comes to mind is um as a if you're a Creator kind of similar to what you're doing is just screaming at the rooftop say you're buying X in y category I I'm still kind of surprised that no one bought mint you know if the company's going to shut it down like somebody I'm assuming somebody could have raised their hand and said hey I'll buy it from you don't shut it down and you know I would assume those users are super valuable and passionate I've been using mint for over a decade that was surprising but I think it's it was owned by into it right and I think sometimes these big companies it's like they'd rather just shut it down than yeah um but that was a huge opportunity like I don't know you're right like I don't know that's that's a whole other opportunity which is like reaching out to big companies and their like their m&a departments being like hey my name is Greg Eisenberg I run m&a at XYZ Ventures GRE Greg Eisenberg Ventures at Greg Eisenberg decom um you're gonna love it um you know would love to chat with you about you know ways to work together and you hop on a call and you're like okay like we're buying companies and you know even even if you aren't buying hundred million doll companies you're buying a million dollar companies or something saying that you you know if you had mint like if you were if you were able to say I got mint for $25 million or 50 million do and you went to Twitter like and other places like you probably could have raised that money to buy it yeah probably but circling back to saying I think having some passion in the category a passionate Community there willing to pay and I think from Like A playbook standpoint making sure that either you're the content creator or there are content creators you could partner with for distribution and then if it's digital businesses having some natural knack for product because that's going to be where a lot of the value ad is going to be added so I think it's a great opportunity for repeat Founders I know that's a small subset really really really small subset but um but I would definitely start with one and kind of grow from your your background you know skillshare so education online education and Otis which was fintech uh acquired by public.com so you you know your backgrounds in education and fintech like in those two industries like are you where do you see the opportunity in those two spaces specifically and why aren't you why aren't you doing it I'm not doing it because I'm similar to what you write about you know like I don't want to jump on that treadmill again um but within education I think there's a huge opportunity for AI tutoring and it do also overlaps with fintech too with education I think there there's going to be a new wave I don't know like edtech 5.0 but I I do think everyone is going to have kind of like a like an assistant or an agent is I guess what they're calling the AI Community but like for AI tutoring for example like I just want to learn video editing but I don't want you know I I start skill Tri I don't sit through a 50-hour course and I don't want to sit on these nightly course cohort I just want to pingstone like Hey how do I do this I want them to hit me back really quickly I want to upload the video clip I edited and I want them to analyze it and then send me to the right places to to improve it or tell me how to do it exactly so instant feedback I think is going to be a huge thing I think it's very difficult to probably pull that off but you could either do like a more General one you could do it for verticals like skill based l learning or language learning um I could see that being a thing I I think that overlaps also with therapy like I think it would be really cool to just talk you know I got I got triggered by this moment here's what happened here's what I was thinking and it would ask me questions back and it would like kind of help me rethink about how he reacted and then also overlaps with like work assistant um so I think there's just going to be a whole Trend around assistance but within education I think like a tutoring coach or you know something like that is like I would love to just have one for all the things I'm working on yeah so yeah I'm hearing people talk about it as assistants agents characters is is has been the recent one um and so I do think that there's a there's going to be a huge opportunity to create characters or agents or assistants and I also think that doing deals with creators so being like like for video let's say uh video editing like how do you do a deal with Casey nayat so you can like license his name for that I think is an interesting idea that's GNA be pretty cool especially if you can if it is him that you're getting tutored from yeah and it's like his brain or his technique or his philosophy that got uploaded exactly so I could the new thing creators do instead of like courses like asynchronous courses or cohort courses it's hey for $10 a month like you can learn from me and I'm constantly updating the model and and fine-tuning it and and you can learn directly from me and the best part about learning from a character like that is you actually have to do the work to learn meaning like you're actually video editing in real time you've got the software up and when you have a problem that's when you hit them up so I think it's probably I would bet that it's probably like a really effective way of learning because it's learning by doing not learning by watching viewing watching learning by doing I think you're right is the most effective way to learn especially if you could do it and learn from others too in real time what are the other Trends are you seeing within AI that you find interesting right now it's really this characters like if if um how does that manifest you know well I think okay what is a character what could a character do it could either entertain you or could teach you yeah so if you if we believe that characters are going to be a big part of how people consume media and and education 10% 20% 30% then there's going to be tons of paid monthly memberships essentially to these characters that I'm going to have in my pocket similar to how we had when the App Store was created so my brain power right now is thinking about you know in the AI space at least if I want to create like which characters make the most sense to be created and how do they manifest itself and then when does it make most sense to go prime time also like are we ready for that or does it make sense to like kind of be you know be behind the curtains and just iterating on it iterating on it my gut says that like we're we're pretty close to prime time but we're not there yet what do you think is the like the use case that most people would want when the time is right or like well a good example I think AI girlfriends obviously are going to be you know I think uh I think there's no question that so the trends that I'm seeing are like yeah girlfriends education and entertainment and then the other AI Trend that I think will be big in 2024 is just interfaces so if you look at um like pdf. so you can like basically if you check pdf. chat with any PDF document from legal agreements to financial reports pdf. brings all your documents to life you can ask questions get summaries find info and more that's pretty cool exactly so the dude who started this actually is is really cool he he talks about like everything he builds in public and he talks about all his revenue and how he's doing and couple months ago chat GPT uh allowed the ability to talk with a PDF so you think that it was done for this guy but it wasn't because the search traffic for PDF and AI is probably still pretty high and it's purpose-built for chatting with PDFs like there's certain things that chat GPT will not be able to be amazing at so the interface for chatting with the PDF is is specific to to this use case so I think more niche specific use cases interfaces are really interesting and from like we're doing a lot of that work with you know our Innovation agency where we're designing a lot of these interfaces um Prett cool and thinking about it and that's sort of a bonus of running a design agency is yeah you you basically you learn a lot about you know okay how do I design AI interfaces and and uh you learn those problems and uh so that's that's sort of another reason why I like being in the space yeah I I could see I could see that happening and then the obvious company that could be built around that is kind of like a Shopify for creating your own character or I'm just thinking from a crater use case it's like being able to upload all my videos everything I've ever written and basically create my own character and charge for that and have this app or software just make that dead simple where like drag and drop yeah and I think in the past I would be like I want to create the Shopify but now I'm kind of like no no I just want to create the like the clavio um I want to build the app on top of that you know I think why what change your thinking from building this SAS business towards building something because that that's counter to what was like the 22010 like don't build on other people's yeah platforms build the platform that's right I know and but at the same at the same time I've changed man I've changed yeah at the same time it's like there's not that much Venture funding happening right now but it feels to me at least 90% of it's going to AI yeah and most of it is going to platforms like this so I just feel like I won't be able to compete in that space but where I can compete is in uh what I C you know what I do best which is like build you know building Community picking niches uh building great interfaces and coming up with things that are going to spread among people is where I want to focus my energy and yes could I get shut down by any of these platforms at any given time absolutely um that's the problem with being dependent on on any platform but if you don't take any outside funding and you build it to generate cash flow from day one it's just a risk yeah I think it also ties to what you're saying about sty points too yeah exactly like just building something cool with cool people and having fun and making money while you're doing it it's all it's like it's like 100x points versus the the alternative exactly so I think there's going to be I think some people are going to have portfolios at you know portfolios of these characters um just like how you saw people having portfolios of apps and software that is going to extend to characters that's gonna be pretty cool yeah scary but cool scary but cool scary coming from the old you know like the old dude the grayhair dude anything else off the list you want to cover okay so I had one one last thing I wanted to get your feedback on it's an idea let do it so it's related to AI it's haggle doai that's what call it okay and it's basically a character doesn't exist yet but that's what I'd call it okay and I'm and I'm really into domains now like I really feel like yeah you gotta I'm really into buying buy the domain you know haggle doai and it's worth it and it's basically no one likes to haggle with their vendors you know we have vendors that we pay thousands of dollars a month software I'm talking about specifically specifically and we're not going to have like we just like add to cart and it scales as our team grows but now our team is like 60 plus people and all of a sudden we're paying thousands of dollars a month and we probably should renegotiate it but we don't what if there was a character that you know did the haggling for you powered by AI I would say powered by like X FBI negotiators that have trained this model to be the best negotiation negotiators of all time and get smarter as the other side gets smarter with you know like and it just gets smarter and smarter and smarter so I think it could negotiate anything but you could wedge into well one I like the idea a lot but you could definitely wedge into renegotiating your software we we often forget about it but do not pay is like the OG it's like the OG AI software company do you know do you know do not pay yeah do not pay uses AI to help you fight B corpse corporations protect your privacy find hidden money and beat bureaucracy so it could fight parking tickets customer service Bank fees government uh money you're owed um car repossession City I mean I the lesses hundreds of things that they can help you with last I heard they were doing around $5 million a month of Mr wow so this is a uh and I don't think they raise much money yeah I like the idea of being able to negotiate or haggle anything like haggle X yeah you know I like that idea a lot and I would assume that it would come up with a set of like a process for how it do how it would do each one yes and you can just kind of pick and as long as you're saving people making people money or saving people money they'll always pay for it exactly yeah and do not pay I think is the validation for this so they've raised $10 million and and doing at least $5 million a month in Revenue um and I think the market for this as people get just more comfortable with AI characters and AI doing tasks is only going to get bigger yeah what are your thoughts on current companies moving into AI to defend against new companies that are trying to use AI to do what they're doing I'm trying to wrap my head around like that Turf battle that's about to emerge where like do not pay maybe didn't raise a lot of money they make a lot of money they probably have a great team great culture you know they could probably move pretty quickly into the space and defend I guess their territory if you want to use like a war analogy but what what are your thoughts on how that's going to play out I was talking to Eric ree about this from the Lan startup on one of my recent pods if you haven't if people haven't heard that that episode check it out we were talking about um this idea around May in terms of m&a maybe the move is you actually buy an existing company that doesn't have a lot of AI and then you just AI ify them and you create like a like that's the roll up strategy I think that's pretty smart I like that a lot yeah so I think that yeah I mean it's you know Facebook wasn't a mobile company it was a desktop company and now now they do now it's mobile right like I think there's AI is going to be ubiquitous just like cloud is is ubiquitous and social is ubiquitous so if it's going to be ubiquitous then everyone's going to go and it's just cuz you know it'll make the experience better then I think there's tons of opportunity to to partner with existing platforms yeah I I think that makes a lot of sense like this use case has a clear like AI strategy whereas maybe some other apps don't but this one has a has a clear clear one for sure would you buy or build this idea if you had to start you know because there are probably companies that are just human driven that just do this manually where they call and do it you know through the phone or email and then there's software like this and then there's like just building it I think I would prefer to buy it yeah because of all the data like that's the other thing is like the existing companies have a lot of data um and ultimately like the most valuable AI companies are going to be the ones with the most valuable data and they're just using AI to use that data and charge for it so what you know would love to buy it but I also think that there's I mean there's there's an opportunity to go from the ground up as well but I if I were to do it just like how do not pay started with just parking tickets do not pay parking tickets and now have expanded to like 30 different product offerings I would think about what is something small enough that I can do to learn in the space and get really and train the model to get really good at it that's also very viral do not pay parking tickets is a very viral idea that can get a lot of coverage people don't like paying who who likes seeing a parking ticket it's the worst right so what is the equivalent in in ha you know in haggle doai this fictitious idea what's what's what's a a service that people um or what's something that a toll or a fine or taxes maybe it's taxes um yeah yeah I like your approach with haggle around comp and paying for software I think there's nothing more annoying than when you get when you check your credit card statement in your company you're like who signed up for this app or where do this huge um invoice come from and then just like oh it's the app that we use but because we're bigger now they just start charging us Enterprise so there's also this really interesting shift happening in AI with pricing models so intercom has this product called Finn and Finn's usage is measured in resolutions this ensures what this ensures that only that you only pay when Finn does what you care about most resolving a customer's question a resolution is counted when following the last AI answer or custom answer in a conversation the C the customer confirms the answer provided is satisfactory or exits the conversation without requesting further exist so basically each resolution they charge 99 Cents for so I love that right it's like aligning your incentives imediately with haggle if you haggle the I mean you could even do it like per resolution or just a percentage of the money you save the other percentage of the money saved oh yeah that's so simple Nob brainer yeah someone likes this idea holler at your boy um Mike where can people find you learn more about your great ideas Mike car on Twitter Mike car.com for website I I just launched a podcast a few months ago you can search TKS or the K apricorn show on Spotify Apple Etc I I listen to it I love it and uh I was I was doing a workout today and watching you on my elliptical on on video same yeah I listened to your 2023 review which was pretty good I appreciate it man all right you're welcome back anytime um thanks for having me if if people like this episode uh tag us on Twitter and uh tell us what you liked what you didn't like um and uh thanks for tuning in to where it happens this is where this is where the ideas happen so we love to see it peace

Published: 2024-01-06 14:58:57 UTC
Description:
Building a business boils down to two factors:

when building a business most things boil down to desired outcome plus trust sounds really simple maybe sounds even really obvious but after the Reps that we've taken in selling in building teams and speaking to customers across different businesses those are really the two things that matter is desired outcomes what is the goal of the person that you're speaking to and Trust do they trust you to get them there to achieve those goals to achieve those desired outcomes many people spoken about this many people have talked about this but really when you're able to understand what people want and then have them trust in you that you will get them there especially in sales where you have a narrow window to be able to do that if you can master that everything else is gravy

there's this big opportunity to build like audience in a box business if you're big on any individual on any platform you'll probably be big on other platforms as well you just haven't gotten around to it yet so if you have a big YouTube channel like Colin Samir do or podcast why wouldn't you also have a big newsletter and if you can have support doing that it's kind of a no-brainer to go to any Creator who's big on any platform and say hey we'll help you get big on this other platform and give you a half of it there's so many people who want to expand their audiences across platforms a service that did this could charge quite a bit of money or even co- incubate or co-own some of these media properties hey everybody it's Eric torberg dude I'm honored the the rules are reversed exactly so for those of you who don't know Eric that's how Eric torberg Mr podcast man himself network of podcast introduces and it starts every show so I had to I had to put that in before you put it in I appreciate the tribute normally I have the pleasure of interviewing you on on one of my shows um but uh excited to come to yours today big fan I appreciate it man all right we got a lot to discuss you brought some heat uh as expected I want to start with the trends first and then we'll dig into some of your startup ideas so let's talk a little bit about let's start with uh the rise of the B2B Creator and what you're doing with turpentine and why you think that's a trend worth you know betting your career on yeah so a few years ago during the pandemic I started to watch what you were doing uh on on Twitter and I was like huh this is really interesting and I tweeted out something like there should be a a Greg Eisenberg for for for X where where uh like people should study your playbook go deep on a specific uh domain or sector uh write or podcast about the space and at the time you were you know obviously you remain going deep on consumer on community on audience building on sort of uh you know the rise of creators uh go deep on a space write or you know create media about the space whether it's writing or podcasting and then building you know products or tools uh that sell to people who who engage with your content uh and or investing right and so you were early to this trend and and people who were doing this uh in parallel with you were people like Lenny ritky right for product managers audience here obviously extremely familiar or pachy mcor or Harry stebbings these people including you you know Julian people who come on your show blew up the last few years um and so I saw that Trend and said hey this is just the beginning this this there's going to be a lot more people like this what Lenny is doing for product managers that will exist for every position for for uh Finance people for engineering for sales uh marketing Etc and that will also exist for every sector and so I wanted to create make a big bet on the the emergence or or the continued growth of Niche creators specific verticals business verticals um and create media for for those people and instead of create the next tech crunch for everything create the next tech crunch for a specific category uh so I started ttin as a podcast Network that basically you know today we are 13 podcast but instead of saying hey we're going to create the next Lex rman or Joe Rogan or you know hit show it's it's hard to create hit shows from scratch today but we're going to create the best show for CFOs or the best show for people in HR or the best show for people in Ai and uh We've niched down and um we think that these niches are only going to get bigger that the audiences are super valuable and um that these will be this will be not only a valuable media business but also just a valuable audience for me to uh incubate other products um or invest in businesses that sell to those Niche audiences so that's uh that that's what I'm up do with with turpentine is is Greg Eisenberg for for X Lenny for X starting with podcasts but then expanding to other other formats as well and why would you start with podcasts like to me that seems painful given that I run a podcast and I know how hard it is to to grow one um why do you think it's worth investing as a podcast first like what what am I what am I missing there so podcasts are underrated for a few reasons um One is because they're the only media that you can create that allows you to create every other form of media from a podcast so you create a podcast you can turn that into a newsletter you could turn that into a video you could turn that into um a community right because you have all these guests who come on um and you boom after 20 episodes of you having uh Chief people officers now you have this you know incredibly valuable Chief people officer Community or conference um so it's it's not that much hard work to get a podcast off the ground um in a niche area and um and establish yourself because there aren't like how many CFO podcasts are there not that many how many Chief people officer podcasts are there that are good not that many we we've created um you know just in the last few months I I think we have like a top three CFO podcast or chief people officer podcast um they don't have a ton of listeners um so you know under a thousand per episode but they monetize really well um because people want to sell that audience um and if you pair them with newsletters and you can build newsletters on top of the podcast um you could then monetize even better but yeah the punchline is the they're the medium where you could build every other medium on top of um and if you go Niche uh it's you you can create um you know pretty strong uh you know ranking right out the gate so the other thing that people aren't talking about is that social networks are becoming more video oriented so if you could own the Search terms for CFO or how I you know how to create a balance sheet um and then people consume those videos and then they're like okay let me subscribe to this person or let me go buy his or her product like that's the other that's the other bet I think that you're making because you're not really doing when people when people hear podcast they think audio but it's really video first podcast right yes yes and and they're just a special relationship you you know this someone who hosts a podcast that you get from from running a podcast that you don't get uh in the same way from from other other mediums because there's audio because there's video um and and just to put some numbers on it we're we're doing about 350,000 downloads a month across 13 shows which is which is not huge like some shows you know my first million does is bigger than all of our shows put together probably but we're at about 2 million run rate probably um because the show is monetized pretty well well like each show you know we were talking earlier like 30k a month or something like that like no show is huge but it's it's um it's kind of like the 8020 where it's just it's really hard to build a you know mainstream podcast today um from from a standing start but to get to a show of 30k 40K a month you know in a in a strong Niche it's not that hard and so if you if you can get a critical mass of of them you could start to build a a real business uh and then of course you could build all the other mediums on on top of them um and one one thing that people don't realize uh as as much is that when you look at media businesses of the last 15 years one of the most valuable media businesses is this business called industry dive which sold for $500 million to informa today it probably be worth a lot more and it was just a collection of trade Publications like HR dive CFO dive basically what I'm trying to do with with it with with podcasts and if you go to HR dive or CFO dive it looks like it was made in 2012 because it was made in 200 like they haven't really innovated on the format and so I've also been inspired by by workweek um which is a media business that's also trying to create the the modern-day industry dive and they they have more of a newsletter first approach and that's also why I wanted to differentiate um but the Val you know there's been a lot of money poured into media businesses of the last 15 years A lot of it has been poured into consumer uh media because that's where the attention is that's where the the splash is but Business Media these these these are just great customer acquisition channels um and so in in a world where you know distribution is more and more important acquisition is more more important it's easier and easier to build things um owning those distribution channels those acquisition channels um is is just going to be increasingly more valuable so so that that's why we're focusing on what we're focused on so how do you think about choosing a new B2B Niche because I think some people are going to be listening to this and being and be like wow like I I want to do this um but I'm not sure if this Niche actually is worth going after yeah so my my first business out of college which you you'll remember was a rap music business it's called rap fm and it was like uh Chat Roulette for rap battles so I was you know really uh interested in in in rap and still am and I that was a niche I wanted to focus on and there wasn't a ton of money there you know there there probably is much more today than there was back then because niches are just bigger and bigger but I mean today in terms of how we pick our our we really focus on like who are Enterprise buyers like who do startups try to sell to right they try to sell to um you know Finance people they try to sell to salesp people they try to sell to and you know CTO like who are these just buyers at companies HR leaders right um and having invested in a lot of companies I I kind of get a sense for who startups are asking me to to Target so part of it is Enterprise buyers um another part of it is just sectors that are that are important and that are that are hot and that aren't too crowded like crypto is Extreme extremely crowded or web 3 is extremely crowded there's there's a very mature media ecosystem and so we're not going in there at the moment um whereas AI um obviously is getting crowded there you know our our friend Ben tossel created Ben bites and other newsletters but it's still really early like there isn't a sort of you know the equivalent of a block works or a coin desk or a coin T this kind of mature media companies for AI just yet they're just a few newsletters that are that are taking off and so we're deciding in q1 to go much deeper on AI ac across platforms um so that's going to be our first um newsletter we're going to get into some news coverage as as well um and really kind of going on that vertical but um historically we've been looking at it hey who who who are just customers that are really valuable are Enterprise buyers or what are spaces that are really valuable and then what are spaces that don't seem too crowded where we think we could have a top five you know property within just a few months have you thought about acquir iring some creators in some creative way uh or acquiring a business that has a Creator attached to it like for example now I don't know if he's selling or would sell but like Ben tossel you mentioned Ben tossel like his newsletter Ben's bites like what if you could acquire that business and then strap on the podcast as a part of it I I haven't considered it uh in in seriously um because we're in the business of of ownership at the moment the the challenge of podcasts when you don't own the feed is that the uh the host can just leave you um and so if um so we only want to be in business at the moment in places where we own the feed because otherwise it's almost like investing in a startup but once the startup gets to you know gets a ton of traction you don't own equity in it anymore they they just don't want to to partner with you and so we want to be you know co-owners for Life otherwise the incentives get misaligned and you have sort of this Taylor Swift or you know um scooter braon like situation and then in terms of so in order for us to acquire majority ownership um it just either would require a bunch of cash which we're not immune to we did put a bunch of cash to see this business personally um but I just haven't seen the specific um thing that I that we should go by um but I'd love to hear your your take if you were me H how should I be thinking about um you know Acquisitions as a as a possible strategy well I think uh the interesting thing about owning something like Ben's bites let's say let's use that as the example is you know you mentioned my first million earlier you know my first million wouldn't be where it is today in my opinion if it wasn't for its partnership with the hustle yeah and the way it worked was Sam and Sean came up with a brilliant idea for a podcast executed on it brilliantly and they were consistent they did it you know every single week and uh then they use the the the pipes the media pipes of the hustle to help promote some of those um some of those episodes and still do that to that to this day actually like the HubSpot Network helped promote my first million now you could say well turpentine has all these shows we'll just cross promote and that's true but if you wanted to go faster and you know one way would be to acquire media and then find you know either new Talent or the founders like a Ben um to to create a show yeah one thing we've been doing is trying to partner with the biggest hosts we can find so basically inter Network we have py McCormick we have Noah Smith and um burn Hobart a few other kind of pretty big newsletter writers for their specific niches who have a few hundred thousand subscribers and we say hey you don't have a podcast today let's create one for you you all you have to do is show up and talk about the things that you've been writing about regardless and we'll give you 50% of of of everything in exchange for just you know an hour or so a week um and in exchange they promote it in the newsletters too so we are interested in partnering with people who already have distribution to borrow it um and if there's an opportunity to acquire something where it makes sense I'm I'm really intrigued I just worry about people's loss of motivation when they don't um when they don't own it in the same way or I wonder if there's a way to get kind of the benefits of ongoing distribution by sort of co-creating with with people already have it in different formats and then using the using you know those already existing user bases or distribution sets to uh you know bring them to to to the podcast and the collection of podcasts do you know the story The the company behind Colin samir's newsletter have you heard about this smooth media I I think the team from morning Brew um that's very talented that created a couple star at morning brew and is now trying to do that for other creators as well like pretty similar to what I'm doing yes well similar but different you know so col and Samir have this newsletter uh it's called the published press newsletter and it's a newsletter just for creators makes sense Colin Tamir YouTuber YouTubers who discuss Creator stuff create a newsletter they want to get off the YouTube treadmill so they have this newsletter and now has like more than 150,000 Subs yeah awesome so I started digging into it and I realized that it's a company called Smooth media that's behind it so basically they partner with um they partner with creators and then they do email newsletters uh for them and they write them Etc so it seems like seems like a lot of people are scratching the surface on this B2B thing um I like your angle for podcast first um because I think it's just harder and sometimes when you do things that are harder like there's more of a moat there yeah um so I like I like what you're doing um there's another note that you have here on this list that says media businesses are under monetized what do you mean by that first let me just say I I think there's this big opportunity to build like audience in a box business like if you're big on any individual on any platform you'll probably be big on other platforms as well you just haven't gotten around to it yet so if you have a big um you know YouTube channel like Colin Samir do or podcast like yeah why wouldn't the same you know why wouldn't you also have a big newsletter and if you can have support doing that um it's kind of a no-brainer to go to any Creator who's big on any platform and say hey we'll help you get big on this other platform and you know give you a half of it but we'll keep half of it right and so um there's so many people who want to expand their audiences across platforms this a service that did this could charge quite a bit of money or even co- incubate or co-own some of these media properties um is there something like this that exists yet I mean people are trying right like so smooth is trying you're trying we're trying you know we're all kind of we all have our own angle and I think what you're seeing is that 2023 there was just like scratching the surface 2024 I think we're going to see like oh turns out that podcasting with the right angle or Community was the right angle or email newsletter was was the right angle um so that's my prediction by the end of 2024 I think we'll have a pretty good understanding of like how creators and then specifically B2B creators because I agree with you B2B creators are you know are probably worth a hundred times more like you know if you have if you have 100,000 YouTube subscribers you know and as a B2B Creator that's like you're basically the Mr Beast of your world yeah um so that's my take on that yeah and and so let me get to back to how media is under monetized well it's interesting right we we saw people like Harry stebbings um pachy McCormack uh you know built these large Tech audiences and then raise funds on top of those audiences right hundreds of millions of dollars in in the case of Harry what people say a16z you know it's like 50 billion or whatever AUM they say it's a a media company that monetizes via Venture Capital right so clearly investing is a uh compelling um opportunity for people who are selling to um business creators at least in C certain categories right um but if you own this relationship with customer there's also additional things that you could be doing like maybe the next Harry stebbings um doesn't only do a um Venture Capital sort of a fund but maybe he also um sells services to other Venture Capital firms he has an agency you know that does fund management maybe he builds underlying platform or builds by builds I mean he's like an audience co-founder where someone trying to build the next Carta or angelist or whatever you know platform that sells to his customer set where he has the sort of widest set of customers and the most trust with with them just to name Harry as an example and VC as a as one example position but maybe they give him some percentage of the company for ongoing evangelism um so I think there those are two ways in which it's directly uh under monetized but there's another way which is there's a lot of data that media companies get as as exhaust that they don't monetize so I'll give one very specific example that was inspired by this business I saw called tus tus is an expert Marketplace if you listen to invest like the best Patrick oasi you've heard them adverti there um and so their expert Marketplace like a Gerson lurman group a GLG which is sort of one of the early OG expert marketplaces if you're looking to let's say you're you're at a hedge fund and you're looking to make a a you know biotech investment and you're looking to talk to some customers or or some people used to work at this company or people who have expertise on this on this space you'll ask GLG to set you up for a few calls you'll pay some money for those calls U you as the expert will get paid to those calls it's kind of an established category so what Tas does is they go into this established category and they say hey we're going to record the calls these calls are already happening we're now going to record them um in exchange for recording them we're we're going to uh take less of the sort of margin so it's going to be cheaper so it's it's a appear so it's it's it's cheaper for the person paying to in order to use tus as a result these calls get recorded they then build a database of these calls a data set of these calls and now if you're looking to learn let's say about biotech instead of having to um place an individual call you can now read the transcripts of dozens of calls in the same amount of time and so they've created a moat there just by using the the exhaust from these calls that were already happening now what do reporters or people in Media do um often is is they get insights they they talk to people all all the time right and so this Insight came to me when I was reading this report on stability AI that came out it was on Forbes it was a bit of a a bit of a negative piece uh and or Expose and this journalist uh talked to 30 reporters sorry sorry talked to 30 sources early employees Executives investors and then I looked at tus I was like oh wow this reporter talked to 30 people um I looked at tus and they just had a handful of people on stability AI so I was like wow this journalist is maybe sitting on the best data set in the world a qualitative data set in the world on stability AI who else in the world knows what early employees investors um you know what Etc um think about stability um and the only Revenue they're making is just the ad Revenue off that Forbes piece there whereas people on teus pay $25,000 per seat uh in order to to access those calls and the irony of those calls is if those calls were released to the broader public they wouldn't be that popular like it it's these this information is extremely valuable to an extremely small set of people um and so people the media businesses and media creators often don't price discriminate and especially if you're in Business Media if you can attract information that's extremely valuable to a very small subset of people you should be charging a ton um and so media especially journalists they often have this broad sense of informing the public and they kind of think the public is is equal but if you're reporting on business maybe your your you know your customer shouldn't be the person outside of tech who's just trying to understand what's happening but maybe you should be informing an investor on or your data that should be informing an investor on hey should I invest in stability AI should I join stability Ai and so most yeah most people who create media don't think who is the most valuable customer I should sell this to and what is the actual job to be done here or value prop that I I could sell them that I could thus charge a lot more perhaps so that's a way in which we think media is under monetized and in which we are going to try to do ourselves so we are going to uh create media that helps people do better at their job and identify um you know which companies are are doing well Etc we're going to get in the list game right top companies top people per sector get you use these this media to get all this insights all this data on people and companies and products and then try to sell that that data uh you know in a transparent way people know you know what they're signing up for there's anonymity Etc but to the most valuable uh you know the the the sort of customer that values it the most so that was a uh input on why I think media is under under monetized because they're not just providing eyeballs they're also providing data uh insights and and sometimes even determining reputation and and and that is is very valuable it's almost like the eyeballs are like the least interesting part yes exactly exactly that that that's well said like if you own the information just as a or Forbes or something and we're not constrained by sort of the U the idea of being a journalist which also interestingly today um people aren't constrained right the lenni the U's the pis the you guys could invest in the businesses that you cover you could incubate businesses and you're not people don't trust you any less for it um so that's an interesting development but let's say you you again information what other businesses could you create on top of that right they used to do org charts right it's almost like Craigslist right like remember the the same Craigslist graph where you looked at every sort of feature on Craigslist and saw oh that's that's Airbnb that that's this kind of business that's another business similarly like if you go in the information I see they have org charts oh wait there's a company called the org that just specialized in that they have like a different Professional Network I'm like oh wait okay there's LinkedIn like you can imagine building a professional Network off of that there's uh you know all all these data companies there's crunch base that just kind of you crunch base emerged from crunch right um so there's glass door you could imagine like media companies and there other POS there other things that are like this too recruiters what do they do all day they get all this data on people um one business I want to build is reference checks as a service right we do all these reference checks and yet no one ever compiles them or organizes them um and so and anytime there's a sort of a thing that is done all the time that's not recorded um that could have data as exhaust I'm interested in hey could you create something that structures that data that has like a give to get model um where people are incentivized to give data in order to to to see the data um and and building these kind of like information marketplaces using media as the as the wedge so what you're saying is similar to how there was the unbundling of Craigslist and I've talked about the unbundling of Reddit yes basically taking a subreddit a niche a subreddit Niche and then people building products for that yes for that niche there's going to there's this new B2B un media unbundling that's happening and you have you have the ability to build social networks you have the ability to build marketplaces you have the ability to build agencies you have the ability to build uh SAS tools um and the media is just the is almost like the the ticket to the ride yeah exactly I mean and I've I I've watched you and the businesses you've been able to to build the different the different agencies the different communities the different products and and a lot of it stemmed from your from your Twitter um and then your newsletter and the other stuff you you've built and I think I've realized hey like I enjoy creating but I'm I don't think I'm the world's best Creator uh I I don't I don't think I'm as good as good as as good as you are um but I I think what I could do is is find the Greg Eisenberg for x and help produce them or help incubate them um and and some people listening to this have that Creator drive or or that potential and some say hey maybe they're more of a producer or maybe they're more of a partner to these to these uh these these creators um I I think one thing that's underexplored also I I there's this massive Creator I don't want to burst a spot in case it's confidential but um at the level of of someone like yourself who has a chief of staff who gets 25% of everything he does and I think that's a really interesting model for someone who realizes hey I'm not the the Creator I'm the producer I'm the person who's going to let the Creator just be themselves and I'm GNA take care of everything else go up to someone you really mire say hey I'll I'll do literally take everything off your plate that you don't like doing that's really important going to get you to the next level give me some percentage of of what you make 10% 20% 25 whatever it is I feel like that's an opportunity for people so and that's what we're we're doing at T time we get 50% um and so yeah that's how we think about it yeah I think uh first of all I really like the producer versus Creator bit I'm gonna I'm GNA use that I'll credit you on that um not everyone needs to be a Creator yeah not everyone needs to be a creator that you back when like uh being an entrepreneur was really cool and everyone wanted to be an entrepreneur people used you know some people that I really respect would say not everyone needs to be an entrepreneur and now 2024 it's like no not everyone needs to be a Creator in fact I wouldn't be surprised if the producers actually do way better than the creators in the end um wouldn't be surprised just because they're more Diversified they can produce uh multiple projects um they learn like you're going to learn so much about you know what's working what's not working across your portfolio we we see that ourselves like we have a portfolio and we like we're doing uh an offsite in Miami next week with all the different leads of all the different businesses and they're going to all share what's working and what's not working yeah and as you know the producer you can look at that and be like okay maybe we shouldn't have incubated that AI business but let's go incubate something like this totally yeah and it's interesting like if you you know what I'm we're doing for podcast now what smooth media is doing for newsletters some people are doing for YouTube if you own a medium you get really good at any specific medium you can then go to people of course you can do it for for service and you know get paid but if you're if you're good enough you can co- incubate you can go to someone who doesn't have one of these channels and say hey what smooth media is doing say hey we'll create this for you we'll run the whole thing we we own we own 50% and want to be long-term Partners or whatever we own and our long-term Partners um and I I think that's just a different in in mindset it requires taking a bit more up upfront risk but if they're already big on a different medium you know you you've kind of Diversified it one example I'll give and I this guy's been immensely successful so I don't mean to take anything from him but Dave Perell uh you know he did his writing courses I think another business he could have done now he's not as passionate about it so you know he should do what he's passionate about he's been very successful but he could have instead of teaching people how to write he could have gone to people who either you know are big on other platforms or just have really valuable service businesses like um you know Financial wealth managers or accountants or lawyers or whatever and said hey I'm going to make you the biggest lawyer on Twitter or the biggest accountant on Twitter the biggest whatever and in exchange make me a 25% partner in your business and he could have done that with like five or 10 accounts or more um and really just been in kind of the equity game and and it's it's a shift in mindset from teach someone how to do something to kind of do it for them in exchange for a big chunk now if you do that you can work with they're trade-offs of course you can only work with the you know uh there's much limited number of people you can work with because it takes much more time whereas of course you can you know serve sort of uh you know infinite people in theory in terms of how however if it's asynchronous at least in terms of how many people watch it but you you then get in the ownership game and I I'm very excited about the ownership game how much have you studied music the music business a little bit rapm was in the was in the music business I mean labels were were amazing at uh sort of these 360 uh at at owning their their um artists and I have a friend who worked at this A6 this uh company called United Masters which tried to reinvent uh record contracts to look more like Venture deal to look more like situations where the entrepreneurs owned the most of the company instead of the VC or instead of the record label in the case of music and one finding he had was although I don't know how widespread this is or still today is that most artists or at least rappers actually preferred the deals the record labels gave them because they got more money up front um and they were able to do anything they wanted with that money and I think that's a little bit different between record labels and and VC like if you get a few million dollars from a VC it's Le I think it's less expected that you're able to just like pay yourself that I think in fact they encourage you to not pay yourself much I know people who rais 5 million BC paying themselves 50k salary like what are you doing you know they pay themselves you know hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars why don't you pay yourself anything but uh I guess artists just were more comfortable paying themselves a lot of their Advance um and so they preferred the the 1 million upfront and giving up 90% of everything they ever make then ever I mean of course they many of them regret it later on um anyways I'm I'm I'm rambling a bit that that's my familiarity with the industry so VC and music and the music business have a lot in common essentially they put up both put up money and they're producers but another way they're producers in your in your words and they get some upside um you know a lot of people including Kanye West uh say some say say some things about uh music labels that you know they they you know they're too they own their artist um and so I think that's not great um which is why I want to be in Co ownership I want to be hey let's be partners I don't yeah I think it needs to be partners right in the true truest sense and to to to defend the music labels a little bit like I'm sure not all of their deals are like that real you know but yeah you know I think what you're trying to do is feels to me very much like a music label co-ownership partnership style you're essentially approaching a B2B Creator and you're saying hey like uh uh let me go accelerate this for you um and then let's go you know put 1+ 1 equals 3 here and you know there might be some you know advance of some sort I'll get you advertisers I'll do this I'll do that I'll help build um and I think the takeaway for The Listener one of the takeaways is like don't be afraid to approach yeah uh creators and be like hey I want to produce and in fact the opportunity in 20 24 is the is the approaching and the producing in a lot of ways totally and it's interesting because yeah any Creator who has an audience on one platform uh probably wishes that they could have an audience on another platform and if you're good at that other platform they've already deris it a little bit by having an audience and showing product Market on one platform so going to them and saying hey let's create this on this other platform you know py has a big newsletter go to paky hey let's reach the same audience via podcast he says yes no Nob brainer but here here's an interesting thing like we did that in AI for example um with an AI Creator and now we want to create an AI newsletter and we actually don't need the Creator anymore because we can we co-own the podcast we're going to create he could create a newsletter too he can create meaning he can leverage the work we did on the podcast to help him and any other thing he wants to do in the future but similarly I guess we're I'm saying is we're borrowing using the Creator for their distribution but of course providing a ton of value giving them more distribution more more Revenue something they wouldn't have had otherwise but now because we've we've sort of you know established one format we can go in another format and then create our own owned uh sort of audience say hey we're gonna do it 100% ourself um we're gonna and and this is how we're building our brand we're building the the brand off you know great Partnerships with creators that we then go into other platforms say hey now this is the turpentine AI newsletter and and yeah we'll feature we'll promote the podcast so he's he's happy to and promote his his stuff um Etc but um the if if you're a producer and you you know or even a Creator and don't don't have an audience partnering with a Creator in one format to to help you get out there right we have this friend safwan who's who's an up andc Comer who partnered with Michael kch to create a podcast and he I think the value exchange was that he did a lot of the the work for it they get seen as co-hosts that grows saf's audience now safwan can use that for for other things um but yeah being able to add value to other creators helps you build your audience that then you could use for other things is a takeaway I like it man I like it so um is there room for all of us I I I I think so I mean you identified early on that these niches are getting bigger and bigger and bigger and it's it's interesting right like because Venture capitalists have raised more and more money the the expectations of what they need for returns are much higher right so um it used to be like1 billion doll business uh that they that was like Venture scale then it's like1 billion doll business you know at some point it's going to be a hundred billion dollar bus business right and so a lifestyle business is just a business that's not appropriate for for a venture and so as the Venture expectations have gotten bigger because all this money flooded the ecosystem these um the the what people call lifestyle business is much bigger like if it can only you know make a 100 million in Revenue maybe it's a lifestyle business for for some VCS right but that that's massively life life lifechanging you know and so these these niches are are getting bigger um and also these areas where VCS aren't touching um you know as much are are are getting wider um which means there's there's less competition perhaps um and um yeah there's there's I mean you called it a few years ago you know any any subreddit where there's just a growing Community there's probably a a big business waiting to waiting to be built there um if you see a Creator in one format perhaps you can help that Creator get to get to the next the next format maybe become the Creator yourself or or become the entity that produces a a bunch of creators but uh it still feels very early Innings particularly in in in in business uh creators we're looking to talk to you know anyone who's creating something for a certain sector or for a certain valuable business uh audience um and um yeah yeah feels feels uh feels like it's just the beginning the short answer is yes there's room for not just only us but really like there's thousands literally thousands of business ideas tens of thousands of business ideas for creators out there um B2B is interesting um you know we're also really focused there um there are some opportunities in B Toc um but my take on this is and I'll tell you a little story I haven't shared this publicly but we uh my take is basically that the top 50 creators in B Toc are uninteresting to collaborate with and we had a Creator top YouTube Creator and when I say top I mean top 10 top 12 YouTube Creator come to us we had his trust wanted to collaborate and wanted to co- incubate something um and we walked away from it and we walked away from it cuz you know that particular I'm trying not to give it away but basically like it was funny type videos and there wasn't a niche there there wasn't a strong Niche it was just like I would watch people would watch it when they just wanted time to pass they did weren't really really connected to that particular Creator so I think those creators are not that interesting but there are consumer creators who have a niche that the audience has disposable income that you could produce with yeah totally um but one thing I just find so interesting as an aside Greg is like you're not someone who came up as a 22-year-old thinking about kind of this new Green Field of Niche um ideas you're someone who kind of did it the old way and built a lot of cred in in the old world so to speak of you know raising a ton of venture money having worked for a a venture um you know backed company or the biggest one in in in in we work and there was so many incentives to just keep going down that path in in some ways and and there's a lot to walk away from in terms of I'm sure some some people came up to you were like hey what are you doing like you know that feel feels weird like it's the Golden Era of raising VC and and you're saying hey don't raise VC and so it's so much harder when you have stuff to to walk away from and that that's why I used to say things like it was easier to get into crypto if like you came up in it or something because you didn't have all these people saying oh that's weird but but you did and I think that's inspiration for people who are already down a path who either you know raised a bunch of money or are in a space that doesn't feel that that that exciting or it doesn't feel like you're on the sort of you know what what's going to happen if if you're listening to this you kind of have a Vibe for for where things are going and what types of people are going to have more and more career capital and it's the it's the 's it's the sahil blooms it's the you know sha sha Pur Etc and so I I just hope that is inspiration for people listening that um you can take that that different path even if you're already uh down a path and if if you know if people are thinking that hey the path is weird maybe you're doing something right um or you know maybe you're you're you're on to something because you're exploring something that is on the upswing that people haven't figured out yet and so that that's both an opportunity for people who haven't who are just upand comers and getting their start um to explore something that's underexplored um but on the up and but also so people who who've been in the game for a while well first of all I appreciate you saying that um thank you the reason I had this come to Jesus moment was because I saw how the sausage was made and once I saw how the sausage was made I realized that this not only it just wasn't for me it just was not for me um you know you talked earlier about how sometimes Founders don't pay themselves after even raising millions of dollars and that's really true true and not really spoken about when I was running Islands I paid myself a $75,000 salary in San Francisco which like goes nowhere um and uh and in the last 12 months I didn't even feel like I deserved a salary because I wanted to extend the runway so I didn't I stopped taking a salary so there's so many examples of venture Venture back startups and and where that can go and and I just I'm happy that more and more people are sharing it and that's one of the reasons why I like the podcast is it gives me opportunity to share these stories and yeah like I could have gone I was at we work close with the SoftBank folks like I could have just gone and been a partner or whatever at SoftBank for the rest of my life and sold money to people um but no I and I honestly like I find this this path to be for me at least way more interesting I don't know about you like how are you you you also have a background in in Venture raised a lot of money uh what how do you feel about this new kind of Rogue path that we're on it's been an adjustment so so yeah raised a lot of money in the past from from a lot of the big names and when you raise money from Big names you get invited to fancy parties and people come up to you and just give you all this validation all the time and people um you know venture capital firms became so good at marketing where they convinced Founders to take a lot of their money more money than they ever needed right uh I remember at product hunt we raised a seed round we had like $2 million or something maybe 1.5 or $2 million in the seed round and then a few weeks later we got a term sheet a series a term sheet from Andre and harwitz and we didn't even know how to spend the $2 million let alone the 8 to 10 that came after it but it was and I love I'm a big you know I'm I'm friends with uh that that firm but that money was just so enticing and and and you know did we need the money not really right um was was that the right thing for the business unclear but um the firm and just VC in general is so good at being a signal to the market that our company is one to be taken seriously and people should want to join our company people should want to trust uh you know customers should want to trust that and so it's incumbent on startups and startup ecosystem to have other version this is why I'm excited about media too other versions of that signal other versions of that blessing that don't come with major dilution over overly capitalized businesses and um and expectations that are way ahead of where the business is going and there needs to be other entities that can bless these companies with that signal um that don't come with the same sort of constraints so you ask me how it's going it's been an adjustment because I haven't been invited to all the same fancy parties or I I haven't had the same level of validation people say oh what are you up to I say oh you know I'm working on this Media company oh that's cute you know it's but when are you going to go for something really big and I'm like oh no wait this is like the infrastru one this is big but two this is the infrastructure and I didn't raise any Venture for it and people just think you're going small right but people don't realize like the male Champs and zap there's a lot of businesses um or there's at least enough businesses that have gotten massive massive scale that barely raised any Venture money or didn't raise any at all and venture capitalist would have loved to put money in the same way that there's you know lifestyle business is kind of this like euphemism there should be a similar euphemism for a business that's like too good to raise Venture money right like the mail Champs or zapier like V capus would die to put money into it but it's too good of a business it doesn't need this upfront like you know massive capital and dilution and expectations and bosses as you've been you know writing about how you investors you you've got bosses and and I have a friend who uh who got his business to 30 million a year ARR totally bootstrapped uh it's a service business he he did just raise some money because he wants to go really big on on AI and and that's and he always wanted to take some some money out that's great for him but um you know it's easier to to get businesses off the off the ground it's easier to get distribution and if you don't need capital for it why raise it so it's a it's a bit of adjustment but I think what you and I and other people are doing are showing examples of success like businesses that achieve real success that didn't need to raise money that were in fact um sort of advantaged for for for for not raising money and I have in it's increasingly in the same way that a lot of our friends want to do personal holding companies which we we'll get to in minute but a bunch of our friends who've raised hundreds of millions or even more in capital say hey I don't want to do that again I I don't want to do that anymore I I want to raise zero and now it's like a we need to turn it from a you know something a sign that you couldn't raise money to a sign that you're you're too good to raise money like you you know the the cost of it and you don't need it anymore well let's just change the name of exactly of unicorns unicorn Founders and unicorn companies to like a unicorn company isn't something that gets to a billion dollar valuation it's something that gets to a billion dollar value you know if you can get it's something that gets to like 10 million in cash flow that to me is a unicorn company yeah and a unicorn founder is someone who could do that it's like your buddy yeah no totally it's crazy I'm making my goals for 2024 and when I look back at my goals for previous years it was like okay get this you know my my company to 20 million in revenue and to this growth percentage but like those were the wrong metrics like th those metrics were based on what investors wanted right they wanted to see a graph up and to the right of of Revenue but that that didn't take costs into account right or or growth but that didn't take retention into account right and so now I'm thinking about hey these are goals just for me and it's like wait what exactly should the goals be it's just like a totally different way of uh of thinking about about business building when when you're Your Own Boss as opposed to your your investors and your investors just have a different um level of risk reward given they're you know extremely Diversified and you know playing lottery tickets so can you talk a little bit more about what your goals are for 2024 yeah I'm I'm creating them right now but I I want turpentine to uh I I want a million dollars in my bank account as a result of you know next year uh terpentine um so it's less of a revenue number for the company and more of of you know what I take personally um I also but I'm also going to keep reinvesting into the in in into the business so I want us to get so have a distribution goal as well I I want us to hit a million monthly podcast uh listens we're at 350 right now I also uh have a news newsletter goals well I'm still figuring out what what's the right number we're at zero today um but I want us to go big on newsletters but there there are a couple other things I want us to get into as well I want us to get into the reputation game I I think lists are very powerful if if done well and I want to really establish oursel um in in the list game um and then I also want to start this expert Network um and so and and I want to create this flywheel between this um sort of the reporting that the media company does and um that data entering this this sort of exp Network or the transcripts each call should be a transcript that enters this this this database that is compounding um I also have a few other reputation products I I I've just launched one is a VC rating system one is a uh service provider rating system one is a SAS tool rating system or review site one is a company review site I'm going to have individual metrics for or a company reviews yeah like a glass door competitor individual metrics for for those and those are going to be part of this Bookface competitor that I'm launching this a social network for for Founders um so high level intention for 2024 it's it's build the infrastructure the infrastructure that is going to help me uh create more businesses and you know have more kind of cap uh ability to invest or like get into deals that I'm excited about um by just having more leverage like I saw how product hunt and on Deck just gave me so much leverage because people wanted me to in their Network or on the table because I can get them distribution and I can get them talent and I want to create those same sort of bworks in the the broader Empire I'm building on the distribution side and part of distribution is also reputation um but then also on and and and then also on the talent side and so there's going to be a you know tangible sort of distribution you know uh audience size and you know profit numbers related to that but also this broader sense of hey uh you know am I building the infrastructure that makes it easier for for me to incubate more more businesses on on top of that so that's what I'm thinking about 2024 I like it I like it big year um we only got a few minutes left um I want you to give folks a few free startup ideas or things they should be thinking about what you got yeah okay so I mentioned that I'm really excited about reputation uh one idea I have is a is quora for people basically a search engine for ex you know who's the X for y I'm in um you know who's the best dentist in Miami or who who's the best fintech investor or I'm going to New York who should I meet we see these questions on Twitter all the time or Facebook they have tons of Engagement and then they're never stored and so I'm really interested in the intersection of Engagement and kind of like State you know stored State and so you could go on Twitter and scrape all these questions you you use llms to somehow find a lot of these questions um organize them structure them create your own social network work just for these um just for these questions um and then find uh you know who who to sell them to uh because similarly to what I said earlier it's not like like some of this information is really valuable to a small subset of people so that's a space I'm curious to to explore speaking of uh things that are really valuable to a small Subs of people um the dating space I I think people are going around at the wrong way they're they're not price discriminating I I I think if we were to ask single people how much would you pay of your what percentage of your net worth would you pay to find your partner in the next year or two especially people in their 30s right um I I think it's fair to say that a bunch of people would say something like 10% 20% maybe even more and so I think there is a big up uh opportunity to build sort of a high-end combination coaching plus matchmaking business almost of like what an executive recruiter does so we paid you know 100K plus to get a COO or to get a CFO and that recruiting firm not just didn't just source for us they took us through the whole process and made sure we found one it's like yeah you could find a CFO on your own but if you pay 100K you're definitely going to get one and they're going to stay with you until you get one and I I think something similar on the on the matchmaking front and I've only seen solutions that do either matchmaking or do coaching but not not like personal trainer style like just make you make sure it's you know do it for you almost like be in the dating apps for you and I I think yeah exactly I think in general it's a big trend of like shifting from like teach you how to do something to like press button and it's done like do it for you and this sort of like going from coaching to person like personal trainer doesn't just tell you what to do he also like or she watches you until you do it um and I you know I like solutions that that do that um for people because there's all this education and it's great but it's rare to have you know someone who will take the the whole end and I think there's something at the the intersection of like and you've thought about this too in different ways but coaching accountability um sort of you know executive assistant um that just kind of is there with you personal trainer for Life basically what are the areas in which you want to grow like I I looked at my 2024 goals and one thing I'm doing and I'm lucky enough to have some people helping me but hey EAS are cheap you use Athena and get it you know pay you know a few bucks an hour I $6 an hour for an assistant and um you can get someone to to help you out too and I'm putting that assistant next to those goals like it imagine having someone whose job it is to achieve your goals for you um like the the level of not just accountability but support that you will get from that is is is is really powerful so i' love a service that takes that to the next level maybe that just is Athena but you can imagine it app to different spaces like like relationships as an example yeah and I don't think it's Athena like I don't think it you know because it's it needs to be purpose Built For This exactly yeah exactly all right man idea machine I like it I also like that the underlying theme of this whole conversation has been price discrimination yeah and it's like how do you sell the most expensive thing to a small group of people yeah and start there it doesn't mean you can't democratize it and build for everyone tear yeah tears but um so I like that I like that where could uh people get to know you more uh Twitter uh check out uh I'm Eric torberg on Twitter I have substack I tpe time.co if you want to check out what we're doing if if you loved any of the ideas that that I'm I'm working on I see myself as as wanting to to build a studio and an incubator so do uh do reach out if if you're inspired to take on any the ideas and just uh want support or want a potential partner on it you got to come back on again man yeah it's been an honor to be here Greg uh always always love chatting with you and brainstorming we got to do our next uh Pita yes absolutely you you left Miami I can't believe you left Miami I know it was it was hard but I'll I'll come back and visit was it because there was just torenberg Eisenberg you were getting mixed up you know you could yeah I didn't know there was enough Bergs uh yeah no it was a it was a good run but uh there was a moment where I just need did more professional and personal Serendipity in my life yes and uh so I came back so end with this San Francisco how is it versus like our San Francisco 20 2012 2019 wasn't the same you know but it's it's it's it's not the same but it's back um it's it's you know people have left there's a whole new a lot of people like we came with Ryan Hoover like he's gone like David Spinx he's gone like a bunch of people right a bunch of people are friends they're gone but there's a whole new crop a whole whole new you know set of uh young people who who who came in and and one thing that's different that I is there's a sort of Consciousness to San Francisco about um sort of making San Francisco great which is like making it a safe place like getting there are people who are now like running for office who were previously doing tech companies and that's exciting to me because one of the things that I Mi that I sort of Miss about Miami or or didn't like about San Francisco was it felt that everything was just about tech and there wasn't really enough diversity and now I'm seeing all this kind of like Community activism energy um and it's uh is just giving a new flare new excitement and and it it makes me feel like part of something um part of something bigger than than just just myself or just my company it's like no let's actually like make this city great if you're in your 20s and you want to start a turpentine or lay checkout type business do you do San Francisco New York or somewhere else I think the answer used to be um you had to be in San Francisco if you were trying to build a tech company now I think you can probably be anywhere um but you know I I I I still think on the margins probably San Francisco or New York or just wherever there's a concentration of you know amazing people like wherever you can find your tribe that that's where you should go like in San Francisco when I first moved here I couldn't find my tribe for a couple years so it wasn't a great place for me uh so I'd almost like find them online um like see where people you want to meet where do they live um and people you can you can meet too and then just go there like if you're able to get into the Austin scene with Dave Pell and Justin Maris and all these people like go to Austin right like so or so that's I would think about is like where where can you find your tribe and look online first or if you want to come hang out with me and Ryan Hoover in Miami yes exactly come come do that so I won't take it personally um and uh appreciate the time later yeah appreciate you bud

In business, there are things that you simply cannot buy.

While things like vendors and customer relationships can be easily bought, there are no shortcuts when it comes to getting a deep understanding of your customer.

Coming up with an effective business strategy requires you to understand the business at the level of the customer and what they actually need.

Title: Do THIS Before Launching A Start Up, With Lean Startup Eric Ries

Is “not having a plan” really the best plan? 

While it’s true that sometimes it’s best to let life guide you, in business you want your decisions to be as informed as possible. 

Coming up with solid a strategy will give you a better ability to test your ideas against reality. This is what we call “minimum viable product” — a new, basic product that is used to validate customer needs and demand prior to developing a more complete version of that product.

people have kind of moved away from the idea that having a plan is even a good thing at all and that doesn't make sense either to the extent that people are capable of building some kind of strategy that makes sense on paper then you have a much better ability from that to go test that against reality and discover where you're wrong and then adjust whatever things need to be adjusted it's why we called minimum viable product a product not an experiment or a test or hypothesis we wanted to remind people that although we are removing features and we are Des scoping in order to get learning we're still trying to build something that is fundamentally useful

Description:
https://www.youtube.com/@GregIsenberg

This is why some people don't find entrepreneurship fulfilling.

Founders can get so caught up in their vision that they end up using their employees like tools instead of a team.

Once you realize this and let go of the urge to control everything, you’ll be able to be more effective and do more things for the world.

once you let go of the compulsive need to control what happen and once you realize that you're using people as tools to accomplish some goal like you're not treating them like full human beings that's part of why you feel so bad once you let that go you can experience a release that is very powerful allows you to do more things in the world be more effective because you're not wasting so much energy on all that inner turmoil so yeah I hope more Founders will pay attention to that side of things

Title: Stop Sitting on The Sideline, With Lean Startup Eric Ries

The faster you can fail, the faster you can succeed. 

Having a “fail fast” mentality can help you identify ideas that don't work so you can quickly move on to a better approach.

Don’t just sit on the sidelines waiting to come up with the perfect idea. Test the imperfect one you already have and see what happens.

I'd rather you do something that is doomed to fail and it's a terrible idea because that gives you the chance to Pivot into something that actually might work versus sitting on the sideline and doing nothing

hello I'm going to do a 2023 year review not going to hold back want to tell you about my biggest wins my biggest losses my epiphanies my productivity unlocks my net worth update my personal investment breakdown my social media update and more I don't want to hold back at all and the idea is if I share some of these things with you hopefully it triggers an idea in your own business or your own life and that's all I got asked for so if that sounds cool uh I'll get started so big wins I got married so I'm 34 got married had a small wedding with our immediate families small ceremony we had dinner at this cute little French beastro in Montreal highly recommend a wedding like that not a big thing not hundreds of people uh and it was just nice to have both of our families just immediates and conversing eating breaking bread I love that we did like we went to the a court in in Miami Beach and just did it here and then we went back to Canada where we're both from my wife's from Toronto I'm from Montreal and we did a little ceremony SL dinner there so that was big that was really really big and still processing how fun that was and and what it means for the next chapter but that was obviously the biggest win another big win is we bought 50% of a business business which became boring marketing.com which is basically an AI enhanced SEO business so it's some tools that help companies get organic search and that was our first real acquisition the crazy thing is by next year or in 2024 I should say the business conservative conservatively will do $2 to3 million of free cash flow and uh it's quite a reminder of the fact that you only need a couple good ideas to have a wonderful career and life it's kind of like Warren Buffett and Charlie munger's Vibe where they they really just sit on their hands a lot of the year and just try to come up with a few good ideas because if you can do that uh everything else clicks so that was a big win uh the other big win was we produced nice cash flow for late checkout which is our holding company and we continue to grow several cash flowing businesses which is awesome so the hold Co made money all the individual businesses made money so if this isn't product Market fit I do not know what is so our core thesis of community- based products outperforming non- Community Based products seems to be working and that feels really good you know a lot of people ask me how do you know if you have product Market fit well you'll know it when you see it and I definitely feel it and see it another big win is I started writing my newsletter weekly so have a newsletter can subscribe at Greg Eisenberg dcom and I for the longest time had had this newsletter but I would only I would only write once in in a blue moon maybe once every two months three months whenever I felt like I had something to get off my chest that's when I would uh write and I got convinced that writing weekly uh was a good thing to do and I was kind of anti it for a while because I was like how am I going to come up with something that's unique every single week in a deep format and uh I started thinking about Seth Goden he's got this incredible incredible blog that he's been blogging daily for for like 15 years I think it's seth. blog and I realized if Seth can do it daily I can do it weekly and that's exactly what I did some of my posts were longer some of my posts were smaller um but I wrote weekly and it really really impacted all of our businesses because I was able to promote our businesses through the newsletter and it also just made me a lot more clear around my thoughts which was priceless so forget even the promotion of the businesses through my newsletter the clarity that I was able to get was worth it if I just got that Clarity it would be 100% worth it so I definitely recommend starting a newsletter another big win is someone offered us and not just someone someone I really really respect and a top tier investor offered us $30 million of private equity Capital to scale outlay checkout we didn't take it but it did feel quite good always feels good when you get validated yeah that that just that was dope there's no other way to describe it it felt really awesome and although Venture and private Equity isn't for us right now we're just happy to self fund it it was cool to to get the offer and to say no was really cool and the last biggest win is stay true to myself so I didn't get distracted from competition or other Founders trying to build the biggest business or the most amount of followers most amount of likes the highest amount of YouTube subscribers just did what I thought was right and uh maybe that's the biggest win of all no getting married is the biggest win but maybe it's the second biggest win so stay true to yourself so what were some bad big losses for 2023 for me well for one we listen to some bad advice for our Innovation agency which is called late checkout agency someone once told us early 2023 keep your team lean recession is coming your fortune 500 clients will cut Innovation budgets and it it made a lot of sense because we were seeing in the news that tech companies were doing layoffs everyone was saying there was going to be a recession logically that made a lot of sense of course we're not going to higher and higher higher we're just going to sort of do the same and the reality is these companies that we work with need new products to drive D Revenue in community which is what we do we help them build new products that are beautiful and that drive community and turn customers into raving fans they need that even more during a rough market so if things are tough they need these new products so we basically had full utilization of our team the entire year and we lost at least $3 million of Revenue if we just would have not listened to this advice we would had three plus more million dollars in the bank so that definitely sucked and I think we LED on that particular business with this particular thing we LED with fear instead of leading with courage and we knew our team was really really world class and and really we think the best at at this so we should have been on the offense um I wouldn't say we were on the defense we were just kind of just doing our things we had the same amount of clients we we did get gain a few new clients but we were very very uh part you know stayed the course another big loss is you know there's a saying in entrepreneurship Higher One to higher 10 and I wish I did more of that in 2023 those are The Hires that multiply the business when you look back on a year The Higher One to hire 10 people really really Chang the trajectory of where you're going and although we did hire a few we didn't hire enough and last big uh big loss of the year is I didn't do enough two to three day IRL masterminds a mastermind is basically when a group of people come together usually in a similar industry and you spend like a few days together sometimes it's in a different city than you live in and then ultimately those that group keeps you accountable and support each other and help each other out and I I used to do this all the time and by all the time I mean like at least once a quarter you know once a quarter I think is a really good um it's a really good Cadence I guess because of covid I just like got out of the loop of that got out of the habit of that don't do that these are key these are amazing these are these are this will give you inspiration so for 2024 I've got some plans to do a quarterly Mastermind so I can connect with uh people in the industry in these smaller groups because I do think these like big conferences are overrated but these small IRL masterminds underrated so let's talk about some aha moments I had during 20123 so one is that multipreneur is the future of Entrepreneurship so multi R preneurship some of you have heard me talk about this concept it's the idea that someone creates multiple products per year with the aim of creating a company that creates companies so basically what I did with late checkout and when I started lay checkout 3 and a half years ago I considered it a holding company and I considered myself to be an entrepreneur but now I consider myself to be a multipreneur which I think is like a new breed of founder that you're going to see a lot more of us over the next 5 years I think there's going to be a huge wave of successful multipreneur over the next 5 years just like over the last couple years you started to see the wave of solo preneurs all over so maybe you're one of those multi preneurs or maybe you're a solo prer that might involve evolve to a multier but that's just a big realization and different you know I guess now I have a different mindset and fra yeah frame of mind as a multipreneur second aha moment I have had was this idea around IRL is greater than URL meaning there's just so much Alpha in creating products that drive IRL community experiences I think there's so much postco that we can do you know we were glued to our screens how do you get off the screen I had a quote that went viral in 2023 which is the internet used to be a place to get away from real life now real life is a place to get away from the internet and I think that's uh I think it's pretty true I think there's a lot of demand pent up demand to create interesting experiences in person so that's another frame and AA moment that I had in 2023 which might be useful to you too the third is that premium domains work I used to be one of those people that someone would come to me and say oh I just bought this $100,000. comom premium.com for my startup and inside I'm like what that is such a waste of money why wouldn't you spend that on the product why wouldn't you spend that on Direct response that $100,000 could have been 50,000 customers until I saw how much of an increase in conversion rate you can get when it comes to a great.com especially in B2B so I've seen this a few times in 2023 and I'm starting to think that premium domains are undervalued some of them uh so definitely interested in buying premium domains and now I'm like kind of like I don't even want to buy a regular domain I'm like that's I'm out on regular domain so something to think about the other aha moment I have is marry the niche date the product so what that means is you can give up on a product but don't give up on the niche you believe in so it's common for your product to fail when you build something it's product for your product to fail or if you're a content creator it's common that you create content and it's not hitting but don't give up on the niche you believe in so try different things in your Niche don't be so quick to give up the fifth AA moment is I want to hire more Canadians $1 US dollar today is about a135 Canadian so basically hiring in the Great Wide North is 35% off we hired some exceptional Canadians in 2023 and I want to do more of it obviously continue to still hire in the US but only for select high impact roles because I'd love to save that 35% and put that into a premium domain or put that into marketing or put that into a product another aha moment is reach out to people sounds obvious but I started doing that more in 2023 just random reaching out and I ended up meeting some of my heroes you know I reached out to Rivers Cuomo frontman of Weezer some guy who you know when I was 15 years old obsessed with so so cool to to do that all from Twitter and hang out with him in 2023 I even met a business partner of mine in 2023 so this guy Jordan he designed one of my tweets you know I had a tweet and he designed it and I hit him up and U all of a sudden he became a business partner so if you aren't sending a few DMS a week you are missing out and then the last aha moment is buy more companies I remember Andrew Wilkinson co-founder of tiny which is uh similar to a lay checkout a bigger late checkout really in lots of ways worth hundreds of millions of dollars I think probably I think it's worth almost half a billion dollars I was on the phone with him in 2020 and he he asked me he says why are you so focus on building and incubating companies buying is way easier and my response to him at the time was it's way more fun to build and I believe that true today but still want to buy more in 2024 so I just see the opportunity and I think I can do both from our experience with boring we can do both so if you're selling your agency your Marketplace your email newsletter your vertical SAS your social network get in touch with me we're buying community based businesses I had a few product activity unlocks that I wanted to share some of them are very small but are meaningful one is I in 2020 three started to change my desktop wallpaper monthly I always pick minimalist stuff I don't want like something that's super super busy right now I have like a space background it's like a bunch of galaxies but it's it's black and it looks like a bunch of stars when I log into my computer it like fires me up and uh I also I used to be one of those people with like a few things on my desktop maybe more than a few things I I care to admit you know maybe not the cleanest desktop and in 2023 my desktop was super clean I wouldn't let a file Linger on it so the productivity unlock is yeah just change your your wallpapers make it a point to do it and keep and do do some cleaning second productivity unlock 2023 salads for lunch call me basic but salad is healthy keeps it light that way I'm not working and it's like heavy in the afternoon or have any crashes so I I do recommend a salad for lunch I probably do it four times a week put some protein ideally in there as well put Chicken shrimp steak whatever floats your boat and uh less crashes and then just DND mode on desktop and mobile Nob brainer you can still set it so when certain people call they're it's very important husband wife kids parents whatever that it it comes through but you got to focus on on the task at hand and the last one relates a little bit to this which is I hide I I'm on a Mac I hide my top bar and like the top bar where you know it shows the Apple icon and stuff like that and it only shows up if I hover over it I just want to focus on the task at hand that's been a productivity unlock as well and I also hide the dock at the bottom so I have to have to hover over it to see it and I also use ARC browser which is like this new cool browser that when I am in it I don't see the sidebar I've hidden hidden the sidebar so it's a full screen browsing experience which is also been a productivity unlock so let's talk about um my update on my audiences how am I doing on my newsletter in January 2023 I had 36,000 subscribers today I have 72,000 subscribers so pretty good but I didn't spend spend any money on Advertising unlike my peers who have a lot of a lot of my friends spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on advertising and probably got their money back so the question to me was should I have written weekly and grown like paid for ads at the same time maybe but I wanted to prove to myself and prove to you person who you know I'm writing to that I can produce value so I didn't do both at the same time was that not thinking big enough maybe you let me know in the YouTube comments if you feel that way Twitter a year ago I had 280,000 followers today I have 361,000 followers which I think is pretty good uh the interesting thing is most of the followers of that 81,000 people who came and followed me in 2023 came from a a select like two three four five tweets a very small amount of tweets two weeks ago I had a tweet had 70 plus thousand likes and was seen by 20 million people just goes to show you that you got to continue to be consistent and you never know when you're going to pull the slot machine and the algorithm gods are going to let the floodgates open so that's Twitter for you and also some other platforms but definitely my experience with Twitter YouTube subscribers I start you know a year ago I had about 8,000 subscribers today I have 11,300 YouTube is hard but I'm not giving it up I think it's a worthwhile investment honestly Please Subscribe uh uh so I know that you're enjoying it that's the only way I can know um but I've given it a lot of work I started doing these five to 10 minute videos um I did about five or six of those where I break down people like Ryan holiday and Jack Butcher and Colin and Samir and I talk about multi preneurship so I'll do these shorter videos not just long form and not just shorts and I thought actually that that would get me like go viral kind of like how that one tweet I had got 70,000 likes but it hasn't happened yet but I'm still a Believer so I'm going to continue to invest in it but yeah let me know if uh let me know if you don't like it I I'm I you know I think that some of the videos are valuable so I'm going to continue doing it the podcast my podcast it's called where it happens you're listening to it probably uh this is this is the podcast um no growth 2020 2 I had 360,000 downloads in 2023 I had 360,000 downloads so there's been no growth but the podcast has been a lesson it reminds me of the quote over the years I've learned that the first idea you have is irrelevant it's just a catalyst for you to get started then you figure out what's wrong with it and you go through phases of denial Panic regret then you finally have a better idea and the second idea is always the important one so what do I mean by that I mean I started the podcast at the end of 2021 I had a co-host that didn't last and I shifted it from there I shifted it again and only towards the end of 2023 did I really really feel as if I started to get a grapple of what what I want my podcast to be and I want it to be an ideas podcast I want I want people to bring I you know bring ideas I want to hash out ideas I want them to be ideas that are powered by Community powered by internet audiences powered by the internet I don't want to do another interview style podcast I think there's enough of those so although the podcast wasn't successful in the sense that it didn't get millions of downloads anecdotally I feel like over the last six months a lot of you have reached out to me and have said hey I really enjoy the podcast and I like where it's going so I'm going to continue creating it for you and uh yeah just a reminder that all these things are Evolutions all right and last social platform Linkin a year ago I had 10,000 followers now I have 82,000 followers I'd been sleeping on LinkedIn and I had already been writing tweets for years so yeah what I basically do is I take my tweets and I put it on LinkedIn simple as that and I comment you know with my community there um and that's it so nice to have that audience okay products I loved using in 2023 and I'm not involved with any of these products I just I liked using them um so the ones that came to mind is clack KL a c k for those of you who love the sound of mechanical keyboards clock clock clock clock clock I'm one of those people I feel it feel like it's pretty satisfying when I do that and uh the problem with doing it though is it's loud and it gets annoying for people in the room and if you're on a call it gets annoying if you're typing other people are like what is that so clock isett pretty cool cuz it's just an app that you download in the Apple Store on your Mac and you could set it up and you can make it different you know different volumes do you want it loud do you want it balance you can change the what the Clack sounds like do you want it to be clack clack clack do you want it to be click click click it helps you do that it's $5 and it makes me feel like I'm being more productive because I'm I'm clacking away I don't know can't I can't explain it but clock helps Apple Studio display so I'm looking at you now if you're watching this on YouTube on a Apple Studio display it's $15.99 which is absolutely crazy for a screen you know screens cost a few hundred dollars but I enjoy writing on it so much more I enjoying being in my being just on the computer so much more so it pays dividends and you stare at this thing eight hours a day at least so you want something that's beautiful 5K and I I don't know man it's beautiful what can I say I love looking at it too it's like a piece of art so highly recommend the third product I enjoyed dabbling into in 2023 was fire is fire belly tea so I'm a coffee guy but if you're watching this on YouTube this is some tea and uh in the afternoon this is the afternoon while I'm recording this I I become a tea person so coffee in the morning tea in the afternoon better for sleep I just love enjoying I enjoy just sipping working sipping working sipping working and you can't do that unless it's decaf I guess coffee all day or else you you know just unsustainable to have 10 cups of coffee a day so Tea's been really great and Firebelly which is loose tea my my friend Harley finlin president of Shopify got me onto it because he's a co-founder of that company and I steep My Own tea it's a it's a ritual I love doing and I think we got tea most people got tea wrong at least in North America like we think of tea as tea bags but once you have real loose leaf tea that's delicious it really does um change the game and it's a beautiful experience feels really good it's doing something to me too I don't know I I I I think clear I can't recommend it and not Firebelly tea we're going to I'll put the links to all these products in the description so you can you can try some of it if you're interested um the fourth thing is Beam Beam dream so like many Founders I have trouble sleeping so instead of grabbing a prescription pill in 2023 I started using dream powder when I can't fall asleep and I sleep like a baby it's this cocoa that you have you mix it up it's like a mix of like melatonin some CBD some RI lanine I think is another one thing in there and I know what you're thinking you're likew I tried all these things and it doesn't I still can't sleep I don't know it's the combination of all of them make this thing like work like a charm like I'm out I sleep like a baby so highly recommend beam probably one of the biggest Lifesavers that I had in in 2023 because if you're tired all the time it's just good luck being productive and possible and honestly good luck like enjoying your life like it's tough uh if you're tired you feel like this weird you're in this weird State it's cloudy it doesn't feel good you're more agitated so not fun and last product I love using the yumo hiyoshi porcelain mugs I went to Japan a few months ago and I found these we watching this on YouTube these little cups mugs by an incredible designer and Porcelain and I love the sound of it and I love the color way is yeah I think a lot of people including myself were using just like regular mugs and upping my mug game din wear game was helpful 2023 and don't just get the big box Walmart stuff it's worth it if you're especially if you're working from home make your make your space feel spiritual make it feel amazing make it feel like you're excited so these little things and and even if you don't work from home like these mugs are are amazing and a a lot of my friends talk about the Ember mug which is that that mug that is like a smart mug that keeps your coffee or or beverage warm at a particular temperature and I thought about getting that and then I went the complete other direction yo mugs are like the complete opposite and uh it's okay if your coffee gets cold it's okay if you want to heat it up it's okay if you want to brew something a new one you know like you don't need to be productive eight hours a day in front of the computer not moving you know I think having having these little breaks are really helpful especially for creatives so those are the products top products I loved using next thing I want to talk about is my net worth it's gone up 20% year-over-year and I wanted to do a breakdown of my invest Investments as of December 20123 this is not Financial advice do your own research just telling you what I have done so I'll break it out in order of biggest to smallest Holdings spy which is the ticker for um S&P 500 so basically the S&P 500 is 20% of my investments private equity which is VC Angel Investments it's about 177% of my net worth spy which is the value investment part of the Spy S&P is about 8% Berkshire halfway A and B is 8% Microsoft 7% Amazon 6% wld which is cloud companies it's the top 100 Cloud companies by besser it's 5% that's a newer trade my thesis there was that all these Cloud companies and SAS companies are going to add Ai and they're just going to be much more valuable so that's my thesis there cash 5% fixed income 5% Apple 4% Google 3% I had a bigger stake in Google and trimmed it a little bit Roy Roy Ro bank and I trimmed it because of and put it into Microsoft basically Royal Bank of Canada 2% good dividend stock TD Toronto Dominion another large Canadian Bank big dividends 2% other stocks 3% real estate 3% Bitcoin and ethereum 2% and uh before you crypto people come after me and and say why why don't you have more in Bitcoin and ethereum well number one I think one to 2% is is a good amount for people to start with and uh number two I have backed some web 3 fund managers crypto fund managers some of my private Equity Investments are in crypto web 3 type thing so there's a few probably a few extra percent there in terms of my net worth update I don't count late checkout Equity I don't count my 401k I don't count my car my Volvo it's on in that calculation so that's my net worth update and then the lake checkout Holdings update what's going on with our businesses we talked a little bit about them but I'll go I'll go a bit deeper so we've got a few businesses we're running one is the late checkout Innovation agency so I think of think of this as like the Moder day Ido or the McKenzie for product design but we've got this Special Sauce which is communitybased design which is like we get into a community we understand them we design for them I think this is going to be a big year for that business for a few reasons companies have like laid off the tech companies have laid off a lot of people but they still need products and uh so we're getting a lot of inbound there and uh yeah I just think uh there's an opportunity here so uh we've got some incredible case studies of adding Bill literally billions of dollars of market caps to companies through products we've created so that's the thing when you're building like a Innovation type agency like the case studies are really important and that stuff takes time so I expect that business to do several million dollars of free cash flow 2024 boring marketing.com I can't believe the growth of this business started like s months ago it's 28 employees and and honestly the growth of the boring marketing movement so like this whole idea of you know you've heard of boring businesses you might have not heard of boring marketing we helped invent that movement that concept our Twitter is 30 thou almost 30,000 people this year I think it's 29,000 people people definitely resonate with the concept the business is flying and then we often joke internally that boring will turn into its own hold holding company and it'll be bigger than lay checkout and we recently expanded the business from just SEO to paid ads and some new Services coming soon so that's really going to make this business fly I'd expect this business to be 60 plus 70 plus employees by the end of 2024 third business you probably need a robot.com we started it this year it's a community for people interested in Ai and automation we added a newsletter there's 60,000 people signed up uh we're still trying to figure out like the business angle of it like we've sold some things we've sold something called robot pass which is basically a way to get you pay like 100 bucks or something and you get discounts on all the AI tools we've done stuff like that we did a Asing course like an email based course that you can pay for paid Community type stuff so I think we're still trying to figure out how do we monetize it but being in the center of AI and really you know learning and about it and and that's another cool thing about building a community is it allows you to be a center of gravity for some really cool people so that's been really awesome meet dispatch.com so is at a sixf figure a month business and it's been an interesting experiment clients love us to be their design partner we've done some really cool work but there's actually a bigger opportunity in 2024 we're going to evolve it I'm not ready to talk I don't think I'm ready to talk about exactly what that is but TBD stay tuned Community Empire so Community Empire is a membership we launched it a few months ago uh it's for people who are interested in building businesses powered by community so it's basically people like me who are into the same sort of stuff I'm into and it's definitely working we priced it so low to basically make it a no-brainer so it's on this platform called school it's $99 a month and if you want to start your and we basically say everyone should start a school for a lot of reasons and but the biggest reason is just it's an incredible lead a community is an incredible lead magnet call a community magnet so if you have an internet audience and you want to get their emails you don't want to be reliant on Twitter or Instagram you funnel them into a community you get their emails you nurture them and you sell them a product that could be a paid product like you can charge for access to a paid Community but it can also just be like a a SAS product a consumer software business a physical location cpg coaching agency so yeah launched a couple months ago we're already doing $20,000 a month of Revenue people love that they get the you know they're paying $99 a month and they get the free school which cost $99 a month usually but free with our group My Hope Is that I acquire someone's business in here like they they go through our playbooks because basically Community Empire is like all my playbooks like distilled plus like peer-to-peer mentorship plus a bunch you know these things called Sprints anyways the point is you can check it out if you're interested but the point is like the real value here is not to make $20,000 a month although that's like pretty awesome cuz if you think but it's a quarter of a million dollars if you value that at 10x AR that's like $2.5 million Enterprise Value created overnight like some of these paid communities like a lot of people should start paid communities so yeah anyways that Community Empire I'm excited to see where it goes I'm not sure where it's going to go uh that's the thing with Community Based you know paid communities you kind of have to see what people want and where you know like for example I would have never thought that we would do a monthly email with here's like two or three niches and and that we we're seeing and here's the trends and like here's some business ideas like I never expected it to be a monthly business idea like almost research trendy type email um but people people wanted it people wanted people yeah people wanted it so we'll see where it goes and uh yeah we've also got a bunch of experiments that are cooking in the holding company and I'll talk more about that uh in the new year I think with the holding company I just really want to embody the build skyscrapers not strip malls mentality meaning like we've got a bunch of businesses that are really working let's go build experiments for these businesses uh instead of incubating 10 new businesses so we will be incubating a few new businesses we'll be buying a few new businesses but we're really focusing on adding fuel to the fire to a bunch of these which just are really working and uh it just goes to show you like I started you know three and a half years ago I I had basically no no followings on the Internet or very small followings and uh I was a guy who created Venture back startups now I'm a bootstrap got a bunch of businesses running having way more fun loving writing loving podcasting uh feeling really energized and thank you know it's corny to say but thank you thank you for listening thank you for watching thank you for replying thank you for liking thank you for subscribing and uh I hope I added value to your life in 2023 and I will continue to do that in 2024 so let me know in the comments if I did if you have any thoughts about this share this video share this podcast with your friends your family anyone who you think could be useful too and uh hope you have a great great start to your 2024 let's go get it

Title: The Problem With Putting Entrepreneurs On A Pedestal, With Lean Startup Eric Ries

Description:

We love to put famous entrepreneurs up on a pedestal.

If we were asked who’s behind Tesla’s success, we would undoubtedly say “Elon Musk.”

And if we were asked the same thing about Facebook, then the answer would probably be “Mark Zuckerberg.”

While the accomplishments of these men are nothing short of impressive, we must remember that behind all of these success stories there’s a team of talented people that don’t always get the recognition they deserve.

there's only one path or only one kind of person that's really valuable and of course we're in a hierarchical patriarchical society that is just we love to put Elon Musk type figures up on the pedestal and make it about them personally and not to take anything away from the accomplishments of the so-called great men of history but there's a lot of other people involved there's a number two and the number 10 and there's all these other people involved even with those success stories and then you have thousands or even millions of other people that are finding ways to benefit from the new technology

Title: What Does Success Look Like For A Business?
Published: 2023-12-25 13:00:32 UTC
Description:
https://www.youtube.com/@GregIsenberg

Create your own definition of success.

The criteria founders use to measure the success of their business depend on their industry, size, goals, and circumstances, so what “success” looks like for another company doesn’t necessarily apply to yours. 

When you’re starting out, define how big or small do you want your business to be and what success looks like for your particular venture.

Business building is a long-term game. 

And despite what some internet gurus might tell you, it takes years of pain and sacrifice to build a profitable business.

If you’re entering the world of entrepreneurship, make sure you’re doing it because it fuels you and not because you’re seeking validation from others. You’ll be setting yourself up for a lot of pain.

Title: What We Get Wrong About Entrepreneurship
Published: 2023-12-23 13:00:52 UTC
Description:
https://www.youtube.com/@GregIsenberg

We’ve got entrepreneurship all wrong.

Especially in the early days, we seek to do things that are high-status like getting a big check from a venture capital fund and seeing our valuation go up. This is nothing but fool’s gold. 

The real opportunity lies in doing things that feel fulfilling and with the potential to turn into high status at some point.

human beings whether we like to admit it or not seek to do things that are high status when I was in my 20s doing a venture back startup was high status raising money from Sequoia or injuries and horowits that gave you the stamp of approval that you're doing something cool getting a big check from a venture capital fund was really cool and seeing your valuation go up and up and up and up was high status the interesting thing is where the opportunity is is actually things that are low status that turn into high status do things that feel fulfilling and do things that potentially are low status that you think will be high status in 5 to 10 years
